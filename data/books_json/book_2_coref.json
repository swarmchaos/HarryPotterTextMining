  "THE WORST BIRTHDAY": [
    "Not for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four, Privet Drive. Mr. Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from Mr. Vernon Dursley nephew Harry's room. ",
    "\"Third time this week!\" Mr. Vernon Dursley roared across the table. \"If you can't control that owl, that owl'll have to go!\" ",
    "Harry tried, yet again, to explain. ",
    "\"She's bored,\" Mr. Vernon Dursley said. \"She's used to flying around outside. If I could just let She out at night -- \" ",
    "\"Do I look stupid?\" snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg dangling from Uncle Vernon bushy mustache. \"I know what 11 happen if that owl's let out.\" ",
    "Uncle Vernon exchanged dark looks with Uncle Vernon wife, Petunia. ",
    "Harry tried to argue back but Harry words were drowned by a long, loud belch from the Dursleys' son, Dudley. ",
    "\"I want more bacon.\" ",
    "\"There's more in the frying pan, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia, turning misty eyes on Aunt Petunia massive son. \"We must build you up while We've got the chance. ... I don't like the sound of that school food. ...\" ",
    "\"Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when  was at Smeltings,\" said Uncle Vernon heartily. \"Dudley gets enough, don't you, son?\" ",
    "Dudley, who was so large Dudley bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair, grinned and turned to Harry. ",
    "\"Pass the frying pan.\" ",
    "\"You've forgotten the magic word,\" said Harry irritably. ",
    "The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible: Dudley gasped and fell off the kitchen chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen; Mrs. Dursley gave a small scream and clapped Mrs. Dursley hands to Mrs. Dursley mouth; Mrs. Dursley jumped to Mrs. Dursley feet, veins throbbing in Mrs. Dursley temples. ",
    "\"I meant 'please'!\" said Harry quickly. \"I didn't mean ",
    "\"WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,\" thundered Harry uncle, spraying spit over the table, \"ABOUT SAYING THE 'M' WORD IN OUR HOUSE?\" ",
    "\"But I -- \" ",
    "\"HOW DARE Dudley!\" roared Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with Uncle Vernon fist. ",
    "\"I just -- \" ",
    "\"I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!\" ",
    "Harry stared from \" ",
    "Harry purple-faced uncle to \" ",
    "Harry pale aunt, who was trying to heave Dudley to \" ",
    "Harry . ",
    "\"All right,\" said Harry, \"all right ...\" ",
    "Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of the corners of Harry small, sharp eyes. ",
    "Ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, \" ",
    "Uncle Vernon had been treating \" ",
    "Uncle Vernon like a bomb that might go off at any moment, because Harry Potter wasn't a normal boy. As a matter of fact, \" ",
    "Uncle Vernon was as not normal as it is possible to be. ",
    "Harry Potter was a wizard -- a wizard fresh from \" ",
    "Uncle Vernon first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And if the Dursleys were unhappy to have \" ",
    "Uncle Vernon back for the holidays, it was nothing to how Harry felt. ",
    "Harry missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomachache. Harry missed the castle, with the castle secret passageways and ghosts, Harry classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in Harry four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in Harry cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world (six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on broomsticks). ",
    "All Harry's spellbooks, Harry wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home. What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost Harry place on the House Quidditch team because Harry hadn't practiced all summer? What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went back to school without any of Harry homework done? ",
    "the Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles (not a drop of magical blood in their veins), and as far as their were concerned, having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harry's owl, Hedwig, inside Uncle Vernon cage, to stop Uncle Vernon from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world. ",
    "Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy. Harry wore round glasses, and on Harry forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar. ",
    "It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard. a thin, lightning-shaped scar was the only hint of Harry's very mysterious past, of the reason Harry had been left on the Dursleys' doorstep eleven years before. ",
    "At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak. Harry's parents had died in Voldemort's attack, but Harry had escaped with Harry lightning scar, and somehow -- nobody understood why -- Voldemort's powers had been destroyed the instant Harry had failed to kill Harry. ",
    "So Harry had been brought up by Harry dead mother's sister and Harry husband. Harry had spent ten years with the Dursleys', never understanding why Harry kept making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the Dursleys' story that Harry had got Harry scar in the car crash that had killed Harry parents. ",
    "And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry, and the whole story had come out. Harry had taken up Harry place at wizard school, where Harry and his lightning scar were famous . . . but now the school year was over, and Harry was back with the Dursleys' for the summer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly. ",
    "the Dursleys' hadn't even remembered that today happened to be Harry's twelfth birthday. Of course, Harry hopes hadn't been high; they'd never given Harry a real present, let alone a cake -- but to ignore a real present completely ... ",
    "At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared Uncle Vernon throat importantly and said, \"Now, as we all know, today is a very important day.\" ",
    "Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it. ",
    "\"This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career,\" said Uncle Vernon. ",
    "Harry went back to Harry toast. Of course, Harry thought bitterly, Uncle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party. Harry'd been talking of nothing else for two weeks. Some rich builder and Harry wife were coming to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge order from Uncle Vernon (Uncle Vernon's company made drills). ",
    "\"I think we should run through the schedule one more time,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"we should all be in position at eight o'clock. Petunia, you will be -- ?\" ",
    "\"In the lounge,\" said Petunia promptly, \"waiting to welcome them graciously to we home.\" ",
    "\"Good, good. And Dudley?\" ",
    "\"I'll be waiting to open the door.\" Dudley put on a foul, simpering smile. \"May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?\" ",
    "\"your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason'll love your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason!\" cried Petunia rapturously. ",
    "\"Excellent, Dudley,\" said Uncle Vernon. Then Harry rounded on Harry. \"And you?\" ",
    "\"I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,\" said Harry tonelessly. ",
    "\"Exactly,\" said Uncle Vernon nastily. \"I will lead your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason into the lounge, introduce you, Petunia, and pour your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason drinks. At eight-fifteen -- \" ",
    "\"I'll announce dinner,\" said Petunia. ",
    "\"And, Dudley, you 11 say -- \" ",
    "\"May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?\" said Dudley, offering Dudley fat arm to an invisible woman. ",
    "\"My perfect little gentleman!\" sniffed Petunia. ",
    "\"And you?\" said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry. ",
    "\"I'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,\" said Harry dully. ",
    "\"Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner. Petunia, any ideas?\" ",
    "Uncle Vernon tells me you're a wonderful golfer, Mr. ",
    "Mason. ... Do tell me where you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason. ...\" ",
    "\"Perfect ... Dudley?\" ",
    "\"How about -- 'We had to write an essay about We hero at school, Mr. Mason, and I wrote about Mr. Mason.' \" ",
    "This was too much for both Petunia and Harry. Petunia burst into tears and hugged Petunia son, while Harry ducked under the table so they wouldn't see her son laughing. ",
    "\"And you, boy?\" ",
    "Harry fought to keep Harry face straight as Harry emerged. ",
    "\"I'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,\" Harry said. ",
    "\"Too right, you will,\" said Uncle Vernon forcefully. ",
    "\"The Masons don't know anything about you and it's going to stay that way. When dinner's over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia, and I'll bring the subject around to drills. With any luck, I'll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten. We'll be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time tomorrow.\" ",
    "Harry couldn't feel too excited about this. Harry didn't think the Dursleys' would like Harry any better in Majorca than they did on Privet Drive. ",
    "\"Right -- I'm off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for Dudley and me. And you,\" Harry snarled at HarryHarry. \"You stay out of your aunt's way while she's cleaning.\" ",
    "Harry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day. Harry crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sang under Harry breath: ",
    "\"Happy birthday to Harry ... happy birthday to Harry ...\" ",
    "No cards, no presents, and Harry would be spending the evening pretending not to exist. Harry gazed miserably into the hedge. Harry had never felt so lonely. More than anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing Quidditch, Harry missed Harry best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, however, didn't seem to be missing Harry at all. Neither of his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger had written to Harry all summer, even though Harry had said Harry was going to ask Harry to come and stay. ",
    "Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig's cage by magic and sending her to Harry and Hermione with a letter, but it wasn't worth the risk. Underage wizards weren't allowed to use magic outside of school. Harry hadn't told the Dursleys' this; Harry knew it was only Underage wizards terror that Harry might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking Harry in the cupboard under the stairs with Harry wand and broomstick. For the first couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under Harry breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as Dudley fat legs would carry Dudley. But the long silence from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal -- and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten Harry birthday. ",
    "What wouldn't Harry give now for a message from Hogwarts? From any witch or wizard? Harry'd almost be ",
    "glad of a sight of Harry archenemy, Draco Malfoy, just to be sure it hadn't all been a dream. ... ",
    "Not that Harry whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end of last term, Harry had come face-to-face with none other than Voldemort. Voldemort might be a ruin of Voldemort former self, but Voldemort was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power. Harry had slipped through Voldemort's clutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where Voldemort was now, remembering face-to-face, Harry wide, mad eyes -- ",
    "Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. Harry had been staring absent-mindedly into the hedge -- and the hedge was staring back. Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves. ",
    "Harry jumped to Harry feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn. ",
    "\"I know what day it is,\" sang Dudley, waddling toward Harry. ",
    "Two enormous green eyes blinked and vanished. ",
    "\"What?\" said Harry, not taking Two enormous green eyes off the spot where they had been. ",
    "\"I know what day it is,\" Dudley repeated, coming right up to Dudley. ",
    "\"Well done,\" said Harry. \"So you've finally learned the days of the week.\" ",
    "\"Today's your birthday,\" sneered Dudley. \"How come you haven't got any cards? Haven't you even got friends at that freak place?\" ",
    "\"Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school,\" said Harry coolly. ",
    "Dudley hitched up Dudley trousers, which were slipping down Dudley fat bottom. ",
    "\"Why're you staring at the hedge?\" Dudley said suspiciously. ",
    "\"I'm trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire,\" said Harry. ",
    "Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on Dudley fat face. ",
    "\"You c-can't -- Dad told you you're not to do m-magic -- Dad said hell chuck you out of the house -- and you haven't got anywhere else to go -- you haven't got any friends to take you -- \" ",
    "\" Jiggery pokeryV ' said Harry in a fierce voice. \"Hocus pocus -- squiggly wiggly -- \" ",
    "\"MUUUUUUM!\" howled Dudley, tripping over Hocus pocus -- squiggly wiggly -- \" ",
    "\"MUUUUUUM as Hocus pocus -- squiggly wiggly -- \" ",
    "\"MUUUUUUM dashed back toward the house. \"MUUUUM! ",
    "Hocus pocus -- squiggly wiggly -- \" ",
    "\"MUUUUUUM's doing you know what!\" ",
    "Harry paid dearly for Harry moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Petunia knew Petunia hadn't really done magic, but Petunia still had to duck as Petunia aimed a heavy blow at Petunia head with the soapy frying pan. Then Petunia gave Petunia work to do, with the promise Petunia wouldn't eat again until Petunia'd finished. ",
    "While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench. The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of Harry neck. Harry knew Harry shouldn't have risen to Dudley's bait, but Dudley had said the very thing Harry had been thinking Harry ... maybe Harry didn't have any friends at Hogwarts. ... ",
    "Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now, famous Harry Potter thought savagely as famous Harry Potter spread manure on the flower beds, famous Harry Potter back aching, sweat running down famous Harry Potter . ",
    "It was half past seven in the evening when at last, exhausted, famous Harry Potter heard Petunia calling famous Harry Potter. ",
    "\"Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!Harry Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On top of the fridge stood tonight's pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets. A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven. ",
    "\"Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!\" snapped Petunia, pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table. Petunia was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress. ",
    "Harry washed Harry hands and bolted down Harry pitiful supper. The moment Harry had finished, Petunia whisked away Harry plate. \"Upstairs! Hurry!\" ",
    "As Harry passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets. Harry had only just reached the upstairs landing when the doorbell rang and Uncle Vernon furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs. ",
    "\"Remember, boy -- one sound -- Harry Harry crossed to Harry bedroom on tiptoe, slipped inside, closed the door, and turned to collapse on Harry bed. ",
    "The trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it. "

  "DOBBY'S WARNING": [
    "Harry managed not to shout out, but DOBBY'S WARNING ",
    "Harry was a close thing. The little creature on his bed had large, bat- like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls. Harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching Harry out of the garden hedge that morning. ",
    "As they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley's voice from the hall. ",
    "\"May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?\" ",
    "The little creature on the bed slipped off his bed and bowed so low that the end of The little creature on the bed long, thin nose touched the carpet. Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes. ",
    "\"Er -- hello,\" said Harry nervously. ",
    "\"Harry Potter!\" said the creature in a high-pitched voice Harry was sure would carry down the stairs. \"So ",
    "long has DOBBY wanted to meet you, sir ... Such an honor it is. ...\" ",
    "\"Th-thank you,\" said Harry, edging along the wall and sinking into Harry desk chair, next to Hedwig, who was asleep in her large cage. Harry wanted to ask, \"What are you?\" but thought it would sound too rude, so instead Harry said, \"Who are you?\" ",
    "\"Dobby, sir. DOBBY. Dobby the house-elf,\" said The little creature on the bed. ",
    "\"Oh -- really?\" said Harry. \"Er -- I don't want to be rude or anything, but -- this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.\" ",
    "Petunia's high, false laugh sounded from the living room. a house-elf hung his head. ",
    "\"Not that I'm not pleased to meet you,\" said Harry quickly, \"but, er, is there any particular reason you're here?\" ",
    "\"Oh, yes, sir,\" said DOBBY earnestly. \"DOBBY has come to tell you, sir ... it is difficult, sir ... DOBBY wonders where to begin. ...\" ",
    "\"Sit down,\" said Harry politely, pointing at his bed. ",
    "To Harry horror, a house-elf burst into tears -- very noisy tears. ",
    "\"S-sit down).\" Harry wailed. \"Never ... never ever ...Harry Harry thought Harry heard the voices downstairs falter. ",
    "\"I'm sorry,\" Harry whispered, \"I didn't mean to offend you or anything -- \" ",
    "\"Offend DOBBY!\" choked a house-elf. \"DOBBY has never been asked to sit down by a wizard -- like an equal -- ",
    "Harry, trying to say \"Shh!\" and look comforting at the same time, ushered DOBBY back onto the bed where DOBBY sat hiccoughing, looking like a large and very ugly doll. At last DOBBY managed to control DOBBY, and sat with DOBBY great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of watery adoration. ",
    "\"You can't have met many decent wizards,\" said Harry, trying to cheer DOBBY up. ",
    "DOBBY shook his head. Then, without warning, DOBBY leapt up and started banging his head furiously on the window, shouting, \"Bad Dobby! Bad DOBBY!\" ",
    "\"Don't -- what are you doing?\" Harry hissed, springing up and pulling DOBBY back onto his bed -- Hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating Hedwig wings wildly against the bars of Hedwig cage. ",
    "DOBBY DOBBY had to punish DOBBY, sir,\" said the elf, who had gone slightly cross-eyed. \"DOBBY almost spoke ill of DOBBY family, sir. ...\" ",
    "\"Your family?\" ",
    "\"The wizard family DOBBY serves, sir. ... DOBBY is a house-elf -- bound to serve one house and one family forever. ...\" ",
    "\"Do they know you're here?\" asked Harry curiously. DOBBY shuddered. ",
    "\"Oh, no, sir, no ... DOBBY will have to punish sir most grievously for coming to see you, sir. DOBBY will have to shut sir ears in the oven door for this. If they ever knew, sir -- \" ",
    "\"But won't they notice if you shut his ears in the oven door?\" ",
    "DOBBY doubts it, sir. DOBBY is always having to punish DOBBY for something, sir. they lets DOBBY get on with DOBBY, sir. Sometimes they reminds me to do extra punishments. ...\" ",
    "\"But why don't you leave? Escape?\" ",
    "\"A house-elf must be set free, sir. And the family will never set DOBBY free . . . DOBBY will serve the family until DOBBY dies, sir. ...\" ",
    "Harry stared. ",
    "\"And I thought I had it bad staying here for another four weeks,\" Harry said. \"This makes the Dursleys sound almost human. Can't anyone help you? Can't I?\" ",
    "Almost at once, Harry wished Harry hadn't spoken. ",
    "DOBBY dissolved again into wails of gratitude. ",
    "\"Please,\" Harry whispered frantically, \"please be quiet. If the Dursleys hear anything, if the Dursleys hear anything know you're here -- \" ",
    "\"Harry Potter asks if \"Harry Potter can help DOBBY . . . DOBBY has heard of your greatness, sir, but of your goodness, DOBBY never knew. ...\" ",
    "Harry, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said, \"Whatever you've heard about my greatness is a load ",
    "of rubbish. I'm not even top of my year at Hogwarts; that's Hermione, she -- \" ",
    "But DOBBY stopped quickly, because thinking about Hermione was painful. ",
    "\"Harry Potter is humble and modest,\" said DOBBY reverently, \"Harry Potter orb-like eyes aglow. \"\"Harry Potter speaks not of \"Harry Potter triumph over He-Who-Must-Not-Be- Named -- \" ",
    "\"Voldemort?\" said Harry. ",
    "DOBBY clapped DOBBY over DOBBY bat ears and moaned, \"Ah, speak not the name, sir! Speak not the name!\" ",
    "\"Sorry,\" said Harry quickly. \"I know lots of people don't like it. My friend Ron -- \" ",
    "My friend Ron stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, too. ",
    "DOBBY leaned toward Harry, Ron eyes wide as headlights. ",
    "\"DOBBY heard tell,\" Ron said hoarsely, \"that \"Harry Potter met the Dark Lord for a second time, just weeks ago ... that \"Harry Potter escaped yet again.\" ",
    "Harry nodded and DOBBY's eyes suddenly shone with tears. ",
    "\"Ah, sir,\" Harry gasped, dabbing face-to-face with a corner of the grubby pillowcase Harry was wearing. \"\"Harry Potter is valiant and bold! Harry has braved so many dangers already! But DOBBY has come to protect \"Harry Potter, to warn Harry, even if Harry does have to shut Harry ears in ",
    "the oven door later. . . . \"Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts.\" ",
    "There was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from downstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon voice. ",
    "\"W-what?\" Harry stammered. \"But I've got to go back -- term starts on September first. It's all that's keeping me going. You don't know what it's like here. ",
    "I don't belong here. I belong in your world -- at Hogwarts.\" ",
    "\"No, no, no,\" squeaked Dobby, shaking Harry head so hard Harry ears flapped. \"\"Harry Potter must stay where \"Harry Potter is safe. \"Harry Potter is too great, too good, to lose. If \"Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts, \"Harry Potter will be in mortal danger.\" ",
    "\"Why?\" said Harry in surprise. ",
    "\"There is a plot, \"Harry Potter. A plot to make most terrible things happen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year,\" whispered DOBBY, suddenly trembling all over. \"DOBBY has known DOBBY for months, sir. \"Harry Potter must not put \"Harry Potter in peril. \"Harry Potter is too important, sir!\" ",
    "\"What terrible things?\" said Harry at once. \"Who's plotting them?DOBBY DOBBY made a funny choking noise and then banged his head frantically against the wall. ",
    "\"All right!\" cried Harry, grabbing the elf's arm to stop Harry. \"You can't tell me. I understand. But why are you warning me?\" A sudden, unpleasant thought struck Harry. \"Hang on -- this hasn't got anything to do with Vol -- sorry -- with You-Know-Who, has it?  ",
    "You could just shake or nod,\" he added hastily as DOBBY's head tilted worryingly close to the wall again. ",
    "Slowly, DOBBY shook he . ",
    "\"Not -- not He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, sir -- \" ",
    "But DOBBY's eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give Harry a hint. Harry, however, was completely lost. ",
    "\"he hasn't got a brother, has he?\" ",
    "DOBBY shook he head, DOBBY eyes wider than ever. ",
    "\"Well then, I can't think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at Hogwarts,\" said Harry. \"I mean, there's Dumbledore, for one thing -- you know who Dumbledore is, don't you?\" ",
    "DOBBY bowed Dumbledore head. ",
    "Dumbledore Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had. DOBBY knows DOBBY, sir. DOBBY has heard Dumbledore's powers rival those of He- Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his strength. But, sir\" -- DOBBY's voice dropped to an urgent whisper -- \"there are powers Dumbledore doesn't ... powers no decent wizard ...\" ",
    "And before Harry could stop Harry, DOBBY bounded off his bed, seized Harry's desk lamp, and started beating Harry around the head with earsplitting yelps. ",
    "A sudden silence fell downstairs. Two seconds later Harry, heart thudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon ",
    "coming into the hall, calling, \"Dudley must have left Uncle Vernon ",
    " television on again, the little tyke!\" ",
    "\"Quick! In the closet!\" hissed Harry, stuffing DOBBY in, shutting the door, and flinging Harry onto his bed just as the door handle turned. ",
    "\"What -- the -- devil -- are -- you -- doing?\" said Uncle Vernon ",
    " through gritted teeth, Uncle Vernon ",
    " horribly close to Harry's. \"You've just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke. ... One more sound and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy!\" ",
    "Uncle Vernon ",
    " stomped flat-footed from the room. ",
    "Shaking, Harry let DOBBY out of the closet. ",
    "\"See what it's like here?\" Harry said. \"See why I've got to go back to Hogwarts? It's the only place I've got -- well, I think I've got friends.\" ",
    "\"Friends who don't even write to \"Harry Potter?\" said DOBBY slyly. ",
    "\"I expect friends've just been -- wait a minute,\" said Harry, frowning. \"How do you know my friends haven't been writing to Harry?DOBBY shuffled DOBBY feet. ",
    "\"Harry Potter \"Harry Potter mustn't be angry with DOBBY. DOBBY did it for the best -- \" ",
    "\"Have you been stopping my letters?\" ",
    "DOBBY DOBBY has them here, sir,\" said a house-elf. Stepping nimbly out of Harry's reach, Harry pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase Harry was wearing. Harry could make out Hermione's neat ",
    "writing, Ron's untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid. ",
    "DOBBY blinked anxiously up at Harry. ",
    "\"Harry Potter \"Harry Potter mustn't be angry. ... DOBBY hoped ... if \"Harry Potter thought \"Harry Potter friends had forgotten \"Harry Potter . . . \"Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir. ",
    "Harry wasn't listening. Harry made a grab for the letters, but DOBBY jumped out of reach. ",
    "\"Harry Potter \"Harry Potter will have \"Harry Potter, sir, if \"Harry Potter gives DOBBY \"Harry Potter word that \"Harry Potter will not return to Hogwarts. Ah, sir, this is a danger you must not face! Say you won't go back, sir!\" ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry angrily. \"Give me my friends' letters!\" ",
    "\"Then \"Harry Potter leaves DOBBY no choice,\" said a house-elf sadly. ",
    "Before Harry could move, DOBBY had darted to the bedroom door, pulled DOBBY open, and sprinted down the stairs. ",
    "Mouth dry, stomach lurching, Harry sprang after Harry, trying not to make a sound. Harry jumped the last six steps, landing catlike on the hall carpet, looking around for DOBBY. From the dining room Harry heard Uncle Vernon ",
    " saying, \"... tell Petunia that very funny story about those American plumbers, Mr. Mason. Uncle Vernon ",
    "'s been dying to hear ...\" ",
    "Harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt \" ",
    "Harry stomach disappear. ",
    "Petunia's masterpiece of a pudding, the mountain of cream and sugared violets, was floating up near the ceiling. On top of a cupboard in the corner crouched DOBBY. ",
    "\"No,\" croaked Harry. \"Please ... they'll kill me. ...\" \"\"Harry Potter must say \"Harry Potter's not going back to school ",
    "\"Dobby ... please ...\" ",
    "\"Say it, sir -- \" ",
    "\"I can't -- DOBBY DOBBY gave \"Harry Potter a tragic look. ",
    "\"Then DOBBY must do DOBBY, sir, for \"Harry Potter own good.\" ",
    "The pudding fell to the floor with a heart-stopping crash. Cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered. With a crack like a whip, DOBBY vanished. ",
    "There were screams from the dining room and Uncle Vernon ",
    " burst into the kitchen to find Harry, rigid with shock, covered from head to foot in Aunt Petunia's pudding. ",

Mrs. Mason stayed just long enough to tell the Dursleys that Mrs. Mason wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes, and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke. ",

    " paid a man to fit bars on Harry's window. Uncle Vernon ",
    " fitted a cat-flap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day. They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, Harry was locked in Harry room around the clock. ",
    "Three days later, the Dursleys were showing no sign of relenting, and Harry couldn't see any way out of Harry situation. Harry lay on Harry bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on Harry's window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to Harry. ",
    "What was the good of magicking Harry out of Harry room if Hogwarts would expel Harry for doing it? Yet life at Privet Drive had reached an all-time low. Now that the Dursleys knew the Dursleys weren't going to wake up as fruit bats, the Dursleys had lost the Dursleys only weapon. DOBBY might have saved Harry from horrible happenings at Hogwarts, but the way things were going, Harry'd probably starve to death anyway. ",
    "The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunia hand appeared, pushing a bowl of canned soup into his room around the clock. Harry, whose insides were aching with hunger, jumped off his bed and seized his bed. The soup was stone- cold, but Harry drank half of The soup in one gulp. Then Harry crossed his room around the clock to Hedwig's cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into Hedwig's cage empty food tray. Hedwig's cage ruffled Hedwig's cage feathers and gave Harry a look of deep disgust. ",
    "\"It's no good turning your beak up at your beak -- that's all we've got,\" said Harry grimly. ",
    "Harry put the empty bowl back on the floor next to The cat-flap and lay back down on his bed, somehow even hungrier than Harry had been before The soup. ",
    "Supposing Harry was still alive in another four weeks, what would happen if Harry didn't turn up at Hogwarts? Would someone be sent to see why someone hadn't come back? Would they be able to make the Dursleys let someone go? ",
    "his room around the clock was growing dark. Exhausted, stomach rumbling, mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions, Harry fell into an uneasy sleep. ",
    "Harry dreamed that Harry was on show in a zoo, with a card reading UNDERAGE WIZARD attached to Hedwig's cage. People goggled through the bars at Harry as Harry lay, starving and weak, on a bed of straw. Harry saw DOBBY's face in the crowd and shouted out, asking for help, but DOBBY called, \"Harry Potter \"Harry Potter is safe there, sir!\" and vanished. Then the Dursleys appeared and Dudley rattled the bars of Hedwig's cage, laughing at Dudley. ",

    "\"What's been going on?\" said Ron. \"Why haven't you been answering my letters? I've asked you to stay about twelve times, and then Dad came home and said you'd got an official warning for using magic in front of Muggles -- \" ",

    "\"But you can't magic me out either -- \" ",
    "\"we don't need to,\" said Ron, jerking Ron head toward the front seat and grinning. \"You forget who I've got with George.\" ",

    "\"If the Dursleys wake up, I'm dead,\" said Harry as Harry tied the rope tightly around a bar and Fred revved up the car. ",
    "\"Don't worry,\" said Fred, \"and stand back.\" ",
    "Harry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig, who seemed to have realized how important this was and kept still and silent. the car revved louder and louder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, the bars were pulled clean out of Harry's window as Fred drove straight up in the air. Harry ran back to Harry's window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the  ",
    "ground. Panting, Ron hoisted them up into the car. Harry listened anxiously, but there was no sound from the Dursleys bedroom. ",
    "When the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron, Fred reversed as close as possible to Harry's window. ",

    "There was a small click and the door swung open. ",
    "\"So -- we'll get your trunk -- you grab anything you need from this room and hand your trunk out to Ron,\" whispered George. ",
    "\"Watch out for the bottom stair -- your trunk creaks,Harry Harry whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing. ",

    " cough. ",
    "At last, panting, his things reached the dark landing, then carried his trunk through Harry's room to the open window. Fred climbed back into the car to pull with Ron, and Harry and George pushed from the bedroom side. Inch by inch, his trunk slid through the open window. ",

    "\"THAT RUDDY OWL!\" ",
    "\"I've forgotten Hedwig!\" ",
    "Harry tore back across this room as the landing light clicked on -- Harry snatched up Hedwig's cage, dashed to the open window, and passed the open window out to Ron. Harry was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when Uncle Vernon ",
    " hammered on the unlocked door -- and the chest of drawers crashed open. ",
    "For a split second, Uncle Vernon ",
    " stood framed in the doorway; then Uncle Vernon ",
    " let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at Harry, grabbing Uncle Vernon ",
    " by the ankle. ",

    "\"Put your foot down, Fred!\" yelled Ron, and the car shot suddenly toward the moon. ",
    "Harry couldn't believe it -- Harry was free. Harry rolled down Harry's window, the night air whipping Harry hair, and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of Privet Drive. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley were all hanging, dumbstruck, out of Harry's window. ",
    "\"See you next summer!\" Harry yelled. ",
    "the Weasleys the Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled back in Harry seat, grinning from ear to ear. ",
    "\"Let Hedwig out,\" Harry told Ron. \"Hedwig can fly behind us. Hedwig hasn't had a chance to stretch Hedwig wings for ages.\" ",
    "George handed the hairpin to Ron and, a moment later, Hedwig soared joyfully out of Harry's window to glide alongside them like a ghost. ",
    "\"So -- what's the story, Harry?\" said Ron impatiently. \"What's been happening?\" ",
    "Harry told them all about Dobby, the warning \" ",
    "Harry'd given Harry and the fiasco of the violet pudding. There was a long, shocked silence when \" ",
    "Harry had finished. ",
    "\"Very fishy,\" said Fred finally. ",
    "\"Definitely dodgy,\" agreed George. \"So George wouldn't even tell you who's supposed to be plotting all this stuff?\" ",
    "\"I don't think George could,\" said Harry. \"I told you, every time George got close to letting something slip, George started banging George against the wall.\" ",
    "George saw \" ",
    "Fred and George look at each other. ",
    "\"What, you think George was lying to George?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Well,\" said Fred, \"put it this way -- house-elves have got powerful magic of house-elves own, but house-elves can't usually use it without house-elves master's permission. I reckon old Dobby was sent to stop you coming back to Hogwarts. Someone's idea of a joke. Can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you?\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Harry and Ron together, instantly. ",
    "\"Draco Malfoy,\" Harry explained. \"Harry hates me.\" ",
    "\"Draco Malfoy?\" said George, turning around. \"Not Lucius Malfoy's son?\" ",
    "\"Must be, it's not a very common name, is it?\" said Harry. \"Why?\" ",
    "\"I've heard Dad talking about Harry,\" said George. \"Harry was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.\" ",
    "\"And when You-Know-Who disappeared,\" said Fred, craning around to look at Harry, \"Lucius Malfoy came back saying Lucius Malfoy'd never meant any of \"Lucius Malfoy. Load of dung -- Dad reckons Lucius Malfoy was right in You-Know- Who's inner circle.\" ",
    "Harry had heard these rumors about \"Lucius Malfoy's family before, and Malfoy's family didn't surprise Harry at all. \"Lucius Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind, thoughtful, and sensitive boy. ",
    "\"I don't know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf. ",
    "...\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Well, whoever owns a house-elf will be an old wizarding family, and an old wizarding family'll be rich,\" said Fred. ",
    "\"Yeah, Mum's always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,\" said George. \"But all we've got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden. house-elves come with big old manors and castles and places like that; you wouldn't catch one in our house. ...\" ",
    "Harry was silent. Judging by the fact that \"Lucius Malfoy usually had the best of everything, \"Lucius Malfoy family was rolling in wizard gold; \"Lucius Malfoy could just see \"Lucius Malfoy strutting around a large manor house. Sending the family servant to stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing \"Lucius Malfoy would do. Had Harry been stupid to take old Dobby seriously? ",
    "\"I'm glad we came to get you, anyway,\" said Ron. \"I was getting really worried when you didn't answer any of my letters. I thought it was Errol's fault at first ",
    "\"Who's Errol?\" ",
    "\"Our owl. \"Our owl's ancient. It wouldn't be the first time \"Our owl'd collapsed on a delivery. So then I tried to borrow Hermes -- \" ",
    "\"Who?\" ",
    "\"The owl Mum and Dad bought Percy when Percy was made prefect,\" said Fred from the front. ",
    "\"But Percy wouldn't lend Percy to Percy,\" said Ron. \"Said Percy needed Ron.\" ",
    "PercyPercy's been acting very oddly this summer,\" said George, frowning. \"And Percy has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in Percy room. ... I mean, there's only so many times you can polish a prefect badge. ... You're driving too far west, Fred,\" Percy added, pointing at a compass on the dashboard. Fred twiddled the steering wheel. ",
    "\"So, does your dad know you've got the car?\" said Harry, guessing the answer. ",
    "\"Er, no,\" said Ron, \"Ron had to work tonight. Hopefully we'll be able to get the car back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew the car.\" ",
    "\"What does your dad do at the Ministry of Magic, anyway?\" ",
    "\"your dad works in the most boring department,\" said Ron. \"The Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.\" ",
    "\"The what?\" ",
    "\"It's all to do with bewitching things that are Muggle- made, you know, in case they end up back in a Muggle shop or house. Like, last year, some old witch died and some old witch tea set was sold to an antiques shop. ",
    "some old witch bought her tea set, took her tea set home, and tried to serve some old witch friends tea in her tea set. her tea set was a nightmare -- Dad was working overtime for weeks.\" ",
    "\"What happened?\" ",
    "\"The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to one man nose. Dad was going frantic -- it's only him and an old warlock called Perkins in the office -- and they had to do Memory Charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up -- ",
    "\"But your dad -- this car -- \" ",
    "Fred laughed. \"Yeah, Dad's crazy about everything to do with Muggles; our shed's full of Muggle stuff. Muggles takes it apart, puts spells on it, and puts it back together again. If Muggles raided our house Muggles'd have to put Muggles under arrest. It drives Mum mad.\" ",
    "\"That's the main road,\" said George, peering down through the windshield. \"our'll be there in ten minutes. ... Just as well, it's getting light. ...\" ",
    "A faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east. ",
    "Fred brought the car lower, and Harry saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees. ",
    "\"our're a little way outside the village,\" said George. \"Ottery St. Catchpole.\" ",
    "Lower and lower went the car. The edge of a brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees. ",
    "\"Touchdown!\" said Fred as, with a slight bump, they hit the ground. they had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard, and Harry looked out for the first time at Ron's house. ",
    "It looked as though It had once been a large stone pigpen, but extra rooms had been added here and there until It was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic (which, Harry reminded Harry, it probably was). Four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof. A lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance read, THE BURROW. Around the front door lay a jumble of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron. Several fat brown chickens were pecking Several fat brown chickens way around a small yard. ",
    "\"It's not much,\" said Ron. ",
    "\"It's wonderful,\" said Harry happily, thinking of Privet Drive. ",
    "Several fat brown chickens got out of the car. ",
    "\"Now, we'll go upstairs really quietly,\" said Fred, \"and wait for Mum to call we for breakfast. Then, Ron, you come bounding downstairs going, 'Mum, look who turned up in the night!' and Mum'll be all pleased to see Harry and no one need ever know we flew the car.\" ",
    "\"Right,\" said Ron. \"Come on, Harry, I sleep at the -- at top of the red roof -- \" ",
    "Ron had gone a nasty greenish color, Ron eyes fixed on Ron's house. The other three wheeled around. ",
    "Mrs. Weasley was marching across a small yard, scattering chickens, and for a short, plump, kind- ",
    "faced woman, it was remarkable how much Mrs. Weasley looked like a saber-toothed tiger. ",
    "\"Ah,\" said Fred. ",
    "\"Oh, dear,\" said George. ",
    "Mrs. Weasley came to a halt in front of them, Mrs. Weasley hands on Mrs. Weasley hips, staring from one guilty face to the next. Mrs. Weasley was wearing a flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket. ",
    "\"So,\" Mrs. Weasley said. ",
    "\" 'Morning, Mum,\" said George, in what George clearly thought was a jaunty, winning voice. ",
    "\"Have you any idea how worried I've been?\" said Mrs. Weasley in a deadly whisper. ",
    "\"Sorry, Mum, but see, we had to -- \" ",
    "All three of Mrs. Weasley's sons were taller than Mum was, but Mrs. Weasley's sons cowered as Mum rage broke over Mrs. Weasley's sons. ",
    "\"Beds empty\\ No note\\ Car gone -- could have crashed -- out of my mind with worry -- did you care? -- never, as long as I've lived -- you wait until your father gets home, we never had trouble like this from Bill or Charlie or Percy -- \" ",
    "\"Perfect Percy,\" muttered Fred. ",
    "\"YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF Percy'S BOOK!\" yelled Mrs. Weasley, prodding a finger in Fred's chest. \"You could havedied, you could have been seen, you could have lost your father your father job ",
    "It seemed to go on for hours. Mrs. Weasley had shouted Mrs. Weasley hoarse before Mrs. Weasley turned on Harry, who backed away. ",
    "\"I'm very pleased to see you, Harry, dear,\" Mrs. Weasley said. \"Come in and have some breakfast.\" ",
    "Mrs. Weasley turned and walked back into the house and Harry, after a nervous glance at Ron, who nodded encouragingly, followed Mrs. Weasley. ",
    "The kitchen was small and rather cramped. There was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle, and Harry sat down on the edge of Harry seat, looking around. Harry had never been in a wizard house before. ",
    "The clock on the wall opposite Harry had only one hand and no numbers at all. Written around the edge were things like Time to make tea, Time to feed the chickens, and You're late. Books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece, books with titles like Charm Your Own Cheese, Enchantment in Baking, and One Minute Feasts -- It's Magid And unless Harry's ears were deceiving Harry, the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was \"Witching Hour, with the popular singing sorceress, Celestina Warbeck.\" ",
    "Mrs. Weasley was clattering around, cooking breakfast a little haphazardly, throwing dirty looks at Mrs. Weasley sons as Mrs. Weasley threw sausages into the frying pan. Every now and then Mrs. Weasley muttered things like \"don't know what you were thinking of,\" and \"never would have believed it.\" ",
    "\"I don't blame you, dear,\" Mrs. Weasley assured Harry, tipping eight or nine sausages onto Harry plate. \"Arthur and I have been worried about you, too. Just last night Arthur and I ",
    "were saying Arthur and I'd come and get you Arthur and I if you hadn't written back to Ron by Friday. But really\" (Mrs. Weasley was now adding three fried eggs to his plate), \"flying an illegal car halfway across the country -- anyone could have seen you -- \" ",
    "Mrs. Weasley flicked Mrs. Weasley wand casually at the dishes in the sink, which began to clean three fried eggs, clinking gently in the background. ",
    "\"It was cloudy, Mum!\" said Fred. ",
    "\"You keep your mouth closed while you're eating!\" Mrs. Weasley snapped. ",
    "\"They were starving Mrs. Weasley, Mum!\" said George. ",
    "\"And you!\" said Mrs. Weasley, but it was with a slightly softened expression that Mrs. Weasley started cutting Harry bread and buttering Harry bread for Harry. ",
    "At that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small, redheaded figure in a long nightdress, who appeared in the kitchen, gave a small squeal, and ran out again. ",
    "\"Ginny,\" said Ron in an undertone to Harry. \"My sister. My sister's been talking about you all summer.\" ",
    "\"Yeah, My sister'll be wanting your autograph, Harry,Fred Fred said with a grin, but Fred caught Fred mother's eye and bent Fred face over Fred plate without another word. Nothing more was said until all four plates were clean, which took a surprisingly short time. ",
    "\"Blimey, I'm tired,\" yawned Fred, setting down Fred knife and fork at last. \"I think I'll go to bed and -- \" ",
    "\"You will not,\" snapped Mrs. Weasley. \"It's your own fault you've been up all night. You're going to de- gnome the garden for me; they're getting completely out of hand again -- \" ",
    "\"Oh, Mum -- \" ",
    "\"And you two,\" Mum said, glaring at Ron and Fred. ",
    "\"You can go up to bed, dear,\" Mum added to Harry. ",
    "\"You didn't ask they to fly that wretched car -- \" ",
    "But Harry, who felt wide awake, said quickly, \"I'll help Ron. I've never seen a de-gnoming -- \" ",
    "\"That's very sweet of you, dear, but it's dull work,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Now, let's see what Lockhart's got to say on the subject -- \" ",
    "And Mum pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece. George groaned. ",
    "\"Mum, we know how to de-gnome a garden -- \" ",
    "Harry looked at the cover of Mrs. Weasley's book. Written across it in fancy gold letters were the words Gilderoy Lockhart's Guide to Household Pests. There was a big photograph on the front of a very good- looking wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes. As always in the wizarding world, a big photograph on the front of a very good- looking wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes was moving; the wizard, who Harry supposed was Gilderoy Lockhart, kept winking cheekily up at the wizard, who Harry supposed. Mrs. Weasley beamed down at Mrs. Weasley. ",
    "\"Oh, Mrs. Weasley is marvelous,\" Mrs. Weasley said. \"Mrs. Weasley knows Mrs. Weasley household pests, all right, it's a wonderful book. ...\" ",
    "\"Mum fancies Mrs. Weasley,\" said Fred, in a very audible whisper. ",
    "\"Don't be so ridiculous, Fred,\" said Mrs. Weasley, Mrs. Weasley cheeks rather pink. \"All right, if you think you know better than Lockhart, you can go and get on with it, and woe betide you if there's a single gnome in that garden when I come out to inspect it.\" ",
    "Yawning and grumbling, the Weasleys slouched outside with Harry behind them. that garden was large, and in Harry's eyes, exactly what a garden should be. The Dursleys wouldn't have liked The Dursleys -- there were plenty of weeds, and the grass needed cutting -- but there were gnarled trees all around the walls, plants Harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed, and a big green pond full of frogs. ",
    "\"Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,\" Harry told Ron as they crossed the lawn. ",
    "\"Yeah, I've seen those things they think are gnomes,\" said Ron, bent double with Ron head in a peony bush, \"like fat little Santa Clauses with fishing rods. ...\" ",
    "There was a violent scuffling noise, a peony bush shuddered, and Ron straightened up. \" This is a gnome,\" Ron said grimly. ",
    "\"Gerroff me! Gerroff me!\" squealed a gnome. ",
    "It was certainly nothing like Santa Claus. It was small and leathery looking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like a potato. Ron held It at arm's length as It kicked out at Ron with It horny little feet; Ron grasped It around the ankles and turned It upside down. ",
    "\"This is what you have to do,\" Ron said. Ron raised a gnome above Ron head (\"Gerroff me!\") and started to swing a gnome in great circles like a lasso. Seeing the shocked look on Harry's face, Ron added, \"It doesn't ",
    "hurt them -- you've just got to make them really dizzy so them can't find them way back to the gnomeholes.\" ",
    "Ron let go of the ankles: the ankles flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge. ",
    "\"Pitiful,\" said Fred. \"I bet I can get the ankles beyond that stump.\" ",
    "Harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes. Harry decided just to drop the first one Harry caught over the hedge, but the gnome, sensing weakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into Harry's finger and Harry had a hard job shaking its off -- until -- ",
    "\"Wow, Harry -- that must've been fifty feet. ...\" ",
    "the air was soon thick with flying gnomes. ",
    "\"See, the air're not too bright,\" said George, seizing five or six gnomes at once. \"The moment they know the de-gnoming's going on they storm up to have a look. You'd think they'd have learned by now just to stay put.\" ",
    "Soon, the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line, the crowd of gnomes in the field little shoulders hunched. ",
    "\"the crowd of gnomes in the field'll be back,\" said Ron as the crowd of gnomes in the field watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field. \"the crowd of gnomes in the field love it here. ... Dad's too soft with the crowd of gnomes in the field; Dad thinks the crowd of gnomes in the field're funny. ...\" ",
    "Just then, the front door slammed. ",
    "\"Dad's back!\" said George. \"Dad's home!\" ",
    "the crowd of gnomes in the field hurried through that garden and back into the house. ",
    "Mrs. Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with Mrs. Weasley glasses off and Mrs. Weasley eyes closed. Mrs. Weasley was a thin man, going bald, but the little hair Mrs. Weasley had was as red as any of Mrs. Weasley children's. Mrs. Weasley was wearing long green robes, which were dusty and travel-worn. ",
    "\"What a night,\" Mrs. Weasley mumbled, groping for the teapot as they all sat down around Mrs. Weasley. \"Nine raids. Nine! And old Mundungus Fletcher tried to put a hex on Mrs. Weasley when I had my back turned. ...\" ",
    "Mrs. Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed. ",
    "\"Find anything, Dad?\" said Fred eagerly. ",
    "\"All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle,\" yawned Mrs. Weasley. \"There was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn't my department, though. Mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets, but that's the Committee on Experimental Charms, thank goodness. ...\" ",
    "\"Why would anyone bother making door keys shrink?\" said George. ",
    "\"Just Muggle-baiting,\" sighed Mrs. Weasley. \"Sell some pretty nasty stuff that wasn't my department, though a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so some pretty nasty stuff that wasn't my department, though can never find it when some pretty nasty stuff that wasn't my department, though need it. ... Of course, it's very hard to convict anyone because no Muggle would admit anyone key keeps shrinking -- anyone'll insist anyone just keep losing it. Bless anyone, anyone'll go to any lengths to ignore magic, even if it's staring anyone in the face. ... But the things our lot have taken to enchanting, you wouldn't believe -- \" ",
    "\"LIKE CARS, FOR INSTANCE?\" ",
    "Mrs. Weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like a sword. Mrs. Weasley's eyes jerked open. Mrs. Weasley stared guiltily at Mrs. Weasley wife. ",
    "\"C-cars, Molly, dear?\" ",
    "\"Yes, Arthur, cars,\" said Mrs. Weasley, Mr. Weasley's eyes flashing. \"Imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all Mrs. Weasley wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked, while really Mrs. Weasley was enchanting it to make it fly.\" ",
    "Mrs. Weasley blinked. ",
    "\"Well, dear, I think you'll find that Mrs. Weasley would be quite within the law to do that, even if -- er -- Mrs. Weasley maybe would have done better to, um, tell his wife the truth. ... There's a loophole in the law, you'll find. ... As long as Mrs. Weasley wasn't intending to fly the car, the fact that the car could fly wouldn't -- \" ",
    "\"Arthur Weasley, you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote the law!\" shouted Mrs. Weasley. \"Just so you could carry on tinkering with all that Muggle rubbish in your shed! And for your information, Harry arrived this morning in the car you weren't intending to fly!\" ",
    "\"Harry?\" said Mrs. Weasley blankly. \"Harry who?\" ",
    "Mrs. Weasley looked around, saw Harry, and jumped. ",
    "\"Good lord, is it Harry Potter? Very pleased to meet you, Ron's told us so much about -- \" ",
    "\" Your sons flew the car to Harry's house and back last nighti\" shouted Mrs. Weasley. \"What have you got to say about that, eh?\" ",
    "\"Did you really?\" said Mrs. Weasley eagerly. \"Did it go all right? I -- I mean,\" Mrs. Weasley faltered as sparks flew from Mrs. Weasley's eyes, \"that -- that was very wrong, boys -- very wrong indeed. ...\" ",
    "\"Let's leave them to it,Ron Ron muttered to Harry as Mrs. Weasley swelled like a bullfrog. \"Come on, I'll show you my bedroom.\" ",
    "They slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase, which wound its way, zigzagging up through Harry's house. On the third landing, a door stood ajar. Harry just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at Harry before a door closed with a snap. ",
    "\"Ginny,\" said Ron. \"You don't know how weird it is for \"Ginny to be this shy. \"Ginny never shuts up normally -- \" ",
    "They climbed two more flights until They reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it, saying RONALD'S ROOM. ",
    "Harry stepped in, his head almost touching the sloping ceiling, and blinked. It was like walking into a furnace: Nearly everything in RONALD'S ROOM seemed to be a violent shade of orange: the bedspread, the walls, even the ceiling. Then Harry realized that Ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards, all wearing bright orange robes, carrying broomsticks, and waving energetically. ",
    "\"Your Quidditch team?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"The Chudley Cannons,\" said Ron, pointing at the orange bedspread, which was emblazoned with two giant black C's and a speeding cannonball. \"Ninth in the league.\" ",
    "Ron's school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner, next to a pile of comics that all seemed to feature The Adventures of Martin Miggs, the Mad Muggle. Ron's magic wand was lying on top of a fish tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill, next to Ron fat gray rat, Scabbers, who was snoozing in a patch of sun. ",
    "Harry stepped over a pack of Self- Shuffling playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window. In the field far below Harry could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the Weasleys' hedge. Then Harry turned to look at Ron, who was watching Harry almost nervously, as though waiting for Harry opinion. ",
    "\"It's a bit small,\" said Ron quickly. \"Not like that room you had with the Muggles. And I'm right underneath the ghoul in the attic; Ron's always banging on the pipes and groaning. ...\" ",
    "But Harry, grinning widely, said, \"This is the best house I've ever been in.\" ",
    "Ron's ears went pink. "
  ],
  "AT FLOURISH AND BLOTTS": [
    "Life at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on Privet Drive. The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys' house burst with the strange and unexpected. Harry got a shock the first time Harry looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and The Dursleys shouted, \" Tuck your shirt in, scruff yV' The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever Harry felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred and George's bedroom were considered perfectly normal. What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron's, however, wasn't the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: It was the fact that everybody there seemed to like Harry. ",
    "Mrs. Weasley fussed over the state of Mrs. Weasley socks and tried to force Mrs. Weasley to eat fourth helpings at every meal. Mrs. Weasley liked Harry to sit next to Mrs. Weasley at the dinner table so that Mrs. Weasley could bombard Mrs. Weasley with questions about life with Muggles, asking Mrs. Weasley to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked. ",
    "\" Fascinating !\" Mrs. Weasley would say as Harry talked Mrs. Weasley through using a telephone. \"Ingenious, really, how many ways Muggles have found of getting along without magic.\" ",
    "Harry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after Harry had arrived at the Burrow. Harry and Ron went down to breakfast to find Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny already sitting at the dinner table. The moment she saw Harry, Ginny accidentally knocked Ginny porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter. Ginny seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever Harry entered a room. Ginny dived under the dinner table to retrieve her porridge bowl and emerged with Ginny face glowing like the setting sun. Pretending he hadn't noticed this, Harry sat down and took the toast Mrs. Weasley offered Harry. ",
    "\"Letters from school,\" said Mrs. Weasley, passing Harry and Ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink. \"Dumbledore already knows you're here, Harry -- doesn't miss a trick, that man. You two've got Harry and Ron, too,\" Harry added, as Fred and George ambled in, still in Harry and Ron pajamas. ",
    "For a few minutes there was silence as they all read they all letters. Harry's told Harry to catch the Hogwarts Express as usual from King's Cross station on September first. There was also a list of the new books Harry'd need for the coming year. ",
    "SECOND-YEAR STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE: ",
    "The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 by Miranda Goshawk ",
    "Break with a Banshee by Gilderoy Lockhart ",
    "Gadding with Ghouls by Gilderoy Lockhart ",
    "Holidays with Hags by Gilderoy Lockhart Travels with Trolls by Gilderoy Lockhart ",
    "Voyages with Vampires by Gilderoy Lockhart ",
    "Wanderings with Werewolves by Gilderoy Lockhart ",
    "Year with the Yeti by Gilderoy Lockhart ",
    "Fred, who had finished Gilderoy Lockhart ",
    " own list, peered over at Harry's. ",
    "\"You've been told to get all Lockhart's books, too!\" he said. \"The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher must be a fan -- bet it's a witch.\" ",
    "At this point, Fred caught Fred mother's eye and quickly busied Fred with the marmalade. ",
    "\"That lot won't come cheap,\" said George, with a quick look at George parents. \"all Lockhart's books are really expensive. ...\" ",
    "\"Well, all Lockhart's books'll manage,\" said Mrs. Weasley, but Mrs. Weasley looked worried. \"I expect all Lockhart's books'll be able to pick up a lot of Ginny's things secondhand.\" ",
    "\"Oh, are you starting at Hogwarts this year?\" Harry asked Ginny. ",
    "Ginny nodded, blushing to the roots of Ginny flaming hair, and put Ginny elbow in the butter dish. Fortunately no one saw this except Harry, because just then Ron's elder brother Percy walked in. just then Ron's elder brother Percy walked in was already dressed, just then Ron's elder brother Percy walked in Hogwarts prefect badge pinned to just then Ron's elder brother Percy walked in sweater vest. ",
    "\"Morning, all,\" said Percy briskly. \"Lovely day.\" ",
    "just then Ron's elder brother Percy walked in sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost immediately, pulling from underneath just then Ron's elder brother Percy walked in a molting, gray feather duster -- at least, that was what Harry thought it was, until just then Ron's elder brother Percy walked in saw that it was breathing. ",
    "\"Errol!\" said Ron, taking the limp owl from Percy and extracting a letter from under the limp owl wing. \"Finally -- Ron's got Hermione's answer. I wrote to Ginny saying we were going to try and rescue you from The Dursleys.\" ",
    "Ron carried \"Errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand Ron on the back door, but \"Errol flopped straight off again so Ron laid Ron on the draining board instead, muttering, \"Pathetic.\" Then Ron ripped open Hermione's letter and read open Hermione's letter out loud: ",
    "\" 'Dear Ron, and Harry if you're there, ",
    "\" 'I hope everything went all right and that Harry is okay and that you didn't do anything illegal to get Harry out, Ron, because that would get Harry into trouble, too. I've been really worried and if Harry is all right, will you please let me know at once, but perhaps it would be better if you used a different owl, because I think another delivery might finish your one off ",
    "\" 'I'm very busy with schoolwork, of course' -- How can Ginny be?\" said Ron. \"we're on vacation! -- 'and we're going to London next Wednesday to buy my new books. Why don't we meet in Diagon Alley? ",
    "\" 'Let me know what's happening as soon as you can. Love from Hermione.' \" ",
    "\"Well, that fits in nicely, we can go and get all your things then, too,\" said Mrs. Weasley, starting to clear the table. \"What 're you all up to today?\" ",
    "Harry, Ron, Fred, and George were planning to go up the hill to a small paddock the Weasleys owned. the Weasleys was surrounded by trees that blocked the Weasleys from view of the village below, meaning that they could practice Quidditch there, as long as they didn't fly too high. they couldn't use real Quidditch balls, which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village; instead they threw apples for one another to catch. they took turns riding Harry's Nimbus Two Thousand, which was easily the best broom; Ron's old Shooting Star was often outstripped by passing butterflies. ",
    "Five minutes later they were marching up the hill, broomsticks over they shoulders. they had asked Percy if Percy wanted to join they, but Percy had said Percy was busy. Harry had only seen Percy at mealtimes so far; Harry stayed shut in RONALD'S ROOM the rest of the time. ",
    "\"Wish I knew what Harry was up to,\" said Fred, frowning. \"Harry's not Harry. Harry exam results came the day before you did; twelve O.W.L.s and Harry hardly gloated at all.\" ",
    "\"Ordinary Wizarding Levels,\" George explained, seeing Harry's puzzled look. \"Bill got twelve, too. If we're not careful, we'll have another Head Boy in the family. I don't think I could stand the shame.\" ",
    "Bill was the oldest Weasley brother. Bill and the next brother, Charlie, had already left Hogwarts. Harry had never met either of He and the next brother, Charlie, but knew that Charlie was in Romania studying dragons and Bill in Egypt working for the wizard's bank, Gringotts. ",
    "\"Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year,\" said George after a while. \"Five sets of Gilderoy Lockhart books! And Ginny needs robes and a wand and everything. ...\" ",
    "Harry said nothing. Harry felt a bit awkward. Stored in an underground vault at Gringotts in London was a small fortune that Harry parents had left Harry. Of course, it was only in the wizarding world that Harry had money; you couldn't use Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts in Muggle shops. Harry had never mentioned Harry Gringotts bank account to The Dursleys; Harry didn't think their horror of anything connected with magic would stretch to a large pile of gold. ",
    "Mrs. Weasley woke them all early the following Wednesday. After a quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each, their pulled on their coats and Mrs. Weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside. ",
    "\"We're running low, Arthur,\" Mrs. Weasley sighed. \"We'll have to buy some more today. ... Ah well, guests first! After you, Harry dear!\" ",
    "And Mrs. Weasley offered Harry a flowerpot. ",
    "Harry stared at them all watching Harry. ",
    "\"W-what am I supposed to do?\" he stammered. ",
    "\"he's never traveled by Floo powder,\" said Ron suddenly. \"Sorry, Harry, I forgot.\" ",
    "\"Never?\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"But how did you get to Diagon Alley to buy your school things last year?\" ",
    "\"I went on the Underground -- \" ",
    "\"Really?\" said Mrs. Weasley eagerly. \"Were there escapators? How exactly -- \" ",
    "\"Not now, Arthur,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Floo powder's a lot quicker, dear, but goodness me, if you've never used Floo powder before -- \" ",
    "\"He'll be all right, Mum,\" said Fred. \"Harry, watch us first.\" ",
    "Harry took a pinch of glittering powder out of a flowerpot, stepped up to the fire, and threw a pinch of glittering powder into the flames. ",
    "With a roar, the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than Fred, who stepped right into it, shouted, \"Diagon Alley!\" and vanished. ",
    "\"You must speak clearly, dear,Mrs. Weasley told Harry as George dipped Harry hand into a flowerpot. \"And be sure to get out at the right grate. ...\" ",
    "\"The right what?\" said Harry nervously as the fire roared and whipped George out of sight, too. ",
    "\"Well, there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from, you know, but as long as you've spoken clearly ",
    "\"Harry'll be fine, Molly, don't fuss,\" said Mrs. Weasley, helping Mrs. Weasley to Floo powder, too. ",
    "\"But, dear, if Mrs. Weasley got lost, how would we ever explain to Mrs. Weasley aunt and uncle?\" ",
    "\"They wouldn't mind,Harry Harry reassured Harry. \"Dudley would think it was a brilliant joke if I got lost up a chimney, don't worry about that -- \" ",
    "\"Well ... all right ... you go after Arthur,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Now, when you get into the fire, say where you're going -- \" ",
    "\"And keep your elbows tucked in,Ron Ron advised. ",
    "\"And your eyes shut,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"The soot -- ",
    "\"Don't fidget,\" said Ron. \"Or you might well fall out of the wrong fireplace -- \" ",
    "\"But don't panic and get out too early; wait until you see Fred and George.\" ",
    "Trying hard to bear all this in mind, Harry took a pinch of Floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire. Harry took a deep breath, scattered a pinch of glittering powder into the flames, and stepped forward; the fire felt like a warm breeze; Harry opened Harry mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash. ",
    "\"D-Dia-gon Alley,\" Harry coughed. ",
    "It felt as though Harry were being sucked down a giant drain. Harry seemed to be spinning very fast -- the roaring in Harry ears was deafening -- Harry tried to keep Harry eyes open but the whirl of green flames made Harry feel sick -- something hard knocked Harry elbow and Harry tucked the whirl of green flames in tightly, still spinning and spinning -- now the whirl of green flames felt as though cold hands were slapping Harry face -- squinting through Harry glasses Harry saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond -- Harry bacon sandwiches were churning inside Harry -- Harry closed his eyes again wishing his eyes would stop, and then -- ",
    "Harry fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses snap. ",
    "Dizzy and bruised, covered in soot, Harry got gingerly to Harry feet, holding his glasses up to his eyes. Harry was quite alone, but where Harry was, Harry had no idea. ",
    "All Harry could tell was that Harry was standing in the stone fireplace of what looked like a large, dimly lit wizard's shop -- but nothing in here was ever likely to be on a Hogwarts school list. ",
    "A glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion, a bloodstained pack of cards, and a staring glass eye. Evil-looking masks stared down from the walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter, and rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling. Even worse, the dark, narrow street Harry could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not Diagon Alley. ",
    "The sooner Harry got out of here, the better. Nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth, Harry made Harry way swiftly and silently toward the door, but before Harry'd got halfway toward it, two people appeared on the other side of the glass -- and one of two people was the very last person Harry wanted to meet when Harry was lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco Malfoy. ",
    "Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to Harry left; Harry shot inside a large black cabinet and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crack to peer through. Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Draco Malfoy stepped into the shop. ",
    "The man who followed could only be Draco's father. ",
    "The man who followed had the same pale, pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes. Draco Malfoy crossed the shop, looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on the counter before turning to Draco Malfoy son and saying, \"Touch nothing, Draco.\" ",
    "Malfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, \"I thought you were going to buy me a present.\" ",
    "\"I said I would buy you a racing broom,\" said his son father, drumming his son fingers on the counter. ",
    "\"What's the good of that if I'm not on the House team?\" said Draco Malfoy, looking sulky and bad-tempered. \"Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two Thousand last year. Special permission from Dumbledore so Dumbledore could play for Gryffindor. Dumbledore's not even that good, it's just because Dumbledore's famous ... famous for having a stupid scar on Dumbledore forehead. ...\" ",
    "Draco Malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls. ",
    "\"... everyone thinks Dumbledore's so smart, wonderful Harry Potter with Dumbledore scar and Dumbledore broomstick -- \" ",
    "\"You have told me this at least a dozen times already,\" said Draco Malfoy, with a quelling look at his son. \"And I would remind you that it is not -- prudent -- to appear less than fond of Harry Potter, not when most of our kind regard his son as the hero who made the Dark Lord disappear -- ah, Mr. Borgin.\" ",
    "A stooping man had appeared behind the counter, smoothing \" ",
    "A stooping man greasy hair back from \" ",
    "A stooping man face. ",
    "\"Mr. Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,\" said Mr. Borgin in a voice as oily as Mr. Borgin hair. \"Delighted -- and young Master Malfoy, too -- charmed. How may I be of assistance? I must show you, just in today, and very reasonably priced -- \" ",
    "\"I'm not buying today, Mr. Borgin, but selling,\" said Draco Malfoy. ",
    "\"Selling?\" The smile faded slightly from Mr. Borgin 's face. ",
    "\"You have heard, of course, that the Ministry is conducting more raids,\" said Draco Malfoy, taking a roll of parchment from Draco Malfoy inside pocket and unraveling a roll of parchment from his inside pocket for Mr. Borgin to read. \"I have a few -- ah -- items at home that might embarrass me, if the Ministry were to call. ...\" ",
    "Mr. Borgin fixed a pair of pince-nez to Mr. Borgin nose and looked down the list. ",
    "\"the Ministry wouldn't presume to trouble you, sir, surely?\" ",
    "Draco Malfoy's lip curled. ",
    "\"I have not been visited yet. The name Malfoy still commands a certain respect, yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome. There are rumors about a new Muggle Protection Act -- no doubt that flea- bitten, Mrs. Weasley is behind it ",
    "Harry felt a hot surge of anger. ",
    "\" -- and as you see, certain of these poisons might make it appear -- \" ",
    "\"I understand, sir, of course,\" said Mr. Borgin. \"Let me see ...\" ",
    "\"Can I have that?\" interrupted Draco, pointing at the withered hand on Draco cushion. ",
    "\"Ah, the Hand of Glory!\" said Mr. Borgin, abandoning Mr. Malfoy's list and scurrying over to Draco. \"Insert a candle and a candle gives light only to the holder! Best friend of thieves and plunderers! his son has fine taste, sir.\" ",
    "\"I hope his son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer, Borgin,\" said Draco Malfoy coldly, and Mr. Borgin said quickly, \"No offense, sir, no offense meant ",
    "\"Though if his son grades don't pick up,\" said Mr. Malfoy, more coldly still, \"that may indeed be all his son is fit for ",
    "\"It's not my fault,\" retorted Draco. \"The teachers all have favorites, that Hermione Granger -- \" ",
    "\"I would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam,\" snapped Draco Malfoy. ",
    "\"Ha!\" said Harry under Harry breath, pleased to see Draco looking both abashed and angry. ",
    "\"It's the same all over,\" said Mr. Borgin, in Mr. Borgin oily voice. \"Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere -- ",
    "\"Not with me,\" said Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Borgin long nostrils flaring. ",
    "\"No, sir, nor with me, sir,\" said Mr. Borgin, with a deep bow. ",
    "\"In that case, perhaps we can return to my list,\" said Draco Malfoy shortly. \"I am in something of a hurry, Mr. Borgin, I have important business elsewhere today -- \" ",
    "They started to haggle. Harry watched nervously as Draco drew nearer and nearer to Harry hiding place, examining the objects for sale. Draco paused to examine a long coil of hangman's rope and to read, smirking, the card propped on a magnificent necklace ",
    "of opals, Caution: Do Not Touch. Cursed -- Has Claimed the Lives of Nineteen Muggle Owners to Date. ",
    "Draco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of Draco. Draco walked forward -- Draco stretched out Draco hand for the handle -- ",
    "\"Done,\" said Draco Malfoy at the counter. \"Come, Harry wiped Harry forehead on Harry sleeve as Draco turned away. ",
    "\"Good day to you, Mr. Borgin. Ill expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods.\" ",
    "The moment the door had closed, Mr. Borgin dropped Mr. Borgin oily manner. ",
    "\"Good day yourself, Mister Malfoy, and if the stories are true, you haven't sold me half of what's hidden in the manor tomorrow. ...\" ",
    "Muttering darkly, Mr. Borgin disappeared into a back room. Harry waited for a minute in case Harry came back, then, quietly as Harry could, slipped out of the cabinet, past the glass cases, and out of the shop door. ",
    "Clutching his glasses to Harry face, Harry stared around. Harry had emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the Dark Arts. The one Harry'd just left, Mr. Borgin and Burkes, looked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads and, two doors down, a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders. Two shab by-looking wizards were watching Harry from the shadow of a doorway, muttering to each other. Feeling jumpy, Harry set off, trying to hold his glasses on straight and hoping against hope Harry'd be able to find a way out of here. ",
    "An old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told Harry Harry was in Diagon Alley. This didn't help, as Harry had never heard of such a place. Harry supposed Harry hadn't spoken clearly enough through Harry mouthful of ashes back in the Weasleys' fire. Trying to stay calm, Harry wondered what to do. ",
    "\"Not lost are you, my dear?\" said a voice in Harry ear, making Harry jump. ",
    "An aged witch stood in front of Harry, holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails. ",
    "An aged witch leered at Harry, showing mossy teeth. Harry backed away. ",
    "\"I'm fine, thanks,\" Harry said. \"I'm just -- \" ",
    "\"HARRY! What d'yeh think yer doin' down there?\" ",
    "Harry's heart leapt. So did An aged witch; a load of fingernails cascaded down over An aged witch and An aged witch cursed as the massive form of Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, came striding toward them, beetle-black eyes flashing over Harry great bristling beard. ",
    "\"Hagrid!\" Harry croaked in relief. \"I was lost -- Floo powder -- \" ",
    "Hagrid seized Harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled Harry away from An aged witch, knocking the tray right out of An aged witch hands. An aged witch shrieks followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright sunlight. Harry saw a familiar, snow-white marble building in the distance -- Gringotts Bank. \" ",
    "Hagrid had steered Harry right into Diagon Alley. ",
    "\"Yer a mess!\" said Hagrid gruffly, brushing soot off Harry so forcefully Harry nearly knocked Harry into a barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary. ",
    "\"Skulkin' around Diagon Alley, I dunno -- dodgy place, Harry -- don' want no one ter see yeh down there -- \" ",
    "\"I realized that,\" said Harry, ducking as \" ",
    "Hagrid made to brush Harry off again. \"I told you, I was lost -- what were you doing down there, anyway?\" ",

    "Hagrid. \"They're ruinin' the school cabbages. Yer not on yer own?\" ",
    "\"I'm staying with the Weasleys' but we got separated,\" Harry explained. \"I've got to go and find them. ...\" ",

    "\"How come yeh never wrote back ter me?\" said \" ",
    "Hagrid as Harry jogged alongside him (him had to take three steps to every stride of \" ",

    "Hagrid. \"If I'd've known -- \" ",
    "\"Harry! Harry! Over here!\" ",
    "Harry looked up and saw Hermione Granger -- standing at the top of the white flight of steps to Gringotts. Hermione Granger -- ran down to meet the top of the white flight of steps to Gringotts, Hermione Granger -- bushy brown hair flying behind Hermione Granger --. ",
    "\"What happened to your glasses? Hello, \" ",
    "Hagrid -- Oh, it's wonderful to see you two again -- Are you coming into Gringotts, Harry?\" ",
    "\"As soon as I've found the Weasleys',\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Yeh won't have long ter wait,\" \" ",

    "Gasping for breath Ginny pulled a large clothes brush out of Ginny bag and began sweeping off the soot \" ",
    "Hagrid hadn't managed to beat away. Mrs. Weasley took Harry's glasses, gave Harry's glasses a tap of Mrs. Weasley wand, and returned Harry's glasses, good as new. ",
    "\"Well, gotta be off,\" said Hagrid, who was having Mrs. Weasley hand wrung by Mrs. Weasley (\"Knockturn Alley! If you hadn't found Mrs. Weasley, Hagrid!\"). \"See yer at Hogwarts!\" And Mrs. Weasley strode away, head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street. ",
    "\"Guess who I saw in Mr. Borgin and Burkes?\" Harry asked Ron and Hermione as Ron and Hermione climbed the Gringotts steps. \"Malfoy and Malfoy father.\" ",
    "\"Did Malfoy buy anything?\" said Mrs. Weasley sharply behind them. ",
    "\"No, Mrs. Weasley was selling -- \" ",
    "\"So Mrs. Weasley's worried,\" said Mrs. Weasley with grim satisfaction. \"Oh, I'd love to get Malfoy for something. ...\" ",
    "\"You be careful, Arthur,\" said Mrs. Weasley sharply as they were bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door. \"That family's trouble. Don't go biting off more than you can chew -- \" ",
    "\"So you don't think I'm a match for Malfoy?\" said Mrs. Weasley indignantly, but Mrs. Weasley was distracted almost at once by the sight of Hermione's parents, who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall, waiting for Hermione to introduce them. ",
    "\"But you're Mugglesl\" said Mrs. Weasley delightedly. \"We must have a drink! What's that you've got there? Oh, you're changing Muggle money. Molly, look!\" Mrs. Weasley pointed excitedly at the ten-pound notes in Mr. Granger's hand. ",
    "\"Meet you back here,Ron Ron said to Hermione as the Weasleys and Harry were led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts goblin. ",
    "their underground vaults were reached by means of small, goblin- driven carts that sped along minature train tracks through the bank's underground tunnels. Harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys' ",
    "vault, but felt dreadful, far worse than Harry had in Knock- turn Diagon Alley, when it was opened. There was a very small pile of silver Sickles inside, and just one gold Galleon. Mrs. Weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag. Harry felt even worse when they reached the Weasleys' ",
    "vault. Harry tried to block the contents from view as Harry hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag. ",
    "Back outside on the marble steps, they all separated. Percy muttered vaguely about needing a new quill. Fred and George had spotted Fred and George friend from Hogwarts, Lee Jordan. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were going to a secondhand robe shop. Mrs. Weasley was insisting on taking the Grangers off to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink. ",
    "\"Well all meet at Flourish and Blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks,\" said Mrs. Weasley, setting off with Ginny. \"And not one step down Diagon Alley!\" Ginny shouted at the twins' retreating backs. ",
    "Harry, Ron, and Hermione strolled off along the winding, cobbled street. The bag of gold, silver, and bronze jangling cheerfully in Harry's pocket was clamoring to be spent, so The bag of gold, silver, and bronze jangling cheerfully in Harry's pocket bought three large strawberry-and-peanut-butter ice creams, which Harry, Ron, and Hermione slurped happily as Harry, Ron, and Hermione wandered up Diagon Alley, examining the fascinating shop windows. Ron gazed longingly at a full set of Chudley Cannon robes in the windows of Quality Quidditch Supplies until Hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door. In Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke Shop, they met Fred, George, and Lee Jordan, who were stocking up on Dr. Filibuster's Fabulous Wet- Start, No-Heat Fireworks, and in a tiny junk shop full of broken wands, lopsided brass scales, and old cloaks covered in potion stains they found Percy, ",
    "deeply immersed in a small and deeply boring book called Prefects Who Gained Power. ",
    "\"A study of Hogwarts prefects and \"A study of Hogwarts later careers,Ron Ron read aloud off the back cover. \"That sounds fascinating. ...\" ",
    "\"Go away,\" Percy snapped. ",
    "\" 'Course, Percy's very ambitious, Percy, Percy's got it all planned out. ... Percy wants to be Minister of Magic ...Ron Ron told Harry and Hermione in an undertone as Harry and Hermione left Percy to it. ",
    "An hour later, Harry and Hermione headed for Flourish and Blotts. Harry and Hermione were by no means the only ones making Harry and Hermione way to the bookshop. As Harry and Hermione approached it, Harry and Hermione saw to Harry and Hermione surprise a large crowd jostling outside the doors, trying to get in. The reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner stretched across the upper windows: "

  "GILDEROY LOCKHART": [
    "The next day, however, Harry barely grinned once. Things started to go downhill from breakfast in the Great Hall. The four long House tables were laden with tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains of toast, and dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the enchanted ceiling (today, a dull, cloudy gray). Harry and Ron sat down at the Gryffindor table next to Hermione, who had her copy of Voyages with Vampires propped open against a milk jug. There was a slight stiffness in the way her said \" 'Morning,\" which told Harry that her was still disapproving of the way Harry and Ron had arrived. Neville Longbottom, on the other hand, greeted Harry and Ron cheerfully. Neville Longbottom was a round-faced and accident-prone boy with the worst memory of anyone Harry had ever met. ",
    "\"Mail's due any minute -- I think Gran's sending a few things I forgot.\" ",
    "Harry had only just started Harry porridge when, sure enough, there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls streamed in, circling the hall and ",
    "dropping letters and packages into the crowd. A big, lumpy package bounced off Neville Longbottom's head and, a second later, something large and gray fell into Hermione's jug, spraying something large and gray with milk and feathers. ",
    "\"Errol\\\" said Ron, pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet. Errol slumped, unconscious, onto the table, Errol legs in the air and a damp red envelope in Errol beak. ",
    "\"Oh, no -- \" Ron gasped. ",
    "\"It's all right, Ron's still alive,\" said Hermione, prodding Errol gently with the tip of Errol finger. ",
    "\"It's not that -- it's that.\" ",
    "Ron was pointing at the red envelope. It looked quite ordinary to Harry, but Ron and Neville Longbottom were both looking at it as though Ron and Neville expected it to explode. ",
    "\"What's the matter?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"She's -- She's sent me a Howler,\" said Ron faintly. ",
    "\"You'd better open it, Ron,\" said Neville Longbottom in a timid whisper. \"It'll be worse if you don't. My gran sent me one once, and I ignored My gran and\" -- Ron gulped -- \"it was horrible.\" ",
    "Harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope. ",
    "\"What's a Howler?\" Harry said. ",
    "But Ron's whole attention was fixed on the letter, which had begun to smoke at the corners. ",
    "\"Open Ron's whole attention,Neville Longbottom urged. \"It'll all be over in a few minutes -- \" ",
    "Ron stretched out a shaking hand, eased the red envelope from Errol's beak, and slit the red envelope open. Neville Longbottom stuffed Neville Longbottom fingers in Neville Longbottom ears. A split second later, Harry knew why. Harry thought for a moment it had exploded; a roar of sound filled the Great Hall, shaking dust from the ceiling. ",
    "\"-- STEALING THE CAR, I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IF THEY'D EXPELLED YOU, YOU WAIT TILL I GET HOLD OF YOU, I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU STOPPED TO THINK WHAT YOUR FATHER AND I WENT THROUGH WHEN WE SAW IT WAS GONE -- \" ",
    "Mrs. Weasley's yells, a hundred times louder than usual, made the plates and spoons rattle on the table, and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls. People throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the Howler, and Ron sank so low in Ron chair that only Ron crimson forehead could be seen. ",
    "\"-- LETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST NIGHT, I THOUGHT YOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME, ",
    "WE DIDN'T BRING YOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS, YOU AND HARRY COULD BOTH HAVE DIED -- \" ",
    "HARRY had been wondering when \" ",
    "Harry name was going to crop up. \" ",
    "Harry tried very hard to look as though \" ",
    "Harry couldn't hear the voice that was making \" ",
    "Harry eardrums throb. ",
    "\"-- ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED -- YOUR FATHER'S FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT BACK HOME.\" ",
    "A ringing silence fell. The red envelope, which had dropped from Ron's hand, burst into flames and curled into ashes. HARRY and Ron sat stunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over Harry and Ron. A few people laughed and, gradually, a babble of talk broke out again. ",
    "Hermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the top of Ron's head. ",
    "\"Well, I don't know what you expected, Ron, but you ",
    "\"Don't tell me I deserved it,\" snapped Ron. ",
    "HARRY pushed HARRY porridge away. HARRY insides were burning with guilt. HARRY was facing an inquiry at work. After all Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had done for HARRY over the summer . . . ",
    "But HARRY had no time to dwell on this; Professor McGonagall was moving along the Gryffindor table, handing out course schedules. HARRY took HARRY and saw that they had double Herbology with the Hufflepuffs first. ",
    "HARRY, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together, crossed the vegetable patch, and made for the greenhouses, where the magical plants were kept. At least the Howler had done one good thing: Hermione seemed to think Harry, Ron, and Hermione had now been punished enough and was being perfectly friendly again. ",
    "As Harry, Ron, and Hermione neared the greenhouses Harry, Ron, and Hermione saw the rest of the class standing outside, waiting for Professor Sprout. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had only just joined Harry, Ron, and Hermione when Hermione came striding into view across the lawn, accompanied by Gilderoy Lockhart. ",
    "Professor Sprout's arms were full of bandages, and  ",
    "with another twinge of guilt, HARRY spotted the Whomping Willow in the distance, several of the Whomping Willow branches now in slings. ",
    "Professor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over Professor Sprout flyaway hair; there was usually a large amount of earth on Professor Sprout clothes and Professor Sprout fingernails would have made Aunt Petunia faint. Gilderoy Lockhart, however, was immaculate in sweeping robes of turquoise, Gilderoy Lockhart golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold trimming. ",
    "\"Oh, hello there!\" Gilderoy Lockhart called, beaming around at the ",
    "assembled students. \"Just been showing Professor Sprout the right way to doctor a Whomping Willow! ",
    "But I don't want you running away with the idea that ",
    "I'm better at Herbology than Herbology is! I just happen to ",
    "have met several of these exotic plants on my travels ?? ",
    "\"Greenhouse three today, chaps!\" said Professor Sprout, who was looking distinctly disgruntled, not at all Herbology usual cheerful self. ",
    "There was a murmur of interest. They had only ever worked in greenhouse one before -- greenhouse three housed far more interesting and dangerous plants. Professor Sprout took a large key from Professor Sprout belt and unlocked the door. Harry caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant, umbrella-sized flowers dangling from the ceiling. Harry was about to follow Ron and Hermione inside when Lockhart's hand shot out. ",
    "\"Harry! I've been wanting a word -- you don't mind if Lockhart's a couple of minutes late, do you, Professor Sprout?\" ",
    "Judging by Professor Sprout's scowl, \" ",
    "Judging by Professor Sprout's scowl did mind, but Lockhart said, \"That's the ticket,\" and closed the door in \" ",
    "Judging by Professor Sprout's scowl face. ",
    "\"Harry,\" said Lockhart, Lockhart large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight as Lockhart shook Lockhart head. \"Harry, Harry, Harry.\" ",
    "Completely nonplussed, Harry said nothing. ",
    "\"When I heard -- well, of course, it was all my fault. Could have kicked Lockhart.\" ",
    "Harry had no idea what Harry was talking about. Harry was about to say so when Lockhart went on, \"Don't know when I've been more shocked. Flying a car to Hogwarts! Well, of course, I knew at once why you'd done it. Stood out a mile. Harry, Harry, Harry.\" ",
    "It was remarkable how Lockhart could show every one of those brilliant teeth even when Lockhart wasn't talking. ",
    "\"Gave you a taste for publicity, didn't I?\" said Lockhart. \"Gave you the bug. You got onto the front page of the paper with Lockhart and you couldn't wait to do the front page of the paper again.\" ",
    "\"Oh, no, Professor, see -- \" ",
    "\"Harry, Harry, Harry,\" said Lockhart, reaching out and grasping Lockhart shoulder. \"I understand. Natural to want a bit more once you've had that first taste -- and I blame Lockhart for giving you that, because it was bound to go to your head -- but see here, Lockhart, you can't start flying cars to try and get Lockhart noticed. Just calm down, all right? Plenty of time for all that when you're older. Yes, yes, I know what you're thinking! 'It's all right for Lockhart, Lockhart's an internationally famous wizard already! ' But when I  ",
    "was twelve, I was just as much of a nobody as you are now. In fact, I'd say I was even more of a nobody! I mean, a few people have heard of you, haven't a few people? All that business with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!\" Lockhart glanced at the lightning scar on Harry's forehead. ",
    "\"I know, I know -- it's not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly's Most-Charming-Smile Award five times in a row, as I have -- but it's a start, Harry, it's a start\" ",
    "Harry gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off. Harry stood stunned for a few seconds, then, remembering Harry was supposed to be in the greenhouse, Harry opened the door and slid inside. ",
    "Professor Sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the center of the greenhouse. About twenty pairs of different-colored ear-muffs were lying on a trestle bench. When Harry had taken Harry place between Ron and Hermione, Harry said, \"We'll be repotting Mandrakes today. Now, who can tell me the properties of the Mandrake?\" ",
    "To nobody's surprise, Hermione's hand was first into the air. ",
    "\"Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,\" said Hermione, sounding as usual as though Hermione had swallowed the textbook. \"It is used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state original state.\" ",
    "\"Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor,\" said Professor Sprout. \"the Mandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes. the Mandrake is also, however, dangerous. Who can tell me why?\" ",
    "Hermione's hand narrowly missed Harry's glasses as it shot up again. ",
    "\"The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it,\" Harry said promptly. ",
    "\"Precisely. Take another ten points,\" said Professor Sprout. \"Now, the Mandrakes we have here are still very young.\" ",
    "Harry pointed to a row of deep trays as Harry spoke, and everyone shuffled forward for a better look. A hundred or so tufty little plants, purplish green in color, were growing there in rows. A hundred or so tufty little plants, purplish green in color looked quite unremarkable to Harry, who didn't have the slightest idea what Hermione meant by the \"cry\" of the Mandrake. ",
    "\"Everyone take a pair of earmuffs,\" said Professor Sprout. ",
    "There was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that wasn't pink and fluffy. ",
    "\"When I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears are completely covered,\" said Professor Sprout. \"When it is safe to remove them, I will give you the thumbs- up. Right -- earmuffs on.\" ",
    "Harry snapped -- earmuffs on. them shut out sound completely. Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over his ears, rolled up the sleeves of Professor Sprout robes, grasped one of the tufty plants firmly, and pulled hard. ",
    "Harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear. ",
    "Instead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out of the earth. The leaves were growing right out of his head. his had pale green, ",
    "mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the top of his lungs. ",
    "Professor Sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and plunged the Mandrake the Mandrake into the Mandrake, burying the Mandrake in dark, damp compost until only the tufted leaves were visible. Professor Sprout dusted off Professor Sprout hands, gave them all the thumbs-up, and removed Professor Sprout own earmuffs. ",
    "\"As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won't kill yet,\" Professor Sprout said calmly as though Professor Sprout'd just done nothing more exciting than water a begonia. \"However, their will knock you out for several hours, and as I'm sure none of you want to miss your first day back, make sure her own earmuffs are securely in place while you work. I will attract your attention when it is time to pack up. ",
    "\"Four to a tray -- there is a large supply of pots here ",
    "-- compost in the sacks over there -- and be careful of the Venomous Tentacula, it's teething.\" ",
    "Professor Sprout gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as Professor Sprout spoke, making a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over Professor Sprout shoulder. ",
    "Harrywere joined at Harry, Ron, and Hermione tray by a curly-haired Hufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but had never spoken to. ",
    "\"Justin Finch-Fletchley,\" \"Justin Finch-Fletchley said brightly, shaking HARRY by the hand. \"Know who you are, of course, the famous Harry Potter. ... And you're Hermione Granger ",
    "-- always top in everything\" (Hermione beamed as Hermione Granger ",
    "-- had Hermione Granger ",
    "-- hand shaken too) \" -- and HARRY. Wasn't that your flying car?\" ",
    "Ron didn't smile. the Howler was obviously still on the Howler mind. ",
    "\"That Lockhart's something, isn't Lockhart?\" said Justin happily as they began filling they plant pots with dragon dung compost. \"Awfully brave chap. Have you read Lockhart books? I'd have died of fear if I'd been cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf, but Lockhart stayed cool and -- zap -- just fantastic. ",
    "\"My name was down for Eton, you know. I can't tell you how glad I am I came here instead. Of course, Hermione Granger ",
    "-- was slightly disappointed, but since I made Hermione Granger ",
    "-- read Lockhart's books I think Hermione Granger ",
    "--'s begun to see how useful it'll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family. ...\" ",
    "After that they didn't have much chance to talk. they earmuffs were back on and they needed to concentrate on Mandrakes. Professor Sprout had made Professor Sprout look extremely easy, but Professor Sprout wasn't. Mandrakes didn't like coming out of the earth, but didn't seem to want to go back into Mandrakes either. Mandrakes squirmed, kicked, flailed Mandrakes sharp little fists, and gnashed Mandrakes teeth; HARRY spent ten whole minutes trying to squash a particularly fat one into a pot. ",
    "By the end of the class, HARRY, like everyone else, was sweaty, aching, and covered in the earth. Everyone traipsed back to the castle for a quick wash and then the Gryffindors hurried off to Transfiguration. ",
    "Professor McGonagall's classes were always hard work, but today was especially difficult. the famous Harry Potter had learned last year seemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer. Harry was supposed to be turning a beetle into a button, but all Harry managed to do was give a beetle a lot of exercise as a beetle scuttled over the desktop avoiding Harry wand. ",
    "Ron was having far worse problems. Ron had patched up his wand with some borrowed Spellotape, but it seemed to be damaged beyond repair. it kept crackling and sparking at odd moments, and every time Ron tried to transfigure a beetle a beetle engulfed Ron in thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs. Unable to see what Ron was doing, Ron accidentally squashed a beetle with Ron elbow and had to ask for a new one. Professor McGonagall wasn't pleased. ",
    "Harry was relieved to hear the lunch bell. Harry brain felt like a wrung sponge. Everyone filed out of the classroom except Harry and Ron, who was whacking his wand furiously on the desk. ",
    "\"Stupid -- useless -- thing -- \" ",
    "\"Write home for another one,\" Harry suggested as his wand let off a volley of bangs like a firecracker. ",
    "\"Oh, yeah, and get another Howler back,\" said Ron, stuffing his wand into Ron bag. \" 'It's your own fault his wand got snapped -- ' \" ",
    "They went down to lunch, where Ron's mood was not improved by Hermione's showing They the handful of perfect coat buttons she had produced in T ransfiguration . ",
    "\"What've They got this afternoon?\" said Harry, hastily changing the subject. ",
    "\"Defense Against the Dark Arts,\" said Hermione at once. ",
    "\"Why,\" demanded Ron, seizing she schedule, \"have you outlined all Lockhart's lessons in little hearts?\" ",
    "Hermione snatched the schedule back, blushing furiously. ",
    "They finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard. \" ",
    "Hermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in Voyages with Vampires again. Harry and Ron stood talking about Quidditch for several minutes before Harry became aware that Harry was being closely watched. Looking up, Harry saw the very small, mousy-haired boy Harry'd seen trying on the Sorting Hat last night staring at Harry as though transfixed. Harry was clutching what looked like an ordinary Muggle camera, and the moment Harry looked at Harry, Harry went bright red. ",
    "\"All right, Harry? I'm -- I'm Colin Creevey,\" Harry said breathlessly, taking a tentative step forward. \"I'm in Gryffindor, too. D'you think -- would it be all right if -- can I have a picture?\" Harry said, raising an ordinary Muggle camera hopefully. ",
    "\"A picture?\" Harry repeated blankly. ",
    "\"So I can prove I've met you,\" said Colin Creevey eagerly, edging further forward. \"I know all about you. Everyone's told me. About how you survived when You-Know-Who tried to kill you and how You-Know-Who disappeared and everything and how you've still got a lightning scar on your forehead\" (You-Know-Who eyes raked Harry's hairline) \"and a boy in my dormitory said if I develop the film in the right potion, the pictures'll move.\" Colin drew a great shuddering breath of excitement and said, \"It's amazing here, isn't it? I never knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till I got the letter from Hogwarts. My dad's a milkman, My dad's a milkman couldn't believe My dad's a milkman either. So I'm taking loads of pictures to send home to My dad's a milkman. And it'd be really good if I had one of you\" -- My dad's a milkman looked imploringly at Harry ",
    "-- \"maybe your friend could take it and I could stand next to My dad's a milkman? And then, could you sign it?\" ",
    "\" Signed photos? You're giving out signed photos, the famous Harry Potter?\" ",
    "Loud and scathing, Draco Malfoy's voice echoed around the overcast courtyard. Draco Malfoy's had stopped right behind Colin, flanked, as Draco Malfoy's always was at Hogwarts, by Draco Malfoy's large and thuggish cronies, Crabbe and Goyle. ",
    "\"Everyone line up!\" Draco Malfoy's roared to the crowd. \"the famous Harry Potter giving out signed photos!\" ",
    "\"No, I'm not,\" said Harry angrily, Harry fists clenching. \"Shut up, Draco Malfoy's.\" ",
    "\"You're just jealous,\" piped up Colin, whose entire body was about as thick as Crabbe 's neck. ",
    "\"Jealous?\" said Malfoy, who didn't need to shout anymore: Half the courtyard was listening in. \"Of what? I don't want a foul scar right across my head, thanks. I don't think getting your head cut open makes you that special, myself.\" ",
    "Crabbe and Goyle were sniggering stupidly. ",
    "\"Eat slugs, Malfoy,\" said Ron angrily. Crabbe stopped laughing and started rubbing Crabbe knuckles in a menacing way. ",
    "\"Be careful, HARRY,\" sneered Draco Malfoy's. \"You don't want to start any trouble or your mommy'll have to come and take you away from school.\" Crabbe put on a shrill, piercing voice. \"If you put another toe out of line ",
    "A knot of Slytherin fifth years nearby laughed loudly at this. ",
    "HARRY HARRY would like a signed photo, the famous Harry Potter,\" smirked Draco Malfoy's. \"It'd be worth more than Crabbe family's whole house -- \" ",
    "Ron whipped out Crabbe , but \" ",
    "Hermione shut Voyages with Vampires with a snap and whispered, \"Look out!\" ",
    "\"What's all this, what's all this?\" Gilderoy Lockhart was striding toward them, Gilderoy Lockhart turquoise robes swirling behind Gilderoy Lockhart. \"Who's giving out signed photos?\" ",
    "Harry started to speak but \" ",
    "Harry was cut short as Gilderoy Lockhart flung an arm around \" ",
    "Harry shoulders and thundered jovially, \"Shouldn't have asked! We meet again, Harry!\" ",
    "Pinned to Gilderoy Lockhart's side and burning with humiliation, Harry saw Draco Malfoy's slide smirking back into the crowd. ",
    "\"Come on then, Colin Creevey,\" said Gilderoy Lockhart, beaming at Colin. \"A double portrait, can't do better than that, and well both sign it for A double portrait.\" ",
    "Colin fumbled for \" ",
    "Colin camera and took the picture as the bell rang behind them, signaling the start of afternoon classes. ",
    "\"Off you go, move along there,Gilderoy Lockhart Gilderoy Lockhart called to the crowd, and Gilderoy Lockhart set off back to the castle with Harry, who was wishing Gilderoy Lockhart knew a good Vanishing Spell, still clasped to Lockhart's side. ",
    "\"A word to the wise, Harry,\" said Gilderoy Lockhart paternally as the wise, Harry entered the building through a side door. \"I covered up for you back there with Colin Creevey -- if Colin Creevey was photographing me, too, your schoolmates won't think you're setting yourself up so much. ...\" ",
    "Deaf to Harry's stammers, Gilderoy Lockhart swept Gilderoy Lockhart down a corridor lined with staring students and up a staircase. ",
    "\"Let me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage of your career isn't sensible -- looks a tad bigheaded, Harry, to be frank. There may well come a time when, like Gilderoy Lockhart, you'll need to keep a stack handy wherever you go, but\" -- Gilderoy Lockhart gave a little chortle -- \"I don't think you're quite there yet.\" ",
    "They had reached Gilderoy Lockhart's classroom and Gilderoy Lockhart let Harry go at last. Harry yanked his turquoise robes straight and headed for a seat at the very back of the class, where Harry busied Harry with piling all seven of Gilderoy Lockhart's books in front of Harry, so that Harry could avoid looking at the real thing. ",
    "The rest of the class came clattering in, and Ron and Hermione sat down on either side of Harry. ",
    "\"You could've fried an egg on your face,\" said Ron. \"You'd better hope Colin Creevey doesn't meet Ginny, or Colin Creevey'll be starting a the famous Harry Potter fan club.\" ",
    "\"Shut up,\" snapped Harry. The last thing Harry needed was for Gilderoy Lockhart to hear the phrase \"the famous Harry Potter fan club.\" ",
    "When the class was seated, Gilderoy Lockhart cleared Gilderoy Lockhart throat loudly and silence fell. Gilderoy Lockhart reached forward, picked up Neville Longbottom's copy of Travels with ",
    "Trolls, and held it up to show Gilderoy Lockhart own, winking portrait on the front. ",
    "\"Me,\" Gilderoy Lockhart said, pointing at it and winking as well. \"Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly's Most- Charming- Smile Award -- but I don't talk about that. I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at the Bandon Banshee!\" ",
    "Gilderoy Lockhart waited for them to laugh; a few people smiled weakly. ",
    "\"I see you've all bought a complete set of my books -- well done. I thought we'd start today with a little quiz. Nothing to worry about -- just to check how well you've read them, how much you've taken in -- \" ",
    "When Gilderoy Lockhart had handed out the test papers Gilderoy Lockhart returned to the front of the class and said, \"You have thirty minutes -- start -- now\\\" ",
    "Harry looked down at now\\\" ",
    "Harry paper and read: ",
    "1. What is Gilderoy Lockhart favorite color? ",
    "2. What is Gilderoy Lockhart secret ambition? ",
    "3. What, in your opinion, is Gilderoy Lockhart greatest achievement to date? ",
    "On and on it went, over three sides of paper, right down to: ",
    "54. When is Gilderoy Lockhart birthday, and what would Gilderoy Lockhart ideal gift be? ",
    "Half an hour later, Gilderoy Lockhart collected the test papers and rifled through the test papers in front of the class. ",
    "\"Tut, tut -- hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is lilac. I say so in Year with the Yeti. ",
    "And a few of you need to read Wanderings with Werewolves more carefully -- I clearly state in chapter twelve that his ideal gift would be harmony between all magic and non-magic peoples -- though I wouldn't say no to a large bottle of Ogden's Old Firewhisky!\" ",
    "Gilderoy Lockhart gave them another roguish wink. Ron was now staring at Gilderoy Lockhart with an expression of disbelief on Ron face; Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who were sitting in front, were shaking with silent laughter. \" ",
    "Hermione, on the other hand, was listening to Gilderoy Lockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when Ron mentioned her name. ",
    "\"... but Miss Hermione Granger knew my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair-care potions -- good girl! In fact\" -- Ron flipped her paper over -- \"full marks! Where is Miss Hermione Granger?\" ",
    "Hermione raised a trembling hand. ",
    "\"Excellent!\" beamed Gilderoy Lockhart. \"Quite excellent! Take ten points for Gryffindor! And so -- to business -- \" ",
    "Ron bent down behind Ron desk and lifted a large, covered cage onto his desk. ",
    "\"Now -- be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind! You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here. All I ask is that you remain calm.\" ",
    "In spite of himself, Harry leaned around Harry pile of books for a better look at a large, covered cage. Gilderoy Lockhart placed a hand on the cover. Dean and Seamus had stopped laughing now. Neville was cowering in Neville front row seat. ",
    "\"I must ask you not to scream,\" said Gilderoy Lockhart in a low voice. \"It might provoke Dean and Seamus.\" ",
    "As the class held the class breath, Gilderoy Lockhart whipped off the cover. ",
    "\"Yes,\" Gilderoy Lockhart said dramatically. \" Freshly caught Cornish pixies.\" ",
    "Seamus Finnigan couldn't control Seamus Finnigan. Seamus Finnigan let out a snort of laughter that Gilderoy Lockhart Gilderoy Lockhart couldn't mistake for a scream of terror. ",
    "\"Yes?\" Seamus Finnigan smiled at Seamus. ",
    "\"Well, they're not -- they're not very -- dangerous, are they?\" Seamus choked. ",
    "\"Don't be so sure!\" said Gilderoy Lockhart, waggling a finger annoyingly at Seamus. \"Devilish tricky little blighters they can be!\" ",
    "Cornish pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high, with pointed faces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgies arguing. The moment the cover had been removed, they had started jabbering and rocketing around, rattling the bars and making bizarre faces at the people nearest they. ",
    "\"Right, then,\" Gilderoy Lockhart said loudly. \"Let's see what you make of they!\" And Gilderoy Lockhart opened a large, covered cage. ",
    "It was pandemonium. Cornish pixies shot in every direction like rockets. Two of Cornish pixies seized Neville by the ears and lifted Neville into the air. Several shot straight through the window, showering the back row with broken glass. The rest proceeded to wreck Lockhart's classroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino. The rest grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with The rest, shredded books and papers, tore pictures from the walls, up-ended the waste basket, grabbed bags and books and threw bags and books out of the window; within minutes, half the class was sheltering under desks and Neville was swinging from the iron chandelier in the ceiling. ",
    "\"Come on now -- round bags and books up, round bags and books up, bags and books're only pixies,\" Gilderoy Lockhart shouted. ",
    "Gilderoy Lockhart rolled up Gilderoy Lockhart sleeves, brandished Gilderoy Lockhart , and bellowed, \"Peskipiksi Pesternomti\" ",
    "It had absolutely no effect; one of Cornish pixies seized Gilderoy Lockhart and threw his wand out of the window, too. Gilderoy Lockhart gulped and dived under Gilderoy Lockhart own desk, narrowly avoiding being squashed by Neville, who fell a second later as the iron chandelier in the ceiling gave way. ",
    "The bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit. In the relative calm that followed, Gilderoy Lockhart straightened up, caught sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who were almost at the door, and said, \"Well, I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into them cage.\" Gilderoy Lockhart swept past them and shut the door quickly behind Gilderoy Lockhart. ",
    "\"Can you believe Gilderoy Lockhart?\" roared Ron as one of Cornish pixies bit Gilderoy Lockhart painfully on the ear. ",
    "\"Gilderoy Lockhart just wants to give us some hands-on experience,\" said \" ",
    "Hermione, immobilizing two pixies at once with a ",
    "clever Freezing Charm and stuffing two pixies back into two pixies . ",
    "\"Hands on?\" said Harry, who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of reach with its tongue out. \"\" ",
    "Hermione, he didn't have a clue what he was doing ",
    "\"Rubbish,\" said \" ",
    "Hermione. \"You've read he books -- look at all those amazing things he's done -- \" ",

  "THE WHOMPING WILLOW": [
    "The end of the summer vacation came too quickly for Harry's liking. Harry was looking forward to getting back to Hogwarts, but Harry month at the Burrow had been the happiest of Harry life. It was difficult not to feel jealous of Ron when Ron thought of the Dursleys and the sort of welcome Ron could expect next time Ron turned up on Privet Drive. ",
    "On their last evening, Mrs. Weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner that included all of Harry's favorite things, ending with a mouthwatering treacle pudding. Fred and George rounded off their last evening with a display of Filibuster fireworks; Fred and George filled the kitchen with red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at least half an hour. Then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate and bed. ",
    "It took a long while to get started next morning. They were up at dawn, but somehow They still seemed to have a great deal to do. Mrs. Weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks and quills; people kept colliding on the stairs, half-dressed with bits of  ",
    "toast in people hands; and Mrs. Weasley nearly broke Mrs. Weasley neck, tripping over a stray chicken as Mrs. Weasley crossed the yard carrying Ginny's trunk to the car. ",
    "Harry couldn't see how eight people, six large trunks, two owls, and a rat were going to fit into one small Ford Anglia. Harry had reckoned, of course, without the special features that Mrs. Weasley had added. ",
    "\"Not a word to Molly,\" Harry whispered to Harry as Harry opened Ginny's trunk and showed Harry how Ginny's trunk had been magically expanded so that the luggage fitted easily. ",
    "When at last they were all in the car, Mrs. Weasley glanced into the back seat, where Harry, Ron, Fred, George, and Percy were all sitting comfortably side by side, and said, \"Muggles do know more than we give they credit for, don't they?\" Ginny and Ginny got into the front seat, which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench. \"I mean, you'd never know it was this roomy from the outside, would you?\" ",
    "Mrs. Weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard, Harry turning back for a last look at the house. Harry barely had time to wonder when Harry'd see it again when they were back -- George had forgotten George box of Filibuster fireworks. Five minutes after that, they skidded to a halt in the yard so that Fred could run in for Fred broomstick. they had almost reached the highway when Ginny shrieked that Ginny'd left Ginny diary. By the time Ginny had clambered back into the car, they were running very late, and tempers were running high. ",
    "Mrs. Weasley glanced at Mrs. Weasley watch and then at Mrs. Weasley wife. ",
    "\"Molly, dear -- \" ",
    "\"No, Arthur -- \" ",
    "\"No one would see -- this little button here is an Invisibility Booster I installed -- that'd get us up in the air -- then us fly above the clouds. us'd be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser -- \" ",
    "\"I said no, Arthur, not in broad daylight -- \" ",
    "They reached King's Cross at a quarter to eleven. Mrs. Weasley dashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the station. ",
    "Harry had caught the Hogwarts Express the previous year. The tricky part was getting onto platform nine and three-quarters, which wasn't visible to the Muggle eye. What you had to do was walk through the solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. It didn't hurt, but It had to be done carefully so that none of the Muggles noticed you vanishing. ",
    "\"Percy first,\" said Mrs. Weasley, looking nervously at the clock overhead, which showed they had only five minutes to disappear casually through the barrier. ",
    "Percy strode briskly forward and vanished. Mrs. Weasley went next; Fred and George George followed. ",
    "\"I'll take Ginny and you two come right after us,Mrs. Weasley told Harry and Ron, grabbing Ginny's hand and setting off. In the blink of an eye they were gone. ",
    "\"Let's go together, us've only got a minute,Ron Ron said to Harry. ",
    "Harry made sure that Hedwig's cage was safely wedged on top of Harry trunk and wheeled Harry trolley around to face the barrier. Harry felt perfectly confident; this wasn't nearly as uncomfortable as using Floo ",
    "powder. Both of them bent low over the handles of Both of them trolleys and walked purposefully toward the barrier, gathering speed. A few feet away from A few feet, Both of them broke into a run and -- ",
    "CRASH. ",
    "Both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward; Ron's trunk fell off with a loud thump, Harry was knocked off A few feet, and Hedwig's cage bounced onto the shiny floor, and Hedwig's cage rolled away, shrieking indignantly; people all around Both of them stared and a guard nearby yelled, \"What in blazes d'you think you're doing?\" ",
    "\"Lost control of his trolley,Harry Harry gasped, clutching Harry ribs as Harry got up. Ron ran to pick up Hedwig, who was causing such a scene that there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the surrounding crowd. ",
    "\"Why can't we get through?\" Harry hissed to Ron. ",
    "\"I dunno -- \" ",
    "Ron looked wildly around. A dozen curious people were still watching A dozen curious people. ",
    "\"we're going to miss the train,\" ",
    "Ron whispered. \"I don't understand why the gateway's sealed the gateway -- \" ",
    "Harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit of Harry stomach. Ten seconds ... nine seconds ... ",
    "Harry wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until his trolley was right against the barrier and pushed with all Harry might. The metal remained solid. ",
    "Three seconds ... two seconds ... one second ... ",
    "\"It's gone,\" said Ron, sounding stunned. \"the train's left. What if Mum and Dad can't get back through to we? Have you got any Muggle money?\" ",
    "Harry gave a hollow laugh. \"The Dursleys haven't given me pocket money for about six years.\" ",
    "Ron pressed Ron ear to the cold barrier. ",
    "\"Can't hear a thing,\" Ron said tensely. \"What're we going to do? I don't know how long it'll take Mum and Dad to get back to we.\" ",
    "Mum and Dad looked around. People were still watching Mum and Dad, mainly because of Hedwig's continuing screeches. ",
    "\"I think we'd better go and wait by the car,\" said Harry. \"we're attracting too much atten -- \" ",
    "\"Harry!\" said Ron, Ron eyes gleaming. \"The car!\" ",
    "\"What about it?\" ",
    "\"We can fly the car to Hogwarts!\" ",
    "\"But I thought -- \" ",
    "\"We're stuck, right? And We've got to get to school, haven't We? And even underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it's a real emergency, section nineteen or something of the Restriction of Thingy -- \" ",
    "\"But your mum and dad ...\" said Harry, pushing against the barrier again in the vain hope that the barrier would give way. \"How will they get home?\" ",
    "\"they don't need the car!\" said Ron impatiently. \"they know how to Apparate! You know, just vanish and reappear at home! they only bother with Floo powder and the car because we're all underage and we're not allowed to Apparate yet. ...\" ",
    "Harry's feeling of panic turned suddenly to excitement. ",
    "\"Can you fly it?\" ",
    "\"No problem,\" said Ron, wheeling his trolley around to face the exit. \"C'mon, let's go. If we hurry we'll be able to follow the Hogwarts Express -- \" ",
    "And they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles, out of the station and back onto the side road where the old Ford Anglia was parked. ",
    "Ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from Ron wand. they heaved they luggage back in, put Hedwig on the back seat, and got into the front. ",
    "\"Check that no one's watching,\" said Ron, starting the ignition with another tap of his wand. Harry stuck Harry head out of the window: Traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead, but their street was empty. ",
    "\"Okay,\" Harry said. ",
    "Ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard. The car around them vanished -- and so did them. Harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath Harry, hear the engine, feel Harry hands on Harry knees and Harry glasses on Harry nose, but for all Harry could see, Harry had become a pair of eyeballs, floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars. ",
    "\"Let's go,\" said Ron's voice from Harry right. ",
    "And the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away, dropping out of sight as the car rose; in seconds, the whole of London lay, smoky and glittering, below the whole of London. ",
    "Then there was a popping noise and the car, Harry, and Ron reappeared. ",
    "\"Uh-oh,\" said Ron, jabbing at the Invisibility Booster. \"It's faulty -- \" ",
    "Both of them pummeled the Invisibility Booster. the car vanished. Then the car flickered back again. ",
    "\"Hold on!\" Ron yelled, and Ron slammed Ron foot on the accelerator; they shot straight into the low, woolly clouds and everything turned dull and foggy. ",
    "\"Now what?\" said Harry, blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressing in on them from all sides. ",
    "\"We need to see the train to know what direction to go in,\" said Ron. ",
    "\"Dip back down again -- quickly -- \" ",
    "They dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in They seats, squinting at the ground. ",
    "\"I can see it!\" Harry yelled. \"Right ahead -- there!\" ",
    "the Hogwarts Express was streaking along below They like a scarlet snake. ",
    "\"Due north,\" said Ron, checking the compass on the dashboard. \"Okay, we'll just have to check on the Hogwarts Express every half hour or so -- hold on -- \" ",
    "And They shot up through the clouds. A minute later, They burst out into a blaze of sunlight. ",
    "It was a different world. The wheels of the car skimmed the sea of fluffy cloud, the sky a bright, endless blue under the blinding white sun. ",
    "\"All we've got to worry about now are airplanes,\" said Ron. ",
    "They looked at each other and started to laugh; for a long time, They couldn't stop. ",
    "It was as though They had been plunged into a fabulous dream. This, thought Harry, was surely the only way to travel -- past swirls and turrets of snowy cloud, in a car full of hot, bright sunlight, with a fat pack of toffees in the glove compartment, and the prospect of seeing Fred's and George's jealous faces when Fred's and George's jealous faces landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of Hogwarts castle. ",
    "Fred's and George's jealous faces made regular checks on the train as Fred's and George's jealous faces flew farther and farther north, each dip beneath the clouds showing Fred's and George's jealous faces a different view. London was soon far behind Fred's and George's jealous faces, replaced by neat green fields that gave way in turn to wide, purplish moors, a great city alive with cars like multicolored ants, villages with tiny toy churches. ",
    "Several uneventful hours later, however, Harry had to admit that some of the fun was wearing off. The toffees had made some of the fun was wearing off extremely thirsty and some of the fun was wearing off had nothing to drink. Harry and Ron had pulled off He and Ron sweaters, but Harry's T-shirt was sticking to the back of Harry seat and Harry glasses kept sliding down to the end of Harry sweaty nose. Harry had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and was thinking longingly of the train miles below, where you could  ",
    "buy ice-cold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch. Why hadn't He and Ron been able to get onto platform nine and three-quarters? ",
    "\"Can't be much further, can it?\" croaked Ron, hours later still, as the sun started to sink into He and Ron floor of cloud, staining their floor of cloud a deep pink. \"Ready for another check on the train?\" ",
    "It was still right below them, winding It way past a snowcapped mountain. It was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds. ",
    "Ron put Ron foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again, but as Ron did so, the engine began to whine. ",
    "Harry and Ron exchanged nervous glances. ",
    "\"It's probably just tired,\" said Ron. \"It's never been this far before. ...\" ",
    "And Harry and Ron pretended not to notice the whining growing louder and louder as the sky became steadily darker. Stars were blossoming in the blackness. ",
    "Harry pulled Harry sweater back on, trying to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving feebly, as though in protest. ",
    "\"Not far,\" said Ron, more to the car than to Harry, ",
    "\"not far now,\" and Ron patted the dashboard nervously. ",
    "When Harry and Ron flew back beneath the clouds a little while later, Harry and Ron had to squint through the darkness for a landmark Harry and Ron knew. ",
    "\"There!\" Harry shouted, making Ron and Hedwig jump. \"Straight ahead!\" ",
    "Silhouetted on the dark horizon, high on the cliff over the lake, stood the many turrets and towers of Hogwarts castle. ",
    "But the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed. ",
    "\"Come on,Ron Ron said cajolingly, giving the steering wheel a little shake, \"nearly there, come on -- \" ",
    "The engine groaned. Narrow jets of steam were issuing from under the hood. Harry found Harry gripping the edges of his seat very hard as they flew toward the lake. ",
    "the car gave a nasty wobble. Glancing out of Harry window, Harry saw the smooth, black, glassy surface of the water, a mile below. Ron's knuckles were white on the steering wheel. the car wobbled again. ",
    "\"Come on,Ron Ron muttered. ",
    "They were over the lake -- the castle was right ahead -- Ron put Ron foot down. ",
    "There was a loud clunk, a splutter, and the engine died completely. ",
    "\"Uh-oh,\" said Ron, into the silence. ",
    "The nose of the car dropped. They were falling, gathering speed, heading straight for the solid castle wall. ",
    "\"IVoooooo!\" Ron yelled, swinging the steering wheel around; They missed the solid castle wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc, soaring over the dark greenhouses, then the vegetable patch, and then out over the black lawns, losing altitude all the time. ",
    "Ron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out of Ron back pocket -- ",
    "\"STOP! STOP!\" Ron yelled, whacking the dashboard and the windshield, but they were still plummeting, the ground flying up toward they -- ",
    "\"WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE!\" Harry bellowed, lunging for the steering wheel, but too late -- ",
    "CRUNCH. ",
    "With an earsplitting bang of metal on wood, they hit the thick tree trunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt. Steam was billowing from under the hood; Hedwig was shrieking in terror; a golf-ball-sized lump was throbbing on Harry's head where Harry had hit the windshield; and to Harry right, Ron let out a low, despairing groan. ",
    "\"Are you okay?\" Harry said urgently. ",
    "\"his wand,\" said Ron, in a shaky voice. \"Look at his wand -- \" ",
    "It had snapped, almost in two; the tip was dangling limply, held on by a few splinters. ",
    "Harry opened Harry mouth to say Harry was sure they'd be able to mend It up at the school, but Harry never even got started. At that very moment, something hit Harry side of the car with the force of a charging bull, sending Harry lurching sideways into Ron, just as an equally heavy blow hit the roof. ",
    "\"What's happen -- ?Ron Ron gasped, staring through the windshield, and Harry looked around just in time to see a branch as ",
    "thick as a python smash into a branch as ",
    ". The tree they had hit was attacking they. The tree they had hit trunk was bent almost double, and The tree they had hit gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car Its trunk could reach. ",
    "\"Aaargh!\" said Ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into Ron door; the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from knuckle-like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof, which seemed to be caving -- ",
    "\"Run for it!\" Ron shouted, throwing Ron full weight against his door, but next second Ron had been knocked backward into Harry's lap by a vicious uppercut from another branch. ",
    "\"We're done for!\" Ron moaned as the ceiling sagged, but suddenly the floor of the car was vibrating -- the engine had restarted. ",
    "\"Reverse!\" Harry yelled, and the car shot backward; The tree they had hit was still trying to hit them; them could hear The tree they had hit roots creaking as The tree they had hit almost ripped The tree they had hit up, lashing out at them as them sped out of reach. ",
    "\"That,\" panted Ron, \"was close. Well done, car -- \" ",
    "The car, however, had reached the end of \" ",
    "The car tether. With two sharp clunks, the doors flew open and Harry felt Harry seat tip sideways: Next thing Harry knew Harry was sprawled on the damp ground. Loud thuds told Harry that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk; Hedwig's cage flew through the air and burst open; she rose out of the car with an angry screech and sped off toward the castle without a backward look. Then, dented, scratched, and steaming, the car rumbled off into the darkness, the car rear lights blazing angrily. ",
    "\"Come back!\" Ron yelled after it, brandishing his wand. \"Dad'll kill me!\" ",
    "But the car disappeared from view with one last snort from the car exhaust. ",
    "\"Can you believe our luck?\" said Ron miserably, bending down to pick up Scabbers. \"Of all the trees we could've hit, we had to get one that hits back.\" ",
    "Ron glanced over Ron shoulder at the ancient tree, which was still flailing his shoulder branches threateningly. ",
    "\"Come on,\" said Harry wearily, \"we'd better get up to the school. ...\" ",
    "It wasn't at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured. Stiff, cold, and bruised, they seized the ends of they trunks and began dragging they up the grassy slope, toward the great oak front doors. ",
    "\"I think the feast's already started,\" said Ron, dropping Ron trunk at the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window. \"Hey -- Harry -- come and look -- it's the Sorting!\" ",
    "Harry hurried over and, together, He and Ron peered in at the Great Hall. ",
    "Innumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long, crowded tables, making the golden plates and goblets sparkle. Overhead, the bewitched ceiling, which always mirrored the sky outside, sparkled with stars. ",
    "Through the forest of pointed black Hogwarts hats, Harry saw a long line of scared-looking first years filing into the Great Hall. Ginny was among them, easily visible because of Ginny vivid Weasley hair. Meanwhile, ",
    "Professor McGonagall, a bespectacled witch with her vivid Weasley hair in a tight bun, was placing the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat on a stool before the newcomers. ",
    "Every year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and dirty, sorted new students into the four Hogwarts houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin). Harry well remembered putting it on, exactly one year ago, and waiting, petrified, for it decision as it muttered aloud in Harry ear. For a few horrible seconds Harry had feared that the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat was going to put Harry in Slytherin, the House that had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other -- but Harry had ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, Hermione, and the rest of the Weasleys. Last term, Harry and Ron had helped Gryffindor win the House Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in seven years. ",
    "A very small, mousy-haired boy had been called forward to place the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat on A very small, mousy-haired boy head. Harry's eyes wandered past Harry to where Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from the staff table, Harry long silver beard and half-moon glasses shining brightly in the candlelight. Several seats along, Harry saw Gilderoy Lockhart, dressed in robes of aquamarine. And there at the end was Hagrid, huge and hairy, drinking deeply from Harry goblet. ",
    "\"Hang on ...\" Harry muttered to Ron. \"There's an empty chair at the staff table. ... Where's Snape?Snape Snape was Harry's least favorite teacher. Harry also happened to be Snape 's least favorite student. Cruel, sarcastic, and disliked by everybody except the students from Harry own House (Slytherin), Snape taught Potions. ",
    "\"Maybe Snape's ill!\" said Ron hopefully. ",
    "\"Maybe Snape's left,\" said Harry, \"because Snape missed out on the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again).\" ",
    "\"Or Snape might have been sacked).\" said Ron enthusiastically. \"I mean, everyone hates Snape -- \" ",
    "\"Or maybe,\" said a very cold voice right behind everyone, \"Snape's waiting to hear why you two didn't arrive on the school train.\" ",
    "Harry spun around. There, Snape black robes rippling in a cold breeze, stood Snape. Snape was a thin man with sallow skin, a hooked nose, and greasy, shoulder-length black hair, and at this moment, Snape was smiling in a way that told Harry Snape were in very deep trouble. ",
    "\"Follow me,\" said Snape. ",
    "Not daring even to look at each other, Harry and Ron followed Snape up the steps into the vast, echoing entrance hall, which was lit with flaming torches. A delicious smell of food was wafting from the Great Hall, but Snape led He and Ron away from the warmth and light, down a narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons. ",
    "\"In!\" Snape said, opening a door halfway down the cold passageway and pointing. ",
    "They entered Snape's office, shivering. The shadowy walls were lined with shelves of large glass jars, in which floated all manner of revolting things Harry didn't really want to know the name of at the moment. The fireplace was dark and empty. Snape closed a door and turned to look at They. ",
    "\"So,\" Snape said softly, \"the train isn't good enough for the famous Harry Potter and Snape faithful sidekick, Weasley. Wanted to arrive with a bang, did we, boys?\" ",
    "\"No, sir, it was the barrier at King's Cross, it -- \" ",
    "\"Silence!\" said Snape coldly. \"What have you done with the car?Ron Ron gulped. This wasn't the first time Snape had given Harry the impression of being able to read minds. But a moment later, Ron understood, as Snape unrolled today's issue of the Evening Prophet ",
    "\"You were seen,\" Ron hissed, showing them the headline: FLYING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES MUGGLES. Ron began to read aloud: \"Two Muggles in London, convinced them saw an old car flying over the Post Office tower ... at noon in Norfolk, Mrs. Hetty Bayliss, while hanging out her washing ... Mr. Angus Fleet, of Peebles, reported to police ... Six or seven Muggles in all. I believe your father works in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office?\" your father said, looking up at Ron and smiling still more nastily. \"Dear, dear ... Ron own son ...\" ",
    "Harry felt as though Harry'd just been walloped in the stomach by one of the mad tree's larger branches. If anyone found out Weasley had bewitched an old car flying over the Post Office tower ...Weasley hadn't thought of that. ... ",
    "\"I noticed, in my search of the park, that considerable damage seems to have been done to a very valuable Whomping Willow,Snape went on. ",
    "\"The tree they had hit did more damage to us than us -- Ron Ron blurted out. ",
    "\"Silence!\" snapped Snape again. \"Most unfortunately, you are not in his own House (Slytherin) and the decision to expel you does not rest with Ron. I shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power. You will wait here.\" ",
    "Harry and Ron stared at each other, white-faced. Harry didn't feel hungry anymore. Harry now felt extremely sick. Harry tried not to look at a large, slimy something suspended in green liquid on a shelf behind Snape 's desk. If Snape had gone to fetch Professor McGonagall, head of Gryffindor House, Snape had gone to fetch Professor McGonagall, head of Gryffindor House were hardly any better off. Snape might be fairer than Snape, but Snape was still extremely strict. ",
    "Ten minutes later, Snape returned, and sure enough it was Professor McGonagall who accompanied Snape. Harry had seen Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall angry on several occasions, but either Harry had forgotten just how thin Snape mouth could go, or Harry had never seen Snape this angry before. Snape raised Snape wand the moment Snape entered; Harry and Ron both flinched, but Snape merely pointed it at the empty fireplace, where flames suddenly erupted. ",
    "\"Sit,\" Snape said, and they both backed into chairs by the fire. ",
    "\"Explain,\" Snape said, Snape glasses glinting ominously. ",
    "Ron launched into the story, starting with the barrier at the station refusing to let them through. ",
    "\" -- so them had no choice, Professor McGonagall, them couldn't get on the train.\" ",
    "\"Why didn't you send them a letter by owl? I believe you have an owl?\" Professor McGonagall said coldly to Harry. ",
    "Harry gaped at Snape. Now Snape'd said it, that seemed the obvious thing to have done. ",
    "\"I -- I didn't think -- \" ",
    "\"That,\" said Professor McGonagall, \"is obvious.\" ",
    "There was a knock on the office door and Snape, now looking happier than ever, opened it. There stood Dumbledore. ",
    "Harry's whole body went numb. Dumbledore was looking unusually grave. Dumbledore stared down Dumbledore very crooked nose at Dumbledore, and Harry suddenly found Dumbledore wishing Dumbledore were still being beaten up by the Whomping Willow. ",
    "There was a long silence. Then Dumbledore said, \"Please explain why you did this.\" ",
    "this would have been better if Dumbledore had shouted. Harry hated the disappointment in Harry voice. For some reason, Harry was unable to look Dumbledore in the eyes, and spoke instead to Harry knees. Harry told Dumbledore everything except that Weasley owned the bewitched car, making Mr. Weasley owned the bewitched car sound as though He and Ron had happened to find a flying car parked outside the station. Harry knew Dumbledore would see through this at once, but Dumbledore asked no questions about the bewitched car. When Harry had finished, Harry merely continued to peer at He and Ron through Harry spectacles. ",
    "\"Well go and get our stuff,\" said Ron in a hopeless sort of voice. ",
    "\"What are you talking about, Weasley?\" barked Professor McGonagall. ",
    "\"Well, you're expelling our, aren't you?\" said Ron. ",
    "Harry looked quickly at Dumbledore. ",
    "\"Not today, Mr. Weasley,\" said Dumbledore. \"But I must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to both your families tonight. I must also warn you that if you do anything like this again, I will have no choice but to expel you.Snape Snape looked as though Christmas had been canceled. Snape cleared Snape and said, DumbledoreDumbledore, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree -- surely acts of this nature -- \" ",
    "\"It will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these boys punishments, Severus,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"They are in his own House (Slytherin) and are therefore her responsibility.\" Snape turned to Professor McGonagall. \"I must go back to the feast, Minerva, I've got to give out a few notices. Come, Severus, there's a delicious- looking custard tart I want to sample -- Snape Snape shot a look of pure venom at Harry and Ron as Harry allowed Harry to be swept out of Harry office, leaving Harry and Ron alone with Professor McGonagall, who was still eyeing Harry and Ron like a wrathful eagle. ",
    "\"You'd better get along to the hospital wing, Weasley, you're bleeding.\" ",
    "\"Not much,\" said Ron, hastily wiping the cut over Ron eye with Ron sleeve. \"Professor McGonagall, I wanted to watch my sister being Sorted -- \" ",
    "\"The Sorting Ceremony is over,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"my sister is also in Gryffindor.\" ",
    "\"Oh, good,\" said Ron. ",
    "\"And speaking of Gryffindor -- \" Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall said sharply, but Harry cut in: \"Professor, when we took the bewitched car, term hadn't started, so -- so Gryffindor shouldn't really have points taken from Gryffindor -- should Gryffindor?\" Professor McGonagall finished, watching my sister anxiously. ",
    "Professor McGonagall gave Professor McGonagall a piercing look, but Professor McGonagall was sure my sister had almost smiled. my sister mouth looked less thin, anyway. ",
    "\"I will not take any points from Gryffindor,\" my sister said, and Harry's heart lightened considerably. \"But you will both get a detention.\" ",
    "It was better than Harry had expected. As for Dumbledore's writing to the Dursleys, that was nothing. Harry knew perfectly well they'd just be disappointed that the Whomping Willow hadn't squashed Harry flat. ",
    "Professor McGonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at Snape's desk. A large plate of sandwiches, two silver goblets, and a jug of iced pumpkin juice appeared with a pop. ",
    "\"You will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory,\" Professor McGonagall said. \"I must also return to the feast.\" ",
    "When a door had closed behind Professor McGonagall, Ron let out a long, low whistle. ",
    "\"I thought we'd had it,\" Ron said, grabbing a sandwich. ",
    "\"So did I,\" said Harry, taking one, too. ",
    "\"Can you believe we luck, though?\" said Ron thickly through a mouthful of chicken and ham. \"Fred and George must've flown that car five or six times and no Muggle ever saw Fred and George.\" Ron swallowed and took another huge bite. \"Why couldn't we get through the barrier?\" ",
    "Harry shrugged. \"we'll have to watch we step from now on, though,\" Ron said, taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice. \"Wish we could've gone up to the feast. ...\" ",
    "\"She didn't want we showing off,\" said Ron sagely. \"Doesn't want people to think it's clever, arriving by that car.\" ",
    "When they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could (the plate kept refilling the plate), they rose and left Snape's office, treading the familiar path to Gryffindor Tower. The castle was quiet; The castle seemed that the feast was over. they walked past muttering portraits and creaking suits of armor, and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs, until at last they reached the passage where the secret entrance to Gryffindor Tower was hidden, behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress. ",
    "\"Password?\" she said as they approached. ",
    "\"Er -- \" said Harry. ",
    "they didn't know the new year's password, not having met a Gryffindor prefect yet, but help came almost immediately; they heard hurrying feet behind they and turned to see Hermione dashing toward they. ",
    "\"There you are! Where have you been? The most ridiculous rumors -- someone said you'd been expelled for crashing a flying car -- \" ",
    "\"Well, we haven't been expelled,\" Harry assured Harry. ",
    "\"You're not telling me you did fly here?\" said Hermione, sounding almost as severe as Professor McGonagall. ",
    "\"Skip the lecture,\" said Ron impatiently, \"and tell we the new year's password.\" ",
    "\"It's 'wattlebird,' \" said Hermione impatiently, \"but that's not the point -- \" ",
    "Her words were cut short, however, as the portrait of the fat lady swung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping. It looked as though the whole of Gryffindor House was still awake, packed into the circular common room, standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs, waiting for them to arrive. Arms reached through the portrait hole to pull Harry and Ron inside, leaving Hermione to scramble in after Harry and Ron. ",
    "\"Brilliant!\" yelled Lee Jordan. \"Inspired! What an entrance! Flying a car right into the Whomping Willow, people'll be talking about that one for years -- ",
    "\"Good for you,\" said a fifth year Harry had never spoken to; someone was patting someone on the back as though someone'd just won a marathon; Fred and George George pushed Fred and George way to the front of the crowd and said together, \"Why couldn't Fred and George've come in a car, eh?\" Ron was scarlet in the face, grinning embarrassedly, but Harry could see Percy. Percy was visible over the heads of some excited first years, and Percy seemed to be trying to get near enough to start telling Fred and George off. Harry nudged Ron in the ribs and nodded in Percy's direction. Ron got the point at once. ",
    "\"Got to get upstairs -- bit tired,\" Ron said, and the two of Fred and George started pushing Fred and George way toward the door on the other side of the room, which led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories. ",
    "\" 'Night,\" Harry called back to Hermione, who was wearing a scowl just like Percy's. ",
    "Fred and George managed to get to the other side of the common room, still having Fred and George backs slapped, and gained the peace of the staircase. Fred and George hurried up the staircase, right to the top, and at last reached the door of Fred and George old dormitory, which now had a sign on the staircase saying SECOND YEARS. Fred and George entered the familiar, circular room, with Fred and George five four-posters hung with red velvet and Fred and George high, narrow windows. Fred and George trunks had been brought up for Fred and George and stood at the ends of Fred and George beds. ",
    "Ron grinned guiltily at Harry. ",
    "\"I know I shouldn't 've enjoyed that or anything, but -- ",
    "The dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year Gryffindor boys, Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville Longbottom. ",
    "\"Unbelievablel\" beamed Seamus. ",
    "\"Cool,\" said Dean. ",
    "\"Amazing,\" said Neville, awestruck. ",
    "Harry couldn't help it. Harry grinned, too. ",

  "MUDBLOODS AND MURMURS": [
    "Harry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight whenever he saw Gilderoy Lockhart coming down a corridor. Harder to avoid was Colin Creevey, who seemed to have memorized Harry's schedule. Nothing seemed to give Colin a bigger thrill than to say, \"All right, Harry?\" six or seven times a day and hear, \"Hello, Colin,\" back, however exasperated Harry sounded when Harry said it. ",
    "Hedwig was still angry with Harry about the disasterous car journey and his wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing his wand on Friday morning by shooting out of Ron's hand in Charms and hitting tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creating a large, throbbing green boil where his wand had struck. So with one thing and another, Harry was quite glad to reach the weekend. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday morning. Harry, however, was shaken awake several hours earlier than Harry would have liked by Oliver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team. ",
    "\"Whassamatter?\" said Harry groggily. ",
    "\"Quidditch practice!\" said Wood. \"Come on!Harry Harry squinted at the window. There was a thin mist hanging across the pink-and-gold sky. Now that Harry was awake, Harry couldn't understand how Harry could have slept through the racket the birds were making. ",
    "\"Oliver,\" Harry croaked. \"It's the crack of dawn.\" ",
    "\"Exactly,\" said Wood. Harry was a tall and burly sixth year and, at the moment, Harry eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm. \"It's part of our new training program. Come on, grab your broom, and let's go,\" said Wood heartily. \"None of the other teams have started training yet; our're going to be first off the mark this year -- \" ",
    "Yawning and shivering slightly, Harry climbed out of bed and tried to find Harry Quidditch robes. ",
    "\"Good man,\" said Wood. \"Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes.\" ",
    "When Harry'd found his Quidditch robes and pulled on Harry cloak for warmth, Harry scribbled a note to Ron explaining where Ron'd gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common room, Ron Nimbus Two Thousand on Ron shoulder. Ron had just reached the portrait hole when there was a clatter behind Ron and Colin Creevey came dashing down the spiral staircase, Ron camera swinging madly around Ron neck and something clutched in Ron hand. ",
    "\"I heard someone saying your name on the stairs, Harry! Look what I've got here! I've had it developed, I wanted to show you -- Harry Harry looked bemusedly at the photograph Colin was brandishing under Harry nose. ",
    "A moving, black-and-white Gilderoy Lockhart was tugging hard on an arm Harry recognized as Harry own. Harry was pleased to see that Harry photographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be dragged into view. As Harry watched, Gilderoy Lockhart gave up and slumped, panting, against the white edge of the picture. ",
    "\"Will you sign it?\" said Colin eagerly. ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry flatly, glancing around to check that the room was really deserted. \"Sorry, Colin, I'm in a hurry -- Quidditch practice -- \" ",
    "Gilderoy Lockhart climbed through the portrait hole. ",
    "\"Oh, wow! Wait for Gilderoy Lockhart! I've never watched a Quidditch game before!\" ",
    "Colin scrambled through the portrait hole after \" ",
    "Colin. ",
    "\"It'll be really boring,\" Harry said quickly, but Colin ignored \" ",
    "Colin, \" ",
    "Colin face shining with excitement. ",
    "\"You were the youngest House player in a hundred years, weren't you, Harry? Weren't you?\" said Colin, trotting alongside Harry. \"You must be brilliant. I've never flown. Is it easy? Is that your own broom? Is that the best one there is?\" ",
    "Harry didn't know how to get rid of Harry. It was like having an extremely talkative shadow. ",
    "\"I don't really understand Quidditch,\" said Colin breathlessly. \"Is it true there are four balls? And two of them fly around trying to knock people off people brooms?\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Harry heavily, resigned to explaining the complicated rules of Quidditch. \"They're called Bludgers. There are two Beaters on each team who carry clubs to beat Bludgers away from They side. Fred and George Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters.\" ",
    "\"And what are the other balls for?\" Colin asked, tripping down a couple of steps because Colin was gazing open-mouthed at Harry. ",
    "\"Well, the Quaffle -- that's the biggish red one -- is the one that scores goals. Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get the Quaffle through the goal posts at the end of the pitch -- Fred and George Weasley're three long poles with hoops on the end.\" ",
    "\"And the fourth ball -- \" ",
    "\" -- is the Golden Snitch,\" said Harry, \"and it's very small, very fast, and difficult to catch. But that's what the Seeker's got to do, because a game of Quidditch doesn't end until the Snitch has been caught. And whichever team's Seeker gets the Snitch the Snitch earns the Snitch team an extra hundred and fifty points.\" ",
    "\"And you're whichever team's Seeker, aren't you?\" said Colin in awe. ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Harry as they left the castle and started across the dew-drenched grass. \"And there's the Keeper, too. the Keeper guards the goal posts. That's it, really.\" ",
    "But Colin didn't stop questioning Harry all the way down the sloping lawns to the Quidditch field, and Harry only shook Harry off when Harry reached the changing rooms; Colin called after Harry in a piping voice, \"I'll go and get a good seat, Harry!\" and hurried off to the stands. ",
    "The rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the changing room. Wood was the only person who looked truly awake. Fred and George Weasley George Weasley were sitting, puffy-eyed and tousle-haired, next to fourth year Alicia Spinnet, who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind George Weasley. George Weasley fellow Chasers, Katie Bell and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side by side opposite Her fellow Chasers, Katie Bell and Angelina Johnson. ",
    "\"There you are, Harry, what kept you?\" said Wood briskly. \"Now, I wanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the Quidditch field, because I spent the summer devising a whole new training program, which I really think will make all the difference. ...\" ",
    "Wood was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch field, on which were drawn many lines, arrows, and crosses in different-colored inks. Wood took out Wood , tapped the board, and the arrows began to wiggle over a large diagram of a Quidditch field, on which were drawn many lines, arrows, and crosses in different-colored inks. As Wood launched into a speech about Wood new tactics, George Weasley head drooped right onto Alicia Spinnet's shoulder and Wood began to snore. ",
    "the board took nearly twenty minutes to explain, but there was another board under that, and a third under that one. Harry sank into a stupor as Wood droned on and on. ",
    "\"So,\" said Wood, at long last, jerking Harry from a wistful fantasy about what Wood could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up at the castle. \"Is that clear? Any questions?\" ",
    "\"I've got a question, Oliver,\" said George, who had woken with a start. \"Why couldn't you have told us all this yesterday when us were awake?\" ",
    "Wood wasn't pleased. ",
    "\"Now, listen here, you lot,\" Wood said, glowering at them all. \"us should have won the Quidditch Cup last year. us're easily the Gryffindor team. But unfortunately -- owing to circumstances beyond us control -- \" ",
    "Harry shifted guiltily in Harry seat. Harry had been unconscious in the hospital wing for the final match of the previous year, meaning that Gryffindor had been a player short and had suffered Gryffindor worst defeat in three hundred years. ",
    "Wood took a moment to regain control of Wood. Wood last defeat was clearly still torturing Wood. ",
    "\"So this year, we train harder than ever before. ... Okay, letwe go and put we new theories into practice!\" Wood shouted, seizing Wood broomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms. Stiff-legged and still yawning, the Gryffindor team followed. ",
    "the Gryffindor team had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up completely now, although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the stadium. As Harry walked onto the Quidditch field, Harry saw Ron, and Hermione sitting in the stands. ",
    "\"Aren't you finished yet?\" called Ron incredulously. ",
    "\"Haven't even started,\" said Harry, looking jealously at the toast and marmalade Ron, and Hermione had brought out of the Great Hall. \"Wood's been teaching we new moves.\" ",
    "Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground, soaring up into the air. The cool morning air whipped his face, waking Harry far more effectively than Wood's long talk. It felt wonderful to be back on the Quidditch field. Harry soared right around the stadium at full speed, racing Fred and George. ",
    "\"What's that funny clicking noise?\" called Fred as Ron, and Hermione hurtled around the corner. ",
    "Harry looked into the stands. Colin was sitting in one of the highest seats, Colin camera raised, taking picture after picture, the sound strangely magnified in the deserted stadium. ",
    "\"Look this way, Harry! This way!\" Harry cried shrilly. \"Who's that?\" said Fred. ",
    "\"No idea,Harry Harry lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took Harry as far away as possible from Colin. ",
    "\"What's going on?\" said Wood, frowning, as he skimmed through the air toward Wood, frowning. \"Why's that first year taking pictures? I don't like it. he could be a Slytherin spy, trying to find out about our new training program.\" ",
    "\"he's in Gryffindor,\" said Harry quickly. ",
    "\"And the Slytherins don't need a spy, Oliver,\" said George. ",
    "\"What makes you say that?\" said Wood testily. ",
    "\"Because they're here in person,\" said George, pointing. ",
    "Several people in green robes were walking onto the Quidditch field, broomsticks in Several people in green robes hands. ",
    "\"I don't believe it!\" Wood hissed in outrage. \"I booked the Quidditch field for today! We'll see about this!\" ",
    "Wood shot toward the ground, landing rather harder than \" ",
    "Wood meant to in \" ",
    "Wood anger, staggering slightly as \" ",
    "Wood dismounted. Harry, Fred, and George followed. ",
    "\"Flint!\" Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain. \"This is our practice time! our got up specially! You can clear off now!\" ",
    "Marcus Flint was even larger than Wood. Marcus Flint had a look of trollish cunning on Marcus Flint face as Marcus Flint replied, \"Plenty of room for all of our, Wood.\" ",
    "Angelina, Alicia, and Katie had come over, too. There were no girls on the Slytherin team, who stood shoulder to shoulder, facing the Gryffindors, leering to a man. ",
    "\"But I booked the Quidditch field!\" said Wood, positively spitting with rage. \"I booked it!\" ",
    "\"Ah,\" said \" ",
    "Marcus Flint. \"But Tve got a specially signed note here from Professor Snape. Professor Snape, give the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the Quidditch field owinq to the need to train the Quidditch field new Seeker. ' \" ",
    "\"You've got a new Seeker?\" said Wood, distracted. \"Where?\" ",
    "And from behind the six large figures before the six large figures came a seventh, smaller boy, smirking all over a seventh, smaller boy pale, pointed face. It was Draco Malfoy. ",
    "\"Aren't you Draco Malfoy son?\" said Fred, looking at Draco Malfoy with dislike. ",
    "\"Funny you should mention Draco's father,\" said \" ",
    "Marcus Flint as the whole Slytherin team smiled still more broadly. ",
    "\"Let me show you the generous gift Lucius Malfoy's son's made to the whole Slytherin team.\" ",
    "All seven of them held out them broomsticks. Seven highly polished, brand-new handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the words Nimbus Two Thousand and One gleamed under the Gryffindors noses in the early morning sun. ",
    "\"Very latest model. Only came out last month,\" said \" ",
    "Marcus Flint carelessly, flicking a speck of dust from the end of his own. \"I believe it outstrips the old Two Thousand series by a considerable amount. As for the old Cleansweeps\" -- he smiled nastily at Fred and George, who were both clutching Cleansweep Fives -- \"sweeps the board with both.\" ",
    "None of the Gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a moment. Draco Malfoy was smirking so broadly Draco Malfoy cold eyes were reduced to slits. ",
    "\"Oh, look,\" said \" ",
    "Marcus Flint. \"A field invasion.\" ",
    "Ron and Hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on. ",
    "\"What's happening?\" Ron asked Harry. \"Why aren't you playing? And what's Draco Malfoy doing here?\" ",
    "Draco Malfoy was looking at Draco Malfoy, taking in Draco Malfoy Slytherin Quidditch robes. ",
    "\"I'm the new Slytherin Seeker, Weasley,\" said Draco Malfoy, smugly. \"Everyone's just been admiring the brooms my father's bought the Gryffindor team.\" ",
    "Ron gaped, openmouthed, at the seven superb broomsticks in front of Ron. ",
    "\"Good, aren't they?\" said Draco Malfoy smoothly. \"But perhaps the Gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms, too. You could raffle off those Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museum would bid for those Cleansweep Fives.\" ",
    "the whole Slytherin team howled with laughter. ",
    "\"At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy \"At least no one on the Gryffindor team way in,\" said Hermione sharply. \"\"At least no one on the Gryffindor team got in on pure talent.\" ",
    "The smug look on Draco Malfoy's face flickered. ",
    "\"No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood,\" No one spat. ",
    "Harry knew at once that Draco Malfoy had said something really bad because there was an instant uproar at Harry words. \" ",
    "Marcus Flint had to dive in front of Draco Malfoy to stop Fred and George George jumping on Fred, Alicia shrieked, \"How dare you\\\", and Ron plunged Ron hand into his Slytherin Quidditch robes, pulled out Ron , yelling, \"You'll pay for that one, Draco Malfoy!\" and pointed his wand furiously under \" ",
    "Marcus Flint's arm at Draco Malfoy's face. ",
    "A loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot out of the wrong end of Ron's wand, hitting Ron in the stomach and sending Ron reeling backward onto the grass. ",
    "\"Ron! Ron! Are you all right?\" squealed Hermione. ",
    "Ron opened Ron mouth to speak, but no words came out. Instead Ron gave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto Ron lap. ",
    "the whole Slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter. ",
    "\" ",
    "Marcus Flint was doubled up, hanging onto his new ",
    "broomstick for support. Draco Malfoy was on all fours, banging the ground with Draco Malfoy fist. the Gryffindors were gathered around Ron, who kept belching large, glistening slugs. Nobody seemed to want to touch Draco Malfoy. ",
    "\"We'd better get Draco Malfoy to Hagrid's, it's nearest,\" said Harry to Hermione, who nodded bravely, and the pair of them pulled Ron up by the arms. ",
    "\"What happened, Harry? What happened? Is Harry ill? But you can cure Harry, can't you?\" Colin had run down from his seat and was now dancing alongside them as them left the Quidditch field. Ron gave a huge heave and more slugs dribbled down Ron front. ",
    "\"Oooh,\" said Colin, fascinated and raising Ron camera. \"Can you hold Ron still, Harry?\" ",
    "\"Get out of the way, Colin!\" said Harry angrily. Ron, and Hermione Hermione supported Ron out of the stadium and across the grounds toward the edge of the forest. ",
    "\"Nearly there, Ron,\" said Hermione as the gamekeeper's cabin came into view. \"You'll be all right in a minute -- almost there -- \" ",
    "Ron, and Hermione were within twenty feet of Hagrid's house when the front door opened, but the front door wasn't Hagrid's who emerged. Gilderoy Lockhart, wearing robes of palest mauve today, came striding out. ",
    "\"Quick, behind here,\" Harry hissed, dragging Ron behind a nearby bush. Hermione followed, somewhat reluctantly. ",
    "\"It's a simple matter if you know what you're doing!\" Gilderoy Lockhart was saying loudly to Hagrid's. \"If you need help, you know where I am! I'll let you have a copy of ",
    "my book. I'm surprised you haven't already got one -- I'll sign one tonight and send a copy of ",
    "my book over. Well, good-bye!\" And Ron strode away toward the castle. ",
    "Harry waited until Gilderoy Lockhart was out of sight, then pulled Ron out of a nearby bush and up to Hagrid's's front door. They knocked urgently. ",
    "Hagrid's appeared at once, looking very grumpy, but Hagrid's expression brightened when Hagrid's saw who his expression was. ",
    "\"Bin wonderin' when you'd come ter see me -- come in, come in -- thought you mighta Gilderoy Lockhart Gilderoy Lockhart back again -- \" ",
    "Harry and Hermione supported Ron over the threshold into the one-roomed cabin, which had an enormous bed in one corner, a fire crackling merrily in the other. Hagrid's didn't seem perturbed by Ron's slug problem, which Harry hastily explained as Ron lowered Ron into a chair. ",
    "\"Better out than in,\" Ron said cheerfully, plunking a large copper basin in front of Ron. \"Get 'em all up, Ron.\" ",
    "\"I don't think there's anything to do except wait for it to stop,\" said Hermione anxiously, watching Ron bend over a large copper basin. \"That's a difficult curse to work at the best of times, but with a broken wand -- \" ",
    "Hagrid's was bustling around making them tea. His boarhound, Fang, was slobbering over Harry. ",
    "\"What did Gilderoy Lockhart want with His boarhound, Fang, Hagrid's?\" Harry asked, scratching Fang's ears. ",
    "\"Givin' me advice on gettin' kelpies out of a well,\" growled Hagrid, moving a half-plucked rooster off \"Givin' ",
    "scrubbed table and setting down the teapot. \"Like I don' know. An' bangin' on about some banshee he banished. If one word of it was true, I'll eat my kettle.\" ",
    "my kettle was most unlike Hagrid's to criticize a Hogwarts teacher, and Harry looked at Harry in surprise. Hermione, however, said in a voice somewhat higher than usual, \"I think you're being a bit unfair. ",
    "Gilderoy Lockhart obviously thought Gilderoy Lockhart was the best man for the job -- \" ",
    "\"Gilderoy Lockhart was the on'y man for the job,\" said Hagrid's, offering them a plate of treacle toffee, while Ron coughed squelchily into Ron basin. \"An' I mean the on'y one. Gettin' very difficult ter find anyone fer the Dark Arts job. People aren't too keen ter take it on, see. too keen ter're startin' ter think it's jinxed. No one's lasted long fer a while now. So tell me,\" said Hagrid's, jerking Hagrid's head at Ron. \"Who was he tryin' ter curse?\" ",
    "\"Malfoy called Hermione something -- it must've been really bad, because everyone went wild.\" ",
    "\"It was bad,\" said Ron hoarsely, emerging over the tabletop looking pale and sweaty. \"Draco Malfoy called her 'Mudblood,' Hagrid -- \" ",
    "Ron dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their appearance. Hagrid's looked outraged. ",
    "\"Hagrid's didn'!\" Hagrid's growled at Hermione. ",
    "\"Hagrid's did,\" she said. \"But I don't know what it means. I could tell it was really rude, of course -- \" ",
    "\"It's about the most insulting thing Hagrid's could think of,\" gasped Ron, coming back up. \"Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born -- you ",
    "know, non-magic parents. There are some wizards -- like Draco Malfoy's family -- who think they're better than everyone else because they're what people call pure- blood.\" Hagrid's gave a small burp, and a single slug fell into Hagrid's outstretched hand. Hagrid's threw a small burp into a large copper basin and continued, \"I mean, the rest of us know a small burp doesn't make any difference at all. Look at Neville Longbottom -- Neville Longbottom's pure-blood and Neville Longbottom can hardly stand a cauldron the right way up.\" ",
    "\"An' they haven't invented a spell Hermione Hermione can' do,\" said Hagrid's proudly, making Hermione go a brilliant shade of magenta. ",
    "\"It's a disgusting thing to call someone,\" said Ron, wiping Ron sweaty brow with a shaking hand. \"Dirty blood, see. Common blood. It's ridiculous. Most wizards these days are half-blood anyway. If us hadn't married Muggles us'd've died out.\" ",
    "we hadn't married Muggles retched and ducked out of sight again. ",
    "\"Well, I don' blame yeh fer tryin' ter curse we hadn't married Muggles, Ron,\" said Hagrid's loudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting a large copper basin. \"Bu' maybe it was a good thing yer wand backfired. 'Spect Lucius Malfoy would've come marchin' up ter school if Spect Lucius Malfoy cursed Spect Lucius Malfoy son. Least yer not in trouble.\" ",
    "Harry would have pointed out that trouble didn't come much worse than having slugs pouring out of your mouth, but Harry couldn't; Hagrid's's treacle toffee had cemented Harry jaws together. ",
    "HarryHarry,\" said Hagrid's abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought. \"Gotta bone ter pick with yeh. I've heard you've bin givin' out signed photos. How come I haven't got one?\" ",
    "Furious, Harry wrenched Harry teeth apart. ",
    "\"I have not been giving out signed photos,\" Harry said hotly. \"If Gilderoy Lockhart's still spreading that around -- \" ",
    "But then Harry saw that Hagrid's was laughing. ",
    "\"I'm on'y jokin',\" Harry said, patting Harry genially on the back and sending Harry face first into the table. \"I knew yeh hadn't really. I told Gilderoy Lockhart yeh didn' need teh. Yer more famous than yeh without tryin'.\" ",
    "\"Bet yeh didn't like that,\" said Harry, sitting up and rubbing yeh chin. ",
    "\"Don' think yeh did,\" said Hagrid, yeh eyes twinkling. \"An' then I told yeh I'd never read one o' yeh books an' yeh decided ter go. Treacle toffee, Ron?\" yeh added as Ron reappeared. ",
    "\"No thanks,\" said Ron weakly. \"Better not risk it.\" ",
    "\"Come an' see what I've bin growin',\" said Hagrid's as Harry and Hermione finished the last of Hagrid as Harry and Hermione tea. ",
    "In the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid's 's house were a dozen of the largest pumpkins Harry had ever seen. Each was the size of a large boulder. ",
    "\"Gettin' on well, aren't they?\" said Hagrid's happily. ",
    "\"Fer the Halloween feast ... should be big enough by then.\" ",
    "\"What've you been feeding they?\" said Harry. ",
    "Hagrid's looked over Hagrid's shoulder to check that they were alone. ",
    "\"Well, I've bin givin' they -- you know -- a bit o' help ",
    "Harry noticed Hagrid's's flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back wall of the cabin. Harry had had reason to believe before now that Hagrid's flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back wall of the cabin was not all Hagrid's flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back wall of the cabin looked; in fact, Harry had the strong impression that Hagrid's old school wand was concealed inside Hagrid's old school wand. Hagrid's wasn't supposed to use magic. Hagrid's had been expelled from Hogwarts in Hagrid's third year, but Harry had never found out why -- any mention of the matter and Hagrid's would clear Hagrid's throat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject was changed. ",
    "\"An Engorgement Charm, I suppose?\" said Hermione, halfway between disapproval and amusement. \"Well, you've done a good job on Hermione, halfway between disapproval and amusement.\" ",
    "\"That's what yer little sister said,\" said Hagrid's, nodding at Ron. \"Met yer little sister jus' yesterday.\" Hagrid's looked sideways at Harry, Hagrid's beard twitching. \"Said yer little sister was jus' lookin' round the grounds, but I reckon yer little sister was hopin' yer little sister might run inter someone else at Hagrid's house.\" Hagrid's winked at Harry. \"If yeh ask me, yeh wouldn' say no ter a signed -- \" ",
    "\"Oh, shut up,\" said Harry. Ron snorted with laughter and the ground was sprayed with slugs. ",
    "\"Watch it!\" Hagrid's roared, pulling Ron away from Ron precious pumpkins. ",
    "Hagrid's was nearly lunchtime and as Harry had only had one bit of treacle toffee since dawn, Harry was keen to go back to school to eat. They said good-bye to Hagrid's and walked back up to the castle, Ron hiccoughing occasionally, but only bringing up two very small slugs. ",
    "They had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rang out, \"There you are, Potter -- Weasley.\" Professor McGonagall was walking toward them, looking stern. \"You will both do your detentions this evening.\" ",
    "\"What're we doing, Professor McGonagall?\" said Ron, nervously suppressing a burp. ",
    "\" You will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with Mr. Filch,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And no magic, Potter -- Weasley -- elbow grease.\" ",
    "Ron gulped. Argus Filch, the caretaker, was loathed by every student in the School. ",
    "\"And you, Potter, will be helping Gilderoy Lockhart Gilderoy Lockhart answer Gilderoy Lockhart fan mail,\" said Professor McGonagall. ",
    "\"Oh n -- Professor McGonagall, can't I go and do the trophy room with Mr. Filch, too?\" said Harry desperately. ",
    "\"Certainly not,\" said Professor McGonagall, raising Professor McGonagall eyebrows. \"Gilderoy Lockhart Gilderoy Lockhart requested you particularly. Eight o'clock sharp, both of you.\" ",
    "Harry and Ron slouched into the Great Hall in states of deepest gloom, Hermione behind them, wearing a well-you-did-break-school-rules sort of expression. Harry didn't enjoy Harry shepherd's pie as much as Harry'd thought. \" ",
    "Harry and Ron felt \" ",
    "Harry and Ron'd got the worse deal. ",
    "\"Filch 'll have me there all night,\" said Ron heavily. ",
    "\"No magic! There must be about a hundred cups in the trophy room with Mr. Filch. I'm no good at Muggle cleaning.\" ",
    "\"I'd swap anytime,\" said Harry hollowly. \"I've had loads of practice with the Dursleys. Answering Gilderoy Lockhart's fan mail ... Gilderoy Lockhart'll be a nightmare. ...\" ",
    "Saturday afternoon seemed to melt away, and in what seemed like no time, it was five minutes to eight, and Harry was dragging Harry feet along the second-floor corridor to Gilderoy Lockhart's office. Harry gritted Harry teeth and knocked. ",
    "The door flew open at once. Gilderoy Lockhart beamed down at Gilderoy Lockhart. ",
    "\"Ah, here's the scalawag!\" Gilderoy Lockhart said. \"Come in, Harry, come in -- \" ",
    "Shining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles were countless framed photographs of Gilderoy Lockhart. Gilderoy Lockhart had even signed a few of countless framed photographs of Lockhart. Another large pile lay on Gilderoy Lockhart desk. ",
    "\"You can address the envelopes!\" Gilderoy Lockhart told Harry, as though this was a huge treat. \"This first one's to Gladys Gudgeon, bless Gladys Gudgeon -- huge fan of mine -- \" ",
    "The minutes snailed by. Harry let Gilderoy Lockhart's voice wash over Gilderoy Lockhart, occasionally saying, \"Mmm\" and \"Right\" and \"Yeah.\" Now and then Gilderoy Lockhart caught a phrase like, \"Fame's a fickle friend, Harry,\" or \"Celebrity is as celebrity does, remember that.\" ",
    "many candles burned lower and lower, making the light dance over the many moving faces of Gilderoy Lockhart watching Gilderoy Lockhart. Harry moved Harry aching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope, writing out Veronica Smethley's address. It must be nearly time to leave, Harry thought miserably, please let it be nearly time. ... ",
    "And then Harry heard something -- something quite apart from the spitting of the dying candles and Gilderoy Lockhart's prattle about Gilderoy Lockhart fans. ",
    "It was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a voice of breathtaking, ice-cold venom. ",
    "\"Come ... come to me. ... Let me rip you. ... Let me tear you. ... Let me kill you. ...\" ",
    "Harry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on Veronica Smethley's street. ",
    "\"What?\" me said loudly. ",
    "\"I know!\" said Gilderoy Lockhart. \"Six solid months at the top of the best-seller list! Broke all records!\" ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry frantically. \"That voice!\" ",
    "\"Sorry?\" said Gilderoy Lockhart, looking puzzled. \"What voice?\" ",
    "\"That -- that voice that said -- didn't you hear it?\" ",
    "Gilderoy Lockhart was looking at Harry in high astonishment. ",
    "\"What are you talking about, Harry? Perhaps you're getting a little drowsy? Great Scott -- look at the time! \"We've been here nearly four hours! I'd never have believed it -- the time's flown, hasn't it?\" ",
    "Harry didn't answer. Harry was straining Harry ears to hear What voice again, but there was no sound now except for Gilderoy Lockhart telling Harry Harry mustn't expect a treat like this every time Harry got detention. Feeling dazed, Harry left. ",
    "It was so late that the Gryffindor common room was almost empty. Harry went straight up to the ",
    "dormitory. Ron wasn't back yet. Harry pulled on Ron pajamas, got into bed, and waited. Half an hour later, Ron arrived, nursing Ron right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish into the Gryffindor common room. ",
    "\"My muscles have all seized up,\" Ron groaned, sinking on bed. \"Fourteen times Ron made me buff up that Quidditch Cup before Ron was satisfied. And then I had another slug attack all over a Special Award for Services to the School. Took ages to get the slime off. ",
    ". . . How was it with Gilderoy Lockhart?\" ",
    "Keeping Gilderoy Lockhart voice low so as not to wake Neville, Dean, and Seamus, Harry told Ron exactly what Ron had heard. ",
    "\"And Gilderoy Lockhart said Gilderoy Lockhart couldn't hear it?\" said Ron. Harry could see Ron frowning in the moonlight. ",
    "\"D'you think Ron was lying? But I don't get D'you -- even someone invisible would've had to open the door.\" ",
    "\"I know,\" said Harry, lying back in Harry four-poster and staring at the canopy above Harry. \"I don't get it either.\" ",

  "THE DEATHDAY PARTY": [
    "October arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle. Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students. Her Pepperup Potion worked instantly, though Her Pepperup Potion left the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward. Ginny Weasley, who had been looking pale, was bullied into taking some by Percy. The steam pouring from under Her vivid hair gave the impression that Her whole head was on fire. ",
    "Raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on end; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy streams, and Hagrid's pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds. Oliver Wood's enthusiasm for regular training sessions, however, was not dampened, which was why Harry was to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before Halloween, returning to Gryffindor Tower, drenched to the skin and splattered with mud. Even aside from the rain and wind the skin hadn't been a happy practice session. Fred and George, who had  ",
    "been spying on the Slytherin team, had seen for Fred and George, who had  ",
    "been spying on the Slytherin team the speed of those new Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones. Fred and George, who had  ",
    "been spying on the Slytherin team reported that the Slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs, shooting through the air like missiles. ",
    "As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor Harry came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as Harry was. Nearly Headless Nick, the ghost of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of a window, muttering under Harry breath, \"... don't fulfill Nearly Headless Nick, the ghost of Gryffindor Tower requirements ... half an inch, if that ...\" ",
    "\"Hello, Nick,\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Hello, hello,\" said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and looking round. Harry wore a dashing, plumed hat on Harry long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff, which concealed the fact that Harry neck was almost completely severed. Harry was pale as smoke, and Harry could see right through Harry to the dark sky and torrential rain outside. ",
    "\"You look troubled, young Potter,\" said Nick, folding a transparent letter as Nick spoke and tucking a transparent letter inside Nick doublet. ",
    "\"So do you,\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Ah,\" Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, \"a matter of no importance. ... It's not as though I really wanted to join. ... Thought I'd apply, but apparently I 'don't fulfill requirements' -- \" ",
    "In spite of Nick airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on Nick face. ",
    "\"But you would think, wouldn't you,\" Nick erupted suddenly, pulling a transparent letter back out of Nick pocket, ",
    "\"that getting hit forty-five times in his neck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt?\" ",
    "\"Oh -- yes,\" said Harry, who was obviously supposed to agree. ",
    "\"I mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all been quick and clean, and her whole head had come off properly, I mean, it would have saved me a great deal of pain and ridicule. However -- \" Nearly Headless Nick shook a transparent letter open and read furiously: ",
    "\" 'We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have parted company with whose heads bodies. You will appreciate that it would be impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as Horseback Head- Juggling and Head Polo. It is with the greatest regret, therefore, that I must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements. With very best wishes, Sir Patrick Delaney -Podmore.' \" ",
    "Fuming, Nearly Headless Nick stuffed a transparent letter away. ",
    "\"Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, Harry! Most people would think that's good and beheaded, but oh, no, it's not enough for Sir Properly Decapitated-Podmore . \" ",
    "Nearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and then said, in a far calmer tone, \"So -- what's bothering you? Anything I can do?\" ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry. \"Not unless you know where we can get seven free Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones for we match against Sly -- \" ",
    "The rest of Harry's sentence was drowned out by a high-pitched mewling from somewhere near The rest of Harry's sentence ",
    "ankles. The rest of Harry's sentence looked down and found The rest of Harry's sentence gazing into a pair of lamp-like yellow eyes. It was Mrs. Norris, the skeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker, ",
    "Argus Filch, as a sort of deputy in The rest of Harry's sentence endless battle against students. ",
    "\"You'd better get out of here, Harry,\" said Nick quickly. \"Filch isn't in a good mood -- Filch's got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frog brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five. Filch's been cleaning all morning, and if Filch sees you dripping mud all over the place -- \" ",
    "\"Right,\" said Harry, backing away from the accusing stare of Mrs. Norris, but not quickly enough. Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to connect Filch with Filch foul cat, Filch burst suddenly through a tapestry to Harry's right, wheezing and looking wildly about for the rule- breaker. There was a thick tartan scarf bound around Filch head, and Filch nose was unusually purple. ",
    "\"Filth!\" Filch shouted, Filch jowls aquiver, Filch eyes popping alarmingly as Filch pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from Harry's Quidditch robes. \"Mess and muck everywhere! I've had enough of it, I tell you! Follow me, Potter!\" ",
    "So Harry waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless Nick and followed Filch back downstairs, doubling the number of muddy footprints on the floor. ",
    "Harry had never been inside Filch's office before; Filch's office was a place most students avoided. The room was dingy and windowless, lit by a single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling. A faint smell of fried fish lingered about the place. Wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls; from Wooden filing cabinets labels, Harry could see that Wooden filing cabinets contained details of every pupil Filch  ",
    "had ever punished. Fred and George Weasley had an entire drawer to Fred and George Weasley. A highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind Filch's desk. It was common knowledge that he was always begging Dumbledore to let he suspend students by students ankles from the low ceiling. ",
    "Filch grabbed a quill from a pot on Filch's desk and began shuffling around looking for parchment. ",
    "\"Dung,\" Filch muttered furiously, \"great sizzling dragon bogies ... frog brains ... rat intestines ... I've had enough of it ... make an example ... where's the form ... yes ...\" ",
    "Filch retrieved a large roll of parchment from an entire drawer and stretched a large roll of parchment out in front of Filch, dipping a quill into a pot on his desk. ",
    "\" Name ... Harry Potter. Crime ...\" ",
    "\"It was only a bit of mud!\" said Harry. ",
    "\"It's only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it's an extra hour scrubbing!\" shouted Filch, a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of Filch bulbous nose. \"Crime ... befouling the castle ... suggested sentence ...\" ",
    "Dabbing at Filch streaming nose, Filch squinted unpleasantly at Harry, who waited with bated breath for Filch sentence to fall. ",
    "But as Filch lowered a quill, there was a great BANG! on the ceiling of the office, which made the oil lamp rattle. ",
    "\"PEEVES!\" Filch roared, flinging down a quill in a transport of rage. \"I'll have you this time, I'll have you!\" ",
    "And without a backward glance at Harry, Filch ran flat-footed from Filch's office, Mrs. Norris streaking alongside him. ",
    "Peeves was the school poltergeist, a grinning, airborne menace who lived to cause havoc and distress. Harry didn't much like Peeves, but couldn't help feeling grateful for Harry timing. Hopefully, whatever Peeves had done (and Peeves sounded as though Peeves'd wrecked something very big this time) would distract Filch from Harry. ",
    "Thinking that Peeves should probably wait for Filch to come back, Harry sank into a moth-eaten chair next to the desk. There was only one thing on a moth-eaten chair apart from Peeves half-completed form: a large, glossy, purple envelope with silver lettering on the front. With a quick glance at the door to check that Filch wasn't on Peeves way back, Harry picked up the envelope and read: ",
    "KWIKSPELL ",
    "A Correspondence Course in Beginners' Magic ",
    "Intrigued, Harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside. More curly silver writing on the front page said: ",
    "Feel out of step in the world of modern magic? Find yourself making excuses not to perform simple spells? Ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork? ",
    "There is an answer! ",
    "KWIKSPELL ",
    " is an all-new, fail-safe, quick-result, easy- learn course. Hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the Kwikspell method! ",
    "Madam Z. Nettles of Topsham writes: ",
    "\"I had no memory for incantations and my potions were a family joke! Now, after a KWIKSPELL ",
    " course, I am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of my Scintillation Solution!\" ",
    "Warlock D. J. Prod of Didsbury says: ",
    "\"My wife used to sneer at my feeble charms, but one month into your fabulous KWIKSPELL ",
    " course and I succeeded in turning \"My wife into a yak! ",
    "Thank you, KWIKSPELL ",
    "!\" ",
    "Fascinated, Harry thumbed through the rest of the envelope's contents. Why on earth did Filch want a KWIKSPELL ",
    " course? Did this mean Harry wasn't a proper wizard? Harry was just reading \"Lesson One: Holding Your Wand (Some Useful Tips)\" when shuffling footsteps outside told Harry Filch was coming back. Stuffing a large roll of parchment back into the envelope, Harry threw a large roll of parchment back onto the desk just as the door opened. ",
    "Filch was looking triumphant. ",
    "\"That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable!\" Harry was saying gleefully to Mrs. Norris. \"We'll have Peeves out this time, my sweet -- \" ",
    "Harry eyes fell on Harry and then darted to the Kwikspell envelope, which, Harry realized too late, was lying two feet away from where two feet had started. ",
    "Filch 's pasty face went brick red. Harry braced Harry for a tidal wave of fury. Filch hobbled across to the desk, snatched up the envelope, and threw the envelope into a drawer. ",
    "\"Have you -- did you read -- ?\" Harry sputtered. ",
    "\"No,\" Harry lied quickly. ",
    "Filch 's knobbly hands were twisting together. ",
    "\"If I thought you'd read my private -- not that it's mine -- for a friend -- be that as it may -- however -- ",
    "Harry was staring at Harry, alarmed; Filch had never looked madder. \" ",
    "His eyes were popping, a tic was going in one of Harry pouchy cheeks, and the tartan scarf didn't help. ",
    "\"Very well -- go -- and don't breathe a word -- not that -- however, if you didn't read -- go now, I have to write up Peeves report -- go -- \" ",
    "Amazed at Harry luck, Harry sped out of Filch's office, up the corridor, and back upstairs. To escape from Filch 's office without punishment was probably some kind of school record. ",
    "\"Harry! Harry! Did it work?\" ",
    "Nearly Headless Nick came gliding out of a classroom. Behind Nearly Headless Nick, Harry could see the wreckage of a large black-and-gold cabinet that appeared to have been dropped from a great height. ",
    "\"I persuaded Peeves to crash Peeves right over Filch's office,\" said Nearly Headless Nick. \"Thought Peeves might distract Nearly Headless Nick -- \" ",
    "\"Was that you?\" said Harry gratefully. \"Yeah, Peeves worked, I didn't even get detention. Thanks, Nearly Headless Nick!\" ",
    "They set off up the corridor together. Nearly Headless NickNearly Headless Nick, Harry noticed, was still holding Sir Patrick's rejection letter. ",
    "\"I wish there was something I could do for you about the Headless Hunt,\" Harry said. ",
    "Nearly Headless Nick Nearly Headless Nick stopped in Nearly Headless Nick tracks and Harry walked right through Nearly Headless Nick. Nearly Headless Nick wished Nearly Headless Nick hadn't; it was like stepping through an icy shower. ",
    "\"But there is something you could do for me,\" said Nearly Headless Nick excitedly. \"Harry -- would I be asking too much -- but no, you wouldn't want -- \" ",
    "\"What is it?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Well, this Halloween will be my five hundredth deathday,\" said Nearly Headless Nick, drawing Nearly Headless Nick up and looking dignified. ",
    "\"Oh,\" said Harry, not sure whether Nearly Headless Nick should look sorry or happy about this. \"Right.\" ",
    "\"I'm holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons. Friends will be coming from all over the country. It would be such an honor if you would attend. Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger would be most welcome, too, of course -- but I daresay you'd rather go to the school feast?\" Nearly Headless Nick watched Harry on tenterhooks. ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry quickly, \"I'll come -- \" ",
    "\"My dear boy! Harry Potter, at a party! And\" -- Nearly Headless Nick hesitated, looking excited -- \"do you think you could possibly mention to Sir Patrick how very frightening and impressive you find me?\" ",
    "\"Of -- of course,\" said Harry. ",
    "Nearly Headless Nick beamed at Sir Patrick. ",
    "\"A deathday party?\" said Hermione keenly when Harry had changed at last and joined Harry and Ron in the common room. \"I bet there aren't many living people who can say they've been to one of those -- it'll be fascinating!\" ",
    "\"Why would anyone want to celebrate the day anyone died?\" said Ron, who was halfway through his Potions homework and grumpy. \"Sounds dead depressing to Sir Patrick....\" ",
    "Rain was still lashing the windows, which were now inky black, but inside all looked bright and cheerful. The firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing homework or, in the case of Fred and George Weasley, trying to find out what would happen if you fed a Filibuster firework to a salamander. Fred had \"rescued\" the brilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard from a Care of Magical Creatures class and it was now smoldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious people. ",
    "Harry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione about Filch and the Kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air, emitting loud sparks and bangs as the salamander whirled wildly round The room. The sight of Percy bellowing Percy hoarse at Fred and George, the spectacular display of tangerine stars showering from the salamander's mouth, and the salamander escape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, drove both Filch and the Kwikspell envelope from Harry's mind. ",
    "By the time this Halloween arrived, Harry was regretting Harry rash promise to go to a party. The rest of the school was happily anticipating the school feast; the Great Hall had been decorated with the usual live bats, Hagrid's vast pumpkins had been  ",
    "carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in, and there were rumors that Dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment. ",
    "\"A promise is a promise,\" Hermione reminded Harry bossily. \"You said you'd go to a party.\" ",
    "So at seven o'clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked straight past the doorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles, and directed Ron, and Hermione steps instead toward the dungeons. ",
    "The passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick's party had been lined with candles, too, though the effect was far from cheerful: These were long, thin, jet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a dim, ghostly light even over These own living faces. The temperature dropped with every step These took. As Harry shivered and drew Harry robes tightly around Harry, Harry heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard. ",
    "\"Is that supposed to be music?\" Ron whispered. They turned a corner and saw Nearly Headless Nick Nearly Headless Nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes. ",
    "\"My dear friends,\" Harry said mournfully. \"Welcome, welcome ... so pleased you could come. ...\" ",
    "Harry swept off Harry plumed hat and bowed They inside. ",
    "It was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white, translucent people, mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor, waltzing to the dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws, played by an orchestra on a raised, black-draped platform. A chandelier overhead blazed midnight-blue  ",
    "with a thousand more black candles. They breath rose in a mist before They; it was like stepping into a freezer. ",
    "\"Shall we have a look around?\" Harry suggested, wanting to warm up Harry feet. ",
    "\"Careful not to walk through anyone,\" said Ron nervously, and they set off around the edge of a crowded dance floor. they passed a group of gloomy nuns, a ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of Ron forehead. Harry wasn't surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a gaunt, staring Slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the other ghosts. ",
    "\"Oh, no,\" said Hermione, stopping abruptly. \"Turn back, turn back, I don't want to talk to Moaning Myrtle -- \" ",
    "\"Who?\" said Harry as they backtracked quickly. ",
    "\"She haunts one of the toilets in the girls' bathroom on the first floor,\" said Hermione. ",
    "\"She haunts a toilet ?\" ",
    "\"Yes. It's been out-of-order all year because She keeps having tantrums and flooding the place. I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it; it's awful trying to have a pee with She wailing at you -- \" ",
    "\"Look, food!\" said Ron. ",
    "On the other side of The dungeon was a long table, also covered in black velvet. They approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in They tracks, ",
    "horrified. The smell was quite disgusting. Large, rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters; cakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on salvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese covered in furry green mold and, in pride of place, an enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words, ",
    "SIR NICHOLAS DE MIMSY-PORPINGTON DIED 3 1 ST OCTOBER, 1 492 ",
    "Harry watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, crouched low, and walked through the table, a portly ghost mouth held wide so that his mouth passed through one of the stinking salmon. ",
    "\"Can you taste his mouth if you walk through his mouth?\" Harry asked Harry. ",
    "\"Almost,\" said a portly ghost sadly, and a portly ghost drifted away. ",
    "\"I expect they've let it rot to give it a stronger flavor,\" said Hermione knowledgeably, pinching Hermione nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis. ",
    "\"Can we move? I feel sick,\" said Ron. ",
    "They had barely turned around, however, when a little man swooped suddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before They. ",
    "\"Hello, Peeves,\" said Harry cautiously. ",
    "Unlike the ghosts around They, Peeves was the very reverse of pale and transparent. Peeves was wearing a bright orange party hat, a revolving bow tie, and a broad grin on Peeves wide, wicked face. ",
    "\"Nibbles?\" Peeves said sweetly, offering them a bowl of peanuts covered in fungus. ",
    "\"No thanks,\" said Hermione. ",
    "\"Heard you talking about poor Myrtle,\" said Peeves, Peeves eyes dancing. \"Rude you was about poor Myrtlepoor Myrtle.\" Peeves took a deep breath and bellowed, \"OY! poor Myrtle!\" ",
    "\"Oh, no, Peeves, don't tell Peeves what I said, Peeves'll be really upset,\" Hermione whispered frantically. \"I didn't mean it, I don't mind Peeves -- er, hello, poor Myrtle.\" ",
    "The squat ghost of a girl had glided over. The squat ghost of a girl had the glummest face Harry had ever seen, half-hidden behind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles. ",
    "\"What?\" The squat ghost of a girl said sulkily. ",
    "\"How are you, poor Myrtle?\" said Hermione in a falsely bright voice. \"It's nice to see you out of the toilet.\" ",
    "poor Myrtle sniffed. ",
    "\"Miss Granger was just talking about you -- \" said Peeves slyly in poor Myrtle's ear. ",
    "\"Just saying -- saying -- how nice you look tonight,\" said Hermione, glaring at Peeves. ",
    "poor Myrtle eyed Hermione suspiciously. ",
    "\"You're making fun of you,\" Peeves said, silver tears welling rapidly in Peeves small, see-through eyes. ",
    "\"No -- honestly -- didn't I just say how nice poor Myrtle's looking?\" said Hermione, nudging Harry and Ron painfully in the ribs. ",
    "\"Oh, yeah -- \" ",
    "\"Peeves did -- \" ",
    "\"Don't lie to you,\" poor Myrtle gasped, tears now flooding down Peeves face, while Peeves chuckled happily over Peeves shoulder. \"D'you think I don't know what people call me behind my back? Fat Myrtle! Ugly Myrtle! Miserable, moaning, moping poor Myrtle!\" ",
    "\"You've forgotten pimply,\" Peeves hissed in her ear. ",
    "Moaning Myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from The dungeon. Peeves shot after her, pelting her with moldy peanuts, yelling, \"Pimply\\ Pimplyl\" ",
    "\"Oh, dear,\" said Hermione sadly. ",
    "Nearly Headless Nick now drifted toward Nearly Headless Nick through the crowd. ",
    "\"Enjoying yourselves?\" ",
    "\"Oh, yes,\" Nearly Headless Nick lied. ",
    "\"Not a bad turnout,\" said Nearly Headless Nick proudly. \"The Wailing Widow came all the way up from Kent. ... It's nearly time for my speech, I'd better go and warn the orchestra. ...\" ",
    "the orchestra, however, stopped playing at that very moment. the orchestra, and everyone else in The dungeon, fell silent, looking around in excitement, as a hunting horn sounded. ",
    "\"Oh, here we go,\" said Nearly Headless Nick bitterly. ",
    "Through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses, each ridden by a headless horseman. The ",

",
    "\"Nick!\" his roared. \"How are you? his bearded head still hanging in there?\" ",
    "his bearded head gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless Nick on the shoulder. ",
    "\"Welcome, his bearded head,\" said Nearly Headless Nick stiffly. ",
    "\"Live 'uns!\" said his bearded head, spotting Harry, Ron, and Hermione and giving a huge, fake jump of astonishment, so that his bearded head fell off again (the crowd howled with laughter). ",
    "\"Very amusing,\" said Nearly Headless Nick darkly. ",
    "\"Don't mind Nearly Headless Nick!\" shouted his bearded head from a crowded dance floor. \"Still upset we won't let his bearded head join the Hunt! But I mean to say -- look at the fellow -- \" ",
    "\"I think,\" said Harry, at a meaningful look from Nearly Headless Nick, \"Nearly Headless Nick's very -- frightening and -- er -- \" ",
    "\"Ha!\" yelled his bearded head. \"Bet Bet asked you to say that!\" ",
    "\"If I could have everyone's attention, it's time for my speech!\" said Nearly Headless Nick loudly, striding ",
    "toward the podium and climbing into an icy blue spotlight. ",
    "\"My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great sorrow ...\" ",
    "But nobody heard much more. Sir Patrick and the rest of the Hunt had just started a game of Head Hockey and the crowd were turning to watch. Nearly Headless Nick tried vainly to recapture Nearly Headless Nick audience, but gave up as his bearded head went sailing past his bearded head to loud cheers. ",
    "Harry was very cold by now, not to mention hungry. ",
    "\"I can't stand much more of this,\" Ron muttered, Ron teeth chattering, as the orchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto a crowded dance floor. ",
    "\"Let's go,\" Harry agreed. ",
    "They backed toward the door, nodding and beaming at anyone who looked at They, and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full of black candles. ",
    "\"Pudding might not be finished yet,\" said Ron hopefully, leading the way toward the steps to the entrance hall. ",
    "And then Harry heard \"Pudding. ",
    "\"... rip ... tear ... kill ...\" ",
    "It was the same voice, the same cold, murderous voice Ron had heard in Lockhart's office. ",
    "Ron stumbled to a halt, clutching at the dungeon wall, listening with all Ron might, looking around, squinting up and down the passageway full of black candles. ",
    "HarryHarry, what're you -- ?\" ",
    "\"It's that voice again -- shut up a minute -- \" ",
    "soo hungry ... for so long ...\" ",
    "\"Listen!\" said Harry urgently, and Ron and Hermione froze, watching Harry. ",
    "\"... kill ... time to kill ...\" ",
    "that voice was growing fainter. Harry was sure that voice was moving away -- moving upward. A mixture of fear and excitement gripped Harry as Harry stared at the dark ceiling; how could that voice be moving upward? Was that voice a phantom, to whom stone ceilings didn't matter? ",
    "\"This way,\" Harry shouted, and Harry began to run, up the stairs, into the entrance hall. It was no good hoping to hear anything here, the babble of talk from the Halloween feast was echoing out of the entrance hall. Harry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor, Ron and Hermione clattering behind Ron. ",
    "HarryHarry, what're Ron and Hermione -- \" ",
    "\"SHH!\" ",
    "Harry strained Harry ears. Distantly, from the floor above, and growing fainter still, Harry heard that voice: \"...I smell blood. ...I SMELL BLOOD\\\" ",
    "Harry stomach lurched -- ",
    "\"It's going to kill someone!\" Harry shouted, and ignoring Ron's and Hermione's bewildered faces, Harry ran up the next flight of steps three at a time, trying to listen over Harry own pounding footsteps -- ",
    "Harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor, Ron and Hermione panting behind Harry, not stopping until Ron and Hermione panting behind him turned a corner into the last, deserted passage. ",
    "HarryHarry, what was that all about?\" said Ron, wiping sweat off Ron face. \"I couldn't hear anything. ...\" ",
    "But Hermione gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the corridor. ",
    "\"Loo c!\" ",
    "Something was shining on the dungeon wall ahead. Ron and Hermione panting behind him approached slowly, squinting through the darkness. Foot-high words had been daubed on the wall between two windows, shimmering in the light cast by the flaming torches. ",
    "THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED. ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE. ",
    "\"What's that thing -- hanging underneath?\" said Ron, a slight quiver in Ron voice. ",
    "As they edged nearer, Harry almost slipped -- there was a large puddle of water on the first floor; Ron and Hermione grabbed Ron, and Ron and Hermione inched toward the message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it. All three of Ron and Hermione realized what it was at once, and leapt backward with a splash. ",
    "Mrs. Norris, the caretaker's cat, was hanging by her tail from the torch bracket. her was stiff as a board, her eyes wide and staring. ",
    "For a few seconds, they didn't move. Then Ron said, \"Let's get out of here.\" ",
    "\"Shouldn't they try and help -- Harry Harry began awkwardly. ",
    "\"Trust me,\" said Ron. \"they don't want to be found here.\" ",
    "But it was too late. A rumble, as though of distant thunder, told A rumble, as though of distant thunder that the Halloween feast had just ended. From either end of the corridor where A rumble, as though of distant thunder stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs, and the loud, happy talk of well-fed people; next moment, students were crashing into the passage from both ends. ",
    "The chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted the hanging cat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight. ",
    "Then someone shouted through the quiet. ",
    "\"Enemies of the Heir, beware! You'll be next, Mudbloods!\" ",
    "It was Draco Malfoy. Draco Malfoy had pushed to the front of the crowd, Draco Malfoy cold eyes alive, Draco Malfoy usually bloodless face flushed, as Draco Malfoy grinned at the sight of the hanging, immobile cat. ",

    "\"What's going on here? What's going on?\" ",
    "Attracted no doubt by Draco Malfoy's shout, Argus Filch came shouldering Argus Filch way through the crowd. Then Draco Malfoy saw Mrs. Norris and fell back, clutching his usually bloodless face. ",
    "\"My cat! My cat! What's happened to Mrs. Norris?\" Draco Malfoy shrieked. ",
    "And his cold eyes fell on Harry. ",
    "\"You!\" Draco Malfoy screeched. \"You! You've murdered My cat! You've killed Mrs. Norris! I'll kill you! I'll -- \" ",
    "\"Argus'.\" ",
    "Dumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of other teachers. In seconds, Dumbledore had swept past Harry, Ron, and Hermione and detached Mrs. Norris from the torch bracket. ",
    "\"Come with me, Argus,\" Dumbledore said to Argus Filch. \"You, too, ",
    "Mr. Potter, Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger.\" ",
    "Lockhart stepped forward eagerly. ",
    "\"Lockhart's office is nearest, Headmaster -- just upstairs -- please feel free -- \" ",
    "\"Thank you, Gilderoy,\" said Dumbledore. ",
    "the crowd parted to let the crowd pass. Lockhart, looking excited and important, hurried after Dumbledore; so did Professors McGonagall and Snape. ",
    "As the crowd entered Lockhart's darkened office there was a flurry of movement across the walls; Harry saw several of the Lockharts in the pictures dodging out of sight, the crowd hair in rollers. Lockhart Lockhart lit the candles on Lockhart desk and stood back. Dumbledore laid Mrs. Norris on the polished surface and began to examine Mrs. Norris. Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of candlelight, watching. ",
    "The tip of Dumbledore 's long, crooked nose was barely an inch from Mrs. Norris's fur. Dumbledore was looking at Mrs. Norris closely through Dumbledore half-moon spectacles, Dumbledore long fingers gently prodding and poking. Professors McGonagall was bent almost as close, Professors McGonagall narrowed. Snape loomed behind them, half in shadow, wearing a most peculiar expression: It was as though Snape was trying hard not to smile. And Lockhart was hovering around all of them, making suggestions. ",
    "\"It was definitely a curse that killed Mrs. Norris -- probably the Trans-mogrifian Torture -- I've seen It was definitely a curse that killed her -- probably the Trans-mogrifian Torture used many ",

    "Lockhart's comments were punctuated by Argus Filch 's dry, racking sobs. Lockhart was slumped in a chair by his desk, unable to look at Mrs. Norris, Lockhart face in Lockhart hands. Much as Lockhart detested Filch, Harry couldn't help feeling a bit sorry for Harry, though not nearly as sorry as Harry felt for Harry. If Dumbledore believed Filch, Harry would be expelled for sure. ",
    "Dumbledore was now muttering strange words under Dumbledore breath and tapping Mrs. Norris with Dumbledore wand but nothing happened: Mrs. Norris continued to look as though Mrs. Norris had been recently stuffed. ",
    "\"... I remember something very similar happening in Ouagadougou,\" said Lockhart, \"a series of attacks, the full story's in my autobiography, I was able to provide the townsfolk with various amulets, which cleared the matter up at once. ...\" ",
    "The photographs of Lockhart on the walls were all nodding in agreement as Lockhart talked. One of The photographs of Lockhart on the walls had forgotten to remove Lockhart hair net. ",
    "At Dumbledore Dumbledore straightened up. ",
    "\"She's not dead, Argus,\" Dumbledore said softly. ",
    "Lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of murders Lockhart had prevented. ",
    "\"Not dead?\" choked Argus Filch, looking through Lockhart fingers at Mrs. Norris. \"But why's she all -- all stiff and frozen?\" ",
    "\"she has been Petrified,\" said Dumbledore\"Ah! I thought so!\" said Lockhart). \"But how, I cannot say. ",
    "\"Ask him\\\" shrieked Argus Filch, turning Argus Filch blotched and tearstained face to Harry. ",
    "\"No second year could have done this,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"It would take Dark Magic of the most advanced -- \" ",
    "\"Dumbledore did it, Dumbledore did it!\" Filch spat, Dumbledore pouchy face purpling. \"You saw what Dumbledore wrote on the dungeon wall! Dumbledore found -- in Lockhart's office -- Dumbledore knows I'm a -- I'm a -- \" Filch 's face worked horribly. \"Dumbledore knows I'm a Squib!\" Dumbledore finished. ",
    "\"I never touched Mrs. Norris!\" Harry said loudly, uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at Harry, including all the Lockharts on the walls. \"And I don't even know what a Squib is.\" ",
    "\"Rubbish!\" snarled Argus Filch. \"Harry saw my Kwikspell letter!\" ",
    "\"If I might speak, Headmaster,\" said Snape from the shadows, and Harry's sense of foreboding increased; Harry was sure nothing Snape had to say was going to do Harry any good. ",
    "\"Potter and Harry friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" Harry said, a slight sneer curling Harry mouth as though Harry doubted it. \"But we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here. Why was Harry in the upstairs corridor at all? Why wasn't Harry at the Halloween feast?\" ",
    "Harry, Ron and Hermione all launched into an explanation about the deathday party. \"... there were hundreds of ghosts, hundreds of ghosts'll tell you we were there -- \" ",
    "\"But why not join the Halloween feast afterward?\" said Snape, Harry black eyes glittering in the candlelight. \"Why go up to the upstairs corridor?\" ",
    "Ron and Hermione looked at Harry. ",
    "\"Because -- because -- \" Harry said, Harry heart thumping very fast; something told Harry his heart would sound very far-fetched if Harry told \" ",
    "Ron and Hermione Harry had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but Harry could hear, \"because we were tired and wanted to go to bed,\" Harry said. ",
    "\"Without any supper?\" said Snape, a triumphant smile flickering across Harry gaunt face. \"I didn't think ghosts provided food fit for living people at ghosts parties.\" ",
    "\"We weren't hungry,\" said Ron loudly as Ron stomach gave a huge rumble. ",
    "Snape's nasty smile widened. ",
    "\"I suggest, Headmaster, that Potter is not being entirely truthful,\" Potter said. \"It might be a good idea if Potter were deprived of certain privileges until Potter is ready to tell we the whole story. I personally feel Potter should be taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch team until Potter is ready to be honest.\" ",
    "\"Really, Severus,\" said Professors McGonagall sharply, \"I see no reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch. This cat wasn't hit over the head with a broomstick. There is no evidence at all that Potter has done anything wrong.\" ",
    "Dumbledore was giving Harry a searching look. Dumbledore twinkling light-blue gaze made Harry feel as though Dumbledore were being X-rayed. ",
    "\"Innocent until proven guilty, Severus,\" Severus said firmly. ",
    "Snape looked furious. So did Argus Filch. ",
    "\"This cat has been Petrified!\" Snape shrieked, Snape eyes popping. \"I want to see some punishmenti\" ",
    "\"We will be able to cure Snape, Argus,\" said Dumbledore patiently. \"Professer Sprout recently managed to procure some Mandrakes. As soon as Professer Sprout have reached Professer Sprout full size, I will have a potion made that will revive Mrs. Norris.\" ",
    "\"I'll make it,\" Lockhart butted in. \"I must have done it a hundred times. I could whip up a Mandrake Restorative Draught in my sleep -- \" ",
    "\"Excuse me,\" said Snape icily. \"But I believe I am the Potions master at this school.\" ",
    "There was a very awkward pause. ",
    "\"You may go,Dumbledore Dumbledore said to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. ",
    "Harry, Ron, and Hermione went, as quickly as Harry, Ron, and Hermione could without actually running. When Harry, Ron, and Hermione were a floor up from Lockhart's office, Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned into an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Harry squinted at Harry friends' darkened faces. ",
    "\"D'you think I should have told them about that voice I heard?\" ",
    "\"No,\" said Ron, without hesitation. \"Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world.\" ",
    "Something in Ron's voice made Harry ask, \"You do believe me, don't you?\" ",
    "\" 'Course I do,\" said Ron quickly. \"But -- you must admit it's weird. ...\" ",
    "\"I know it's weird,\" said Harry. \"The whole thing's weird. What was that writing on the dungeon wall about? The Chamber Has Been Opened'. ... What's that supposed to mean?\" ",
    "\"You know, it rings a sort of bell,\" said Ron slowly. \"I think someone told me a story about a secret chamber at Hogwarts once ... might've been Bill. ...\" ",
    "\"And what on earth's a Squib?\" said Harry. ",
    "To Bill surprise, Ron stifled a snigger. ",
    "\"Well -- it's not funny really -- but as it's Filch,\" Bill said. \"A Squib is someone who was born into a wizarding family but hasn't got any magic powers. Kind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards, but Squibs are quite unusual. If Filch 's trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course, I reckon Filch must be a Squib. It would explain a lot. Like why Filch hates students so much.\" Ron gave a satisfied smile. \"Ron's bitter.\" ",
    "A clock chimed somewhere. ",
    "\"Midnight,\" said Harry. \"We'd better get to bed before Snape comes along and tries to frame We for something else.\" ",
    "For a few days, this school could talk of little else but the attack on Mrs. Norris. Argus Filch kept the attack on Mrs. Norris fresh in everyone's minds by pacing the spot where Argus Filch had been attacked, as though Argus Filch thought the attacker might come back. Harry had seen Harry scrubbing the message on the wall with Mrs. Skower's All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but to no effect; the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone. When Argus Filch wasn't guarding the scene of the crime, Argus Filch was skulking red-eyed through the corridors, lunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put unsuspecting students in detention for things like \"breathing loudly\" and \"looking happy.\" ",
    "Ginny Weasley seemed very disturbed by Mrs. Norris's fate. According to Ron, Ginny Weasley was a great cat lover. ",
    "\"But you haven't really got to know Mrs. Norris,Ron Ron told Ginny Weasley bracingly. \"Honestly, we're much better off without Ginny Weasley.\" Ginny 's lip trembled. \"Stuff like this doesn't often happen at Hogwarts,Ron Ron assured Ginny Weasley. \"They'll catch the maniac who did it and have Ron out of here in no time. I just hope Ron's got time to Argus Filch before Ron's expelled. I'm only joking -- Ron Ron added hastily as Ginny blanched. ",
    "the attack on Mrs. Norris had also had an effect on Hermione. the attack on Mrs. Norris was quite usual for Hermione to spend a lot of time reading, but Hermione was now doing almost nothing else. Nor could Harry and Ron get much response from Hermione when Harry and Ron asked what Hermione was up to, and not until the following Wednesday did Harry and Ron find out. ",
    "Harry had been held back in Potions, where Snape had made Harry stay behind to scrape tubeworms off ",
    "the desks. After a hurried lunch, Harry went upstairs to meet Ron in the library, and saw Justin Finch- Fletchley, the Hufflepuff boy from Herbology, coming toward Harry. Harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when Justin caught sight of Justin, turned abruptly, and sped off in the opposite direction. ",
    "Harry found Ron at the back of the library, measuring Harry History of Magic homework. Harry had asked for a three-foot-long composition on \"The Medieval Assembly of European Wizards.\" ",
    "\"I don't believe it, I'm still eight inches short. ...\" said Ron furiously, letting go of Ron parchment, which sprang back into a roll. \"And Hermione's done four feet seven inches and Hermione writing's tiny.\" ",
    "\"Where is Hermione?\" asked Harry, grabbing the tape measure and unrolling Harry own homework. ",
    "\"Somewhere over there,\" said Ron, pointing along the shelves. \"Looking for another book. I think Hermione's trying to read the library before Christmas.\" ",
    "Harry told Ron about Justin Finch-Fletchley running away from Ron. ",
    "\"Dunno why you care. I thought Harry was a bit of an idiot,\" said Ron, scribbling away, making Harry writing as large as possible. \"All that junk about Lockhart being so great -- \" ",
    "Hermione emerged from between the bookshelves. ",
    "Hermione looked irritable and at last seemed ready to talk to All that junk about Lockhart being so great -- \" ",
    "Hermione emerged from between the bookshelves. ",
    "\"All the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken out,\" Hermione said, sitting down next to Harry and Ron. \"And there's a two-week waiting list. I wish I hadn't ",
    "left my copy at home, but I couldn't fit my copy in my trunk with all the Lockhart books.\" ",
    "\"Why do you want my copy?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"The same reason everyone else wants it,\" said Hermione, \"to read up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets.\" ",
    "\"What's that?\" said Harry quickly. ",
    "\"That's just it. I can't remember,\" said Hermione, biting Hermione lip. \"And I can't find the story anywhere else -- \" ",
    "\"Hermione, let me read your composition,\" said Ron desperately, checking Ron watch. ",
    "\"No, I won't,\" said Hermione, suddenly severe. \"You've had ten days to finish it -- \" ",
    "\"I only need another two inches, come on -- \" ",
    "The bell rang. \" ",
    "Ron and Hermione Hermione led the way to History of Magic, bickering. ",
    "History of Magic Magic was the dullest subject on \" ",
    "Ron and Hermione schedule. Professor Binns, who taught it, was Professor Binns, who taught it only ghost teacher, and the most exciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering the room through the blackboard. Ancient and shriveled, many people said his hadn't noticed his was dead. his had simply got up to teach one day and left his body behind his in an armchair in front of the staffroom fire; his routine had not varied in the slightest since.

    "Today was as boring as ever. Harry opened Harry notes and began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class was ",
    "in a deep stupor, occasionally coming to long enough to copy down a name or date, then falling asleep again. Harry had been speaking for half an hour when something happened that had never happened before. Hermione put up her hand. ",
    "Harry, glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lecture on the International Warlock Convention of 1289, looked amazed. ",
    "\"Miss -- er -- ?\" ",
    "\"Granger, Professor. I was wondering if you could tell us anything about the Chamber of Secrets,\" said Hermione in a clear voice. ",
    "Dean Thomas, who had been sitting with his hanging open, gazing out of the window, jerked out of his trance; Lavender Brown's head came up off Lavender Brown's arms and Neville Longbottom's elbow slipped off Neville Longbottom's desk. ",
    "Harry blinked. ",
    "\"My subject is History of Magic,\" Harry said in Harry dry, wheezy voice. \"I deal with, facts, Miss Granger, not myths and legends.\" Harry cleared Harry throat with a small noise like chalk snapping and continued, \"In September of that year, a subcommittee of Sardinian sorcerers -- \" ",
    "Harry stuttered to a halt. Hermione's hand was waving in the air again. ",
    "\"Miss Grant?\" ",
    "\"Please, Harry, don't legends always have a basis in fact?\" ",
    "Harry was looking at Harry in such amazement, Harry was sure no student had ever interrupted Harry before, alive or dead. ",
    "\"Well,\" said Harry Harry slowly, \"yes, one could argue that, I suppose.\" Harry peered at Hermione as though Harry had never seen a student properly before. \"However, the legend of which you speak is such a very sensational, even ludicrous tale -- \" ",
    "But the whole class was now hanging on Harry 's every word. Harry looked dimly at them all, every face turned to Harry. Harry could tell Harry was completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest. ",
    "\"Oh, very well,\" Harry said slowly. \"Let me see ... the Chamber of Secrets . . . ",
    "\"You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago -- the precise date is uncertain -- by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age. The four school Houses are named after the four greatest witches and wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. the four greatest witches and wizards of the age built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for this castle was an age when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered much persecution.\" ",
    "Harry paused, gazed blearily around the room, and continued. ",
    "\"For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to this castle to be educated. But then disagreements sprang up between them. A rift began to grow between Slytherin and the others. Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. Slytherin believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic  ",
    "families. Slytherin disliked taking students of Muggle parentage, believing students of Muggle parentage to be untrustworthy. After a while, there was a serious argument on the subject between Slytherin and Gryffindor, and Slytherin left this school.\" ",
    "Harry paused again, pursing Harry lips, looking like a wrinkled old tortoise. ",
    "\"Reliable historical sources tell us this much,\" Harry said. \"But these honest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the Chamber of Secrets. The story goes that Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle, of which the founders knew nothing. ",
    "\"Slytherin, according to the fanciful legend of the Chamber of Secrets, sealed the Chamber of Secrets Secrets so that none would be able to open the Chamber of Secrets until Secrets own true heir arrived at this school. his own true heir would be able to unseal the Chamber of SecretsSecrets, unleash the horror within, and use the Chamber of Secrets to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic.\" ",
    "There was silence as he finished telling The story, but it wasn't the usual, sleepy silence that filled Harry 's classes. There was unease in the air as everyone continued to watch he, hoping for more. Harry Harry looked faintly annoyed. ",
    "\"The whole thing is arrant nonsense, of course,\" Harry said. \"Naturally, this school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber, many times, by the most learned witches and wizards. It does not exist. A tale told to frighten the gullible.\" ",
    "Hermione's hand was back in the air. ",
    "\"Sir -- what exactly do you mean by the 'horror within' the Chamber of Secrets?\" ",
    "\"That is believed to be some sort of monster, which the Heir of Slytherin alone can control,\" said Professor Harry in he dry, reedy voice. ",
    "the whole class exchanged nervous looks. ",
    "\"I tell you, The whole thing does not exist,\" said Harry, shuffling his notes. \"There is no Chamber and no monster.\" ",
    "\"But, Harry,\" said Seamus Finnigan, \"if the Chamber of Secrets can only be opened by Slytherin's true heir, no one else would be able to find it, would no one else?\" ",
    "\"Nonsense, O'Flaherty,\" said Harry in an aggravated tone. \"If a long succession of Hogwarts headmasters and headmistresses haven't found the thing -- \" ",
    "\"But, Harry,\" piped up Parvati Patil, \"you'd probably have to use Dark Magic to open it -- \" ",
    "\"Just because a wizard doesn't use Dark Magic doesn't mean a wizard can't, Miss Pennyfeather,\" snapped HarryHarry. \"I repeat, if the likes of Dumbledore ",
    "\"But maybe you've got to be related to Slytherin, so Dumbledore couldn't -- \" began Dean Thomas, but Harry Harry had had enough. ",
    "\"That will do,\" Harry said sharply. \"It is a myth! It does not exist! There is not a shred of evidence that Slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard! I regret telling you such a foolish story! We ",
    "will return, if you please, to history, to solid, believable, verifiable facti\" ",
    "And within five minutes, the whole class had sunk back into the whole class usual torpor. ",
    "\"I always knew Slytherin was a twisted old loony,\" Ron told Harry and Ron as Harry and Ron fought Harry and Ron way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off Harry and Ron bags before dinner. \"But I never knew Slytherin started all this pure-blood stuff. I wouldn't be in Slytherin House if you paid me. Honestly, if the Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin, I'd've got the train straight back home. ...\" ",
    "Hermione nodded fervently, but Harry didn't say anything. Harry stomach had just dropped unpleasantly. ",
    "Harry had never told \" ",
    "Ron and Hermione Hermione that the Sorting Hat had seriously considered putting Harry in Slytherin. Harry could remember, as though it were yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in Harry ear when Harry'd placed the Sorting Hat on Harry head a year before: You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin would help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that. . . . ",
    "But Harry, who had already heard of his House reputation for turning out Dark wizards, had thought desperately, Slytherin ! and the Sorting Hat had said, Oh, well, if you're sure ... better be Gryffindor. ... ",
    "As they were shunted along in the throng, Colin Creevey went past. ",
    "\"Hiya, Harry!\" ",
    "\"Hullo, Colin,\" said Harry automatically. ",
    "\"Harry -- Harry -- a boy in my class has been saying you're -- \" ",
    "But Colin was so small Colin couldn't fight against the tide of people bearing Colin toward the Great Hall; they heard Colin squeak, \"See you, Harry!\" and Colin was gone. ",
    "\"What's a boy in my class saying about Colin?\" Hermione wondered. ",
    "\"That I'm Slytherin's heir, I expect,\" said Harry, Harry stomach dropping another inch or so as Harry suddenly remembered the way Justin Finch-Fletchley had run away from Harry at lunchtime. ",
    "\"People here'll believe anything,\" said Ron in disgust. ",
    "The crowd thinned and The crowd were able to climb the next staircase without difficulty. ",
    "\"D'you really think there's a Chamber of Secrets?\" ",
    "Ron asked Hermione. ",
    "\"I don't know,\" Hermione said, frowning. \"Dumbledore couldn't cure Mrs. Norris, and that makes me think that whatever attacked Mrs. Norris might not be -- well -- human.\" ",
    "As Mrs. Norris spoke, they turned a corner and found they at the end of the very corridor where the attack had happened. they stopped and looked. The scene was just as The scene had been that night, except that there was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket, and an empty chair stood against the wall bearing the message \"The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened.\" ",
    "\"That's where Filch has been keeping guard,\" Ron muttered. ",
    "they looked at each other. The corridor was deserted. ",
    "\"Can't hurt to have a poke around,\" said Harry, dropping Harry bag and getting to Harry hands and knees so that Harry could crawl along, searching for clues. ",
    "\"Scorch marks!\" Harry said. \"Here -- and here -- \" ",
    "\"Come and look at this!\" said Hermione. \"This is funny. ...\" ",
    "Harry got up and crossed to the window next to the message on the wall. Hermione was pointing at the topmost pane, where around twenty spiders were scuttling, apparently fighting to get through a small crack. A long, silvery thread was dangling like a rope, as though A long, silvery thread had all climbed it in A long, silvery thread hurry to get outside. ",
    "\"Have you ever seen spiders act like that?\" said Hermione wonderingly. ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry, \"have you, Ron? Ron?\" ",
    "Ron looked over Ron shoulder. Ron was standing well back and seemed to be fighting the impulse to run. ",
    "\"What's up?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"I -- don't -- like -- spiders,\" said Ron tensely. ",
    "\"I never knew that,\" said Hermione, looking at Ron in surprise. \"You've used spiders in Potions loads of times. ...\" ",
    "\"I don't mind spiders in Potions loads of times dead,\" said Ron, who was carefully looking anywhere but at the window next to the message on the wall. \"I just don't like the way spiders in Potions loads of times move. ...\" ",
    "Hermione giggled. ",
    "\"It's not funny,\" said Ron, fiercely. \"If you must know, when I was three, Fred turned my -- my teddy bear into a great big filthy spider because I broke Ron toy broomstick. ... You wouldn't like you must know, when I was three, Fred turned my -- my teddy bear into a great big filthy spider because I broke his toy broomstick either if you'd been holding your bear and suddenly your bear had too many legs and ...\" ",
    "Ron broke off, shuddering. Hermione was obviously still trying not to laugh. Feeling you must know, when I was three, Fred turned my -- my teddy bear into a great big filthy spider because I broke his toy broomstick had better get off the subject, Harry said, \"Remember all that water on the floor? Where did that come from? Someone's mopped all that water up.\" ",
    "\"It was about here,\" said Ron, recovering Ron to walk a few paces past Filch's chair and pointing. ",
    "\"Level with this door.\" ",
    "Ron reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew Ron hand as though Ron'd been burned. ",
    "\"What's the matter?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Can't go in there,\" said Ron gruffly. \"That's a girls' toilet.\" ",
    "\"Oh, Ron, there won't be anyone in there,\" said Hermione, standing up and coming over. \"That's Moaning Myrtle's place. Come on, let's have a look.\" ",
    "And ignoring the large OUT OF ORDER sign, she opened this door. ",
    "It was the gloomiest, most depressing bathroom Harry had ever set foot in. Under a large, cracked, and spotted mirror were a row of chipped sinks. the floor was damp and reflected the dull light given off by the stubs of a few candles, burning low in the stubs of a few candles holders;  ",
    "the wooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one of the stubs of a few candles was dangling off the stubs of a few candles hinges. ",
    "Hermione put Hermione fingers to Hermione lips and set off toward the end stall. When Hermione reached it Hermione said, \"Hello, Myrtle, how are you?\" ",
    "Harry and Ron went to look. Moaning Myrtle was floating above the tank of the toilet, picking a spot on Hermione chin. ",
    "\"This is a girls' bathroom,\" Hermione said, eyeing \" ",
    "Harry and Ron suspiciously. \"\" ",
    "Harry and Ron're not girls.\" ",
    "\"No,\" Hermione agreed. \"I just wanted to show \" ",
    "Harry and Ron how -- er -- nice it is in here.\" ",
    "Hermione waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor. ",
    "\"Ask Hermione if Hermione saw anything,Harry Harry mouthed at Hermione. ",
    "\"What are you whispering?\" said Myrtle, staring at Harry. ",
    "\"Nothing,\" said Harry quickly. \"We wanted to ask -- \" ",
    "\"I wish people would stop talking behind my back!\" said Myrtle, in a voice choked with tears. \"I do have feelings, you know, even if I am dead -- \" ",
    "\"Myrtle, no one wants to upset you,\" said Hermione. \"Harry -- \" ",
    "\"No one wants to upset me! That's a good one!\" howled Myrtle. \"My life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along ruining my death!\" ",
    "\"We wanted to ask you if you've seen anything funny lately,\" said Hermione quickly. \"Because a cat was attacked right outside your front door on Halloween.\" ",
    "\"Did you see anyone near here that night?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"I wasn't paying attention,\" said Myrtle dramatically. \"Peeves upset me so much I came in here and tried to kill That. Then, of course, I remembered that I'm -- that I'm -- \" ",
    "\"Already dead,\" said Ron helpfully. ",
    "Myrtle gave a tragic sob, rose up in the air, turned over, and dived headfirst into the toilet, splashing water all over them and vanishing from sight, although from the direction of her muffled sobs, her had come to rest somewhere in the U-bend. ",
    "Harry and Ron stood with Harry and Ron mouths open, but Hermione shrugged wearily and said, \"Honestly, that was almost cheerful for Myrtle. ... Come on, let's go.\" ",
    "Harry had barely closed the door on Myrtle's gurgling sobs when a loud voice made all three of them jump. ",

    "\"That's what I told Ginny,\" said \" ",
    "Percy fiercely, \"but Ginny still seems to think you're going to be expelled, ",

    "\"Who can it be, though?\" she said in a quiet voice, as though continuing a conversation they had just been having. \"Who'd want to frighten all the Squibs and Muggle-borns out of Hogwarts?\" ",

    "\"Well,\" said Hermione cautiously, \"I suppose it's possible. ...\" ",
    "\"But how do we prove it?\" said Harry darkly. ",
    "\"There might be a way,\" said Hermione slowly, dropping Hermione voice still further with a quick glance across the room at \" ",
    "Percy. \"Of course, it would be difficult. And dangerous, very dangerous. we'd be breaking about fifty school rules, I expect -- \" ",
    "\"If, in a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let we know, won't you?\" said Ron irritably. ",
    "\"All right,\" said Hermione coldly. \"What we'd need to do is to get inside the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without Malfoy realizing it's we.\" ",
    "\"But that's impossible,\" Harry said as Ron laughed. ",
    "\"No, it's not,\" said Hermione. \"All we'd need would be some Polyjuice Potion.\" ",
    "\"What's that?\" said Ron and Harry together. ",
    "\"Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago -- \" ",
    "\"D'you think Ron and Harry together've got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to Snape?\" muttered Ron. ",
    "\"It transforms you into somebody else. Think about It! Ron and Harry together could change into three of the Slytherins. No one would know it was Ron and Harry together. Malfoy would probably tell Ron and Harry together anything. Malfoy's probably boasting about it in the Slytherin common room right now, if only Ron and Harry together could hear Malfoy.\" ",
    "\"This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,\" said Ron, frowning. \"What if Ron and Harry together were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever?\" ",
    "\"It wears off after a while,\" said Hermione, waving her hand impatiently. \"But getting hold of the recipe will ",
    "be very difficult. Snape said it was in a book called Moste Potente Potions and it's bound to be in the Restricted Section of the library.\" ",
    "There was only one way to get out a book from the Restricted Section of the library: You needed a signed note of permission from a teacher. ",

    "Since the disastrous episode of the pixies, Professor Lockhart had not brought live creatures to class. Instead, Professor Lockhart read passages from Professor Lockhart books to live creatures, and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramatic bits. Professor Lockhart usually picked Harry to help Professor Lockhart with these reconstructions; so far, Harry had been forced to play a simple Transylvanian villager whom Professor Lockhart had cured of a Babbling Curse, a yeti with a head cold, and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything except lettuce since Professor Lockhart had dealt with Professor Lockhart. ",
    "Harry was hauled to the front of the class during their very next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson, this time acting a werewolf. If Harry hadn't had a very good reason for keeping Professor Lockhart in a good mood, Harry would have refused to do it. ",
    "\"Nice loud howl, Harry -- exactly -- and then, if you'll believe it, I pounced -- like this -- slammed Harry to the floor -- thus -- with one hand, I managed to hold Harry down -- with my other, I put my wand to Harry throat -- I then screwed up my remaining strength  ",
    "and performed the immensely complex Homorphus Charm -- Harry let out a piteous moan -- go on, Harry -- higher than that -- good -- the fur vanished -- the fangs shrank -- and Harry turned back into a man. Simple, yet effective -- and another village will remember me forever as the hero who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolf attacks.\" ",
    "The bell rang and Professor Lockhart got to Professor Lockhart feet. ",
    "\"Homework -- compose a poem about my defeat of the Wagga Wagga Werewolf! Signed copies of Magical Me to the author of the best one!\" ",
    "the class began to leave. Harry returned to the back of the room, where Ron and Hermione were waiting. ",
    "\"Ready?\" Harry muttered. ",
    "\"Wait till everyone's gone,\" said Hermione nervously. \"All right ...\" ",
    "She approached Professor Lockhart's desk, a piece of paper clutched tightly in She hand, Harry and Ron right behind She. ",
    "\"Er -- Professor Lockhart?\" Hermione stammered. \"I wanted to -- to get a book called Moste Potente Potions out of the library. Just for background reading.\" She held out the piece of paper, She hand shaking slightly. \"But the thing is, it's in the Restricted Section of the librarythe library, so I need a teacher to sign for it -- I'm sure it would help me understand what you say in Gadding with Ghouls about slow-acting venoms -- \" ",
    "\"Ah, Gadding with GhoulsV' said Professor Lockhart, taking the note from Hermione and smiling widely at Hermione. \"a book called Moste Potente Potions. You enjoyed it?\" ",
    "\"Oh, yes,\" said Hermione eagerly. \"So clever, the way you trapped that last one with the tea-strainer -- \" ",
    "\"Well, I'm sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the year a little extra help,\" said Professor Lockhart warmly, and Professor Lockhart pulled out an enormous peacock quill. \"Yes, nice, isn't it?\" Professor Lockhart said, misreading the revolted look on Ron's face. \"I usually save it for book signings.\" ",
    "Professor Lockhart scrawled an enormous loopy signature on the note and handed an enormous loopy signature back to Hermione. ",
    "\"So, Harry,\" said Professor Lockhart, while Hermione folded the note with fumbling fingers and slipped an enormous loopy signature into Hermione bag. \"Tomorrow's the first Quidditch match of the season, I believe? Gryffindor against Slytherin, is it not? I hear you're a useful player. I was a Seeker, too. I was asked to try for the National Squad, but preferred to dedicate my life to the eradication of the Dark Forces. Still, if ever you feel the need for a little private training, don't hesitate to ask. Always happy to pass on my expertise to less able players. ...\" ",
    "Harry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then hurried off after Ron and Hermione. ",
    "\"I don't believe it,\" Harry said as the three of Ron and Hermione examined an enormous loopy signature on the note. \"Harry didn't even look at a book called Moste Potente Potions.\" ",
    "\"That's because Harry's a brainless git,\" said Ron. \"But who cares, we've got what we needed -- \" ",
    "\"He is not a brainless git,\" said Hermione shrilly as they half ran toward the library. ",
    "\"Just because He said you were the best student of the year -- \" ",
    "they dropped they voices as they entered the muffled stillness of the library. Madam Pince, the librarian, was a thin, irritable woman who looked like an underfed vulture. ",
    "\"Moste Potente Potions?\" she repeated suspiciously, trying to take the note from Hermione; but Hermione wouldn't let go. ",
    "\"I was wondering if I could keep it,\" she said breathlessly. ",
    "\"Oh, come on,\" said Ron, wrenching it from she grasp and thrusting it at Madam Pince. \"We'll get you another autograph. Professor Lockhart 'll sign anything if it stands still long enough.\" ",
    "Madam Pince held the note up to the light, as though determined to detect a forgery, but the light passed the test. Madam Pince stalked away between the lofty shelves and returned several minutes later carrying a large and moldy-looking book. Hermione put it carefully into Madam Pince and Hermione left, trying not to walk too quickly or look too guilty. ",
    "Five minutes later, Hermione were barricaded in Moaning Myrtle's out-of-order bathroom once again. Hermione had overridden Ron's objections by pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right minds would go, so their were guaranteed some privacy. Moaning Myrtle was crying noisily in Madam Pince stall, but their were ignoring Madam Pince, and Madam Pince their. ",
    "Hermione opened Moste Potente Potions carefully, and the three of their bent over the damp-spotted pages. ",
    "It was clear from a glance why It belonged in the Restricted Section of the library. Some of Moste Potente Potions had effects almost too gruesome to think about, and there were some very unpleasant illustrations, which included a  ",
    "man who seemed to have been turned inside out and a witch sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of Madam Pince head. ",
    "\"Here it is,\" said Hermione excitedly as Madam Pince found the page headed The Polyjuice Potion. the page was decorated with drawings of people halfway through transforming into other people. Harry sincerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on their faces. ",
    "\"This is the most complicated potion I've ever seen,\" said Hermione as they scanned the recipe. \"Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass,\" Hermione murmured, running Hermione finger down the list of ingredients. \"Well, they're easy enough, they're in the student store-cupboard, we can help we. ... Oooh, look, powdered horn of a bicorn -- don't know where we're going to get that -- shredded skin of a boomslang -- thatll be tricky, too -- and of course a bit of whoever we want to change into.\" ",
    "\"Excuse me?\" said Ron sharply. \"What d'you mean, a bit of whoever we're changing into? I'm drinking nothing with Crabbe's toenails in it -- Hermione continued as though Hermione hadn't heard Crabbe. ",
    "\"We don't have to worry about that yet, though, because We add those bits last. ...\" ",
    "Ron turned, speechless, to Harry, who had another worry. ",
    "\"D'you realize how much We're going to have to steal, Hermione? Shredded skin of a boomslang, that's definitely not in the students' cupboard. What're we going to do, break into Snape's private stores? I don't know if this is a good idea. ...\" ",
    "Hermione shut a book called Moste Potente Potions with a snap. ",
    "\"Well, if you two are going to chicken out, fine,\" Hermione said. There were bright pink patches on Hermione cheeks and Hermione eyes were brighter than usual. \" I don't want to break rules, you know.  think threatening Muggle- borns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion. But if you don't want to find out if it's Malfoy, I'll go straight to Madam Pince now and hand a book called Moste Potente Potions back in -- \" ",
    "\"I never thought I'd see the day when you'd be persuading us to break rules,\" said Ron. \"All right, us'll do it. But not toenails, okay?\" ",
    "\"How long will it take to make, anyway?\" said Harry as Hermione, looking happier, opened a book called Moste Potente Potions again. ",
    "\"Well, since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon and the lacewings have got to be stewed for twenty-one days ... I'd say it'd be ready in about a month, if we can get all the ingredients.\" ",
    "\"A month?\" said Ron. \"Malfoy could have attacked half the Muggle-borns in the school by then!\" But Hermione 's eyes narrowed dangerously again, and Malfoy added swiftly, \"But it's the best plan we've got, so full steam ahead, I say.\" ",
    "However, while Hermione was checking that the coast was clear for them to leave the bathroom, Ron muttered to Harry, \"It'll be a lot less hassle if you can just knock Malfoy off Malfoy broom tomorrow.\" ",
    "Harry woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a while thinking about the coming Quidditch match. Harry was nervous, mainly at the thought of what Wood would say if Gryffindor lost, but also at the idea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms  ",
    "gold could buy. Harry had never wanted to beat Slytherin so badly. After half an hour of lying there with Harry insides churning, Harry got up, dressed, and went down to breakfast early, where Harry found the rest of a team huddled at the long, empty table, all looking uptight and not speaking much. ",
    "As eleven o'clock approached, the whole school started to make the whole school way down to the Quidditch stadium. It was a muggy sort of day with a hint of thunder in the air. Ron and Hermione came hurrying over to wish Harry good luck as Harry entered the locker rooms. a team pulled on Ron and Hermione scarlet Gryffindor robes, then sat down to listen to Wood's usual pre- match pep talk. ",
    "\"Slytherin has better brooms than us,\" \"Slytherin began. \"No point denying it. But Ron and Hermione've got better people on Ron and Hermione brooms. Ron and Hermione've trained harder than they have, Ron and Hermione've been flying in all weathers -- \" (\"Too true,\" muttered George Weasley. \"I haven't been properly dry since August\") \" -- and Ron and Hermione're going to make Ron and Hermione rue the day Ron and Hermione let that little bit of slime, Malfoy, buy his way onto a team.\" ",
    "Chest heaving with emotion, Wood turned to Harry. ",
    "\"It'll be down to you, Harry, to show you, Harry that a Seeker has to have something more than a rich father. Get to that Snitch before Malfoy or die trying, Harry, because we've got to win today, we've got to.\" ",
    "\"So no pressure, Harry,\" said Fred, winking at Harry. ",
    "As they walked out onto the field, a roar of noise greeted they; mainly cheers, because Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were anxious to see Slytherin beaten, but the Slytherins in the crowd made they boos and hisses heard, too. Madam Hooch, the Quidditch  ",
    "teacher, asked Flint and Wood to shake hands, which Flint and Wood did, giving each other threatening stares and gripping rather harder than was necessary. ",
    "\"On my whistle,\" said Madam Hooch. \"Three ... two ... one ...\" ",
    "With a roar from the crowd to speed the crowd upward, the fourteen players rose toward the leaden sky. ",
    "Harry flew higher than any of the fourteen players, squinting around for that Snitch. ",
    "\"All right there, Scarhead?\" yelled Malfoy, shooting underneath Malfoy as though to show off the speed of Malfoy broom. ",
    "Harry had no time to reply. At that very moment, a heavy black Bludger came pelting toward a heavy black Bludger; a heavy black Bludger avoided a heavy black Bludger so narrowly that a heavy black Bludger felt a heavy black Bludger ruffle a heavy black Bludger hair as a heavy black Bludger passed. ",
    "\"Close one, Harry!\" said George, streaking past a heavy black Bludger with a heavy black Bludger club in a heavy black Bludger hand, ready to knock a heavy black Bludger back toward Slytherin. Harry saw George give a heavy black Bludger a powerful whack in the direction of Adrian Pucey, but a heavy black Bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight for Harry again. ",
    "Harry dropped quickly to avoid it, and George managed to hit it hard toward Malfoy. Once again, a heavy black Bludger swerved like a boomerang and shot at Harry's head. ",
    "Harry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of the field. Harry could hear a heavy black Bludger whistling along behind Harry. What was going on? the Bludgers never concentrated on one player like this; the Bludgers was the Bludgers job to try and unseat as many people as possible. ... ",
    "George Weasley was waiting for a heavy black Bludger at the other end. Harry ducked as Fred swung at a heavy black Bludger with all Harry might; a heavy black Bludger was knocked off course. ",
    "\"Gotcha!\" Fred yelled happily, but Fred was wrong; as though it was magnetically attracted to Harry, a heavy black Bludger pelted after Fred once more and Harry was forced to fly off at full speed. ",
    "a heavy black Bludger had started to rain; Harry felt heavy drops fall onto Harry face, splattering onto Harry glasses. Harry didn't have a clue what was going on in the rest of the game until Harry heard Lee Jordan, who was commentating, say, \"Slytherin lead, sixty points to zero -- \" ",
    "The Slytherins' superior brooms were clearly doing \" ",
    "The Slytherins' superior brooms jobs, and meanwhile a heavy black Bludger a heavy black Bludger was doing all a heavy black Bludger could to knock Harry out of the air.

    "\"Someone's -- tampered -- with -- this -- Bludger -- \" Fred grunted, swinging his bat with all his might at his bat as his bat launched a new attack on Harry. ",
    "\"We need time out,\" said George, trying to signal to Wood and stop a heavy black Bludger breaking Harry's nose at the same time. ",
    "Wood had obviously got the message. Madam Hooch's whistle rang out and Harry, Fred, and George dived for the ground, still trying to avoid a heavy black Bludger. ",
    "\"What's going on?\" said Wood as a team huddled together, while Slytherins in the crowd jeered. \"We're being flattened. Fred, George, where ",
    "were you when that a heavy black Bludger stopped Angelina scoring?\" ",
    "\"We were twenty feet above Angelina, stopping a heavy black Bludger a heavy black Bludger from murdering Harry, Oliver,\" said George angrily. \"Someone's fixed it -- it won't leave Harry alone. it hasn't gone for anyone else all game. Slytherins must have done something to Slytherins.\" ",
    "\"But the Bludgers have been locked in Madam Hooch's office since We last practice, and there was nothing wrong with them then. ...\" said Wood, anxiously. ",
    "Madam Hooch was walking toward them. Over Madam Hooch shoulder, Harry could see the \"Slytherin team jeering and pointing in Harry direction. ",
    "\"Listen,\" said Harry as Madam Hooch came nearer and nearer, \"with you two flying around me all the time the only way I'm going to catch that Snitch is if that Snitch flies up my sleeve. Go back to the rest of a team and let me deal with the rogue one.\" ",
    "\"Don't be thick,\" said Fred. \"It'll take your head off.\" ",
    "Wood was looking from Harry to the Weasleys. ",
    "\"Oliver, this is insane,\" said Alicia Spinnet angrily. \"You can't let Harry deal with that thing on Harry own. Let's ask for an inquiry -- \" ",
    "\"If 's stop now, 's'll have to forfeit the match!\" said Harry. \"And 's're not losing to \"Slytherin just because of a crazy Bludger! Come on, \"Oliver, tell them to leave me alone!\" ",
    "\"This is all your fault,George George said angrily to Wood. \" 'Get that Snitch or die trying,' what a stupid thing to tell him--\" ",
    "Madam Hooch had joined them. ",

    "\"All right,\" George said. \"Fred, George, you heard Harry -- leave Harry alone and let Harry deal with a heavy black Bludger on Harry own.\" ",
    "The rain was falling more heavily now. On Madam Hooch whistle, Harry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of a heavy black Bludger. Higher and higher Harry climbed; Harry looped and swooped, spiraled, zigzagged, and rolled. Slightly dizzy, Harry nevertheless kept Harry eyes wide open, rain was speckling Harry glasses and ran up Harry nostrils as Harry hung upside down, avoiding another fierce dive from a heavy black Bludger. Harry could hear laughter from the crowd; Harry knew Harry must look very stupid, but a heavy black Bludger a heavy black Bludger was heavy and couldn't change direction as quickly as Harry could; Harry began a kind of roller-coaster ride around the edges of the Quidditch stadium, squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the Gryffindor goal posts, where Adrian Pucey was trying to get past Wood -- ",
    "A whistling in Harry's ear told Harry a heavy black Bludger had just missed Harry again; Harry turned right over and sped in the opposite direction. ",
    "\"Training for the ballet, Potter?\" yelled Malfoy as Harry was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the Bludger, and Harry fled, a heavy black Bludger trailing a few feet behind Harry; and then, glaring back at Malfoy in hatred, Harry saw it -- the Golden Snitch. it -- the Golden Snitch was hovering inches above Malfoy's left ear -- and Malfoy, busy laughing at Harry, hadn't seen it -- the Golden Snitch.

    "Harry took Harry remaining hand off his rain- drenched broom and made a wild snatch; Harry felt Harry fingers close on that Snitch but was now only gripping the broom with his legs, and there was a yell from the crowd below as his headed straight for the ground, trying hard not to pass out. ",

    "his came around, rain falling on his face, still lying on the field, with someone leaning over his. his saw a glitter of teeth. ",
    "\"Oh, no, not you,\" his moaned. ",
    "\"Doesn't know what his's saying,\" said his loudly to the anxious crowd of Gryffindors pressing around them. \"Not to worry, Harry. I'm about to fix His arm.\" ",
    "\"iVo!\" said Harry. \"I'll keep it like this, thanks. ...\" ",
    "his tried to sit up, but the pain was terrible. his heard a familiar clicking noise nearby. ",
    "\"I don't want a photo of this, Colin,\" his said loudly. ",
    "\"Lie back, Harry,\" said his soothingly. \"It's a simple charm I've used countless times -- \" ",
    "\"Why can't I just go to the hospital wing?\" said Harry through clenched teeth. ",
    "\"his should really, his,\" said a muddy Wood, who couldn't help grinning even though his Seeker was injured. \"Great capture, Harry, really spectacular, your best yet, I'd say -- \" ",
    "Through the thicket of legs around Harry, Harry spotted Fred and George Weasley, wrestling the rogue ",
    "Bludger into a box. It was still putting up a terrific fight. ",
    "\"Stand back,\" said Lockhart, who was rolling up his jade-green sleeves. ",
    "\"No -- don't -- \" said Harry weakly, but his was twirling Harry wand and a second later had directed his wand straight at Harry's arm. ",
    "A strange and unpleasant sensation started at Harry's shoulder and spread all the way down to Harry fingertips. It felt as though Harry's arm was being deflated. Harry didn't dare look at what was happening. Harry had shut Harry eyes, Harry face turned away from Harry's arm, but Harry worst fears were realized as the people above Harry gasped and Colin Creevey began clicking away madly. Harry's arm didn't hurt anymore -- nor did Harry's arm feel remotely like an arm. ",
    "\"Ah,\" said his. \"Yes. Well, that can sometimes happen. But the point is, the bones are no longer broken. That's the thing to bear in mind. So, Harry, just toddle up to the hospital wing -- ah, Mr. ",
    "Weasley, Miss Granger, would you escort Harry? -- and Madam Pomfrey will be able to -- er -- tidy you up a bit.\" ",
    "As Harry got to Harry feet, Harry felt strangely lopsided. Taking a deep breath Harry looked down at Harry right side. What Harry saw nearly made Harry pass out again. ",
    "Poking out of the end of Harry robes was what looked like a thick, flesh-colored rubber glove. Harry tried to move Harry fingers. Nothing happened. ",
    "his hadn't mended Harry's bones. his had removed Harry's bones. ",
    "Madam Pomfrey wasn't at all pleased. ",
    "\"You should have come straight to me!\" Madam Pomfrey raged, holding up the sad, limp remainder of what, half an hour before, had been a working arm. \"I can mend bones in a second -- but growing bones back -- \" ",
    "\"You will be able to, won't you?\" said Harry desperately. ",
    "\"I'll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful,\" said Madam Pomfrey grimly, throwing Harry a pair of pajamas. \"You'll have to stay the night. ...\" ",
    "Hermione waited outside the curtain drawn around Harry's bed while Ron helped Ron into Ron pajamas. It took a while to stuff the rubbery, boneless arm into a sleeve. ",
    "\"How can you stick up for his now, Hermione, eh?\" Ron called through the curtain drawn around Harry's bed as Ron pulled Harry's limp fingers through the cuff. \"If Harry had wanted deboning Harry would have asked.\" ",
    "\"Anyone can make a mistake,\" said Hermione. \"And it doesn't hurt anymore, does it, Harry?\" ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry, getting into bed. \"But it doesn't do anything else either.\" ",
    "As he swung he onto Harry's bed, he arm flapped pointlessly. ",
    "Hermione and Madam Pomfrey came around the curtain drawn around Harry's bed. Madam Pomfrey was holding a large bottle of something labeled Skele-Gro. ",
    "\"You're in for a rough night,\" Madam Pomfrey said, pouring out a steaming beakerful and handing a large bottle of something labeled Skele-Gro to Madam Pomfrey. \"Regrowing bones is a nasty business.\" ",
    "So was taking Skele-Gro. Skele-Gro burned Harry's mouth and throat as Skele-Gro went down, making Harry cough and splutter. Still tut-tutting about dangerous sports and inept teachers, Madam Pomfrey retreated, leaving Ron and Hermione to help Harry gulp down some water. ",
    "\"We won, though,\" said Ron and Hermione. \"That was some catch you made. Malfoy's face ... Malfoy's face looked ready to kill. ...\" ",
    "\"I want to know how Malfoy's face fixed that Bludger,\" said Hermione darkly. ",
    "\"We can add that to the list of questions We'll ask Malfoy's face when We've taken the Polyjuice Potion,\" said Harry, sinking back onto Malfoy's face pillows. \"I hope it tastes better than this stuff. ...\" ",
    "\"If it's got bits of Slytherins in it? You've got to be joking,\" said Ron. ",
    "The door of the hospital wing burst open at that moment. Filthy and soaking wet, the rest of the Gryffindor team had arrived to see Harry. ",
    "\"Unbelievable flying, Harry,\" said George. \"I've just seen Marcus Flint yelling at Malfoy. Something about having the Snitch on top of Marcus Flint head and not noticing. Malfoy didn't seem too happy.\" ",
    "They had brought cakes, sweets, and bottles of pumpkin juice; They gathered around Harry's bed and were just getting started on what promised to be a good party when Madam Pomfrey came storming over, ",
    "shouting, \"This boy needs rest, Madam Pomfrey's got thirty- three bones to regrow! Out! OUT!\" ",
    "And Harry was left alone, with nothing to distract Harry from the stabbing pains in Harry limp arm. ",
    "Hours and hours later, Harry woke quite suddenly in the pitch blackness and gave a small yelp of pain: his limp arm now felt full of large splinters. For a second, Harry thought that was what had woken Harry. Then, with a thrill of horror, Harry realized that someone was sponging Harry forehead in the dark. ",
    "\"Get off!\" Harry said loudly, and then, \"Dobby\\\" ",
    "The house-elf's goggling tennis ball eyes were peering at Harry through the darkness. A single tear was running down Harry long, pointed nose. ",
    "\"Harry Potter came back to school,\" Harry whispered miserably. \"Dobby warned and warned \"Harry Potter. Ah sir, why didn't you heed Dobby? Why didn't \"Harry Potter go back home when \"Harry Potter missed the train?\" ",
    "Harry heaved \" ",
    "Harry up on \" ",
    "Harry pillows and pushed Dobby's sponge away. ",
    "\"What're you doing here?\" \" ",
    "Harry said. \"And how did you know I missed the train?\" ",
    "Dobby's lip trembled and Harry was seized by a sudden suspicion. ",
    "\"It was you!\" \" ",
    "Harry said slowly. \"You stopped the barrier from letting us through!\" ",
    "\"Indeed yes, sir,\" said Dobby, nodding sir head vigorously, ears flapping. \"Dobby hid and watched for \"Harry Potter and sealed the gateway and Dobby had ",
    "to iron Dobby hands afterward\" -- Dobby showed Harry ten long, bandaged fingers -- \"but Dobby didn't care, sir, for Dobby thought \"Harry Potter was safe, and never did Dobby dream that \"Harry Potter would get to school another way!\" ",
    "Dobby was rocking backward and forward, shaking his head. ",
    "Dobby Dobby was so shocked when Dobby heard \"Harry Potter was back at Hogwarts, Dobby let Dobby master's dinner burn! Such a flogging Dobby never had, sir. ...\" ",
    "Harry slumped back onto Harry pillows. ",
    "\"You nearly got Ron and me expelled,\" Harry said fiercely. \"You'd better get lost before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you.Dobby smiled weakly. ",
    "Dobby Dobby is used to death threats, sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home.\" ",
    "Dobby blew Dobby nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase Dobby wore, looking so pathetic that Harry felt Harry anger ebb away in spite of Harry. ",
    "\"Why d'you wear that thing, Dobby?\" Harry asked curiously. ",
    "\"This, sir?\" said Dobby, plucking at the pillowcase. \" Tis a mark of the house-elf's enslavement, sir. Dobby can only be freed if Dobby masters present Dobby with clothes, sir. The family is careful not to pass Dobby even a sock, sir, for then sir would be free to leave The family house forever.\" ",
    "Dobby mopped Dobby bulging eyes and said suddenly, \"Harry Potter \"Harry Potter must go home! Dobby thought Dobby Bludger would be enough to make -- \" ",
    "\"Your Bludger?\" said Harry, anger rising once more. \"What d'you mean, your Bludger? You made that Bludger try and kill me?\" ",
    "\"Not kill you, sir, never kill you!\" said Dobby, shocked. \"Dobby wants to save \"Harry Potter life! Better sent home, grievously injured, than remain here, sir! Dobby only wanted \"Harry Potter hurt enough to be sent home!\" ",
    "\"Oh, is that all?\" said Harry angrily. \"I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you wanted me sent home in pieces?\" ",
    "\"Ah, if \"Harry Potter only knew!\" Dobby groaned, more tears dripping onto Dobby ragged pillowcase. \"If Dobby knew what Dobby means to us, to the lowly, the enslaved, us dregs of the magical world! Dobby remembers how it was when He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was at the height of Dobby powers, sir! We house-elves were treated like vermin, sir! Of course, Dobby is still treated like that, sir,\" Dobby admitted, drying Dobby face on the pillowcase. \"But mostly, sir, life has improved for my kind since you triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be- Named. \"Harry Potter survived, and the Dark Lord's power was broken, and it was a new dawn, sir, and \"Harry Potter shone like a beacon of hope for those of us who thought the Dark days would never end, sir.

    "... And now, at Hogwarts, terrible things are to happen, are perhaps happening already, and Dobby cannot let \"Harry Potter stay here now that history is to repeat Dobby, now that the Chamber of Secrets is open once more -- Dobby froze, horrors truck, then grabbed Harry's water jug from Harry bedside table and cracked Harry's water jug over Harry own head, toppling out of sight. A second later, Harry crawled back onto the bed, cross-eyed, muttering, \"Bad Dobby, very bad Dobby ...\" ",
    "\"So there is a Chamber of Secrets?\" Harry whispered. \"And -- did you say it's been opened before ? Tell me, Dobby!\" ",
    "Harry seized the elf's bony wrist as Dobby's hand inched toward the water jug. \"But I'm not Muggle-born -- how can I be in danger from a Chamber of Secrets?\" ",
    "\"Ah, sir, ask no more, ask no more of Dobby,\" stammered the elf, sir eyes huge in the dark. \"Dark deeds are planned in this place, but \"Harry Potter must not be here when Dark deeds happen -- go home, ",
    "\"Harry Potter, go home. \"Harry Potter must not meddle in this, sir, 'tis too dangerous -- \" ",
    "\"Who is it, Dobby?\" Harry said, keeping a firm hold on Dobby's wrist to stop Harry from hitting Harry with the water jug again. \"Who's opened it? Who opened it last time?\" ",
    "Dobby can't, sir, Dobby can't, Dobby mustn't tell!\" squealed the elf. \"Go home, \"Harry Potter, go home!\" ",
    "\"I'm not going anywhere!\" said Harry fiercely. \"One of my best friends is Muggle-born; she'll be first in line if a Chamber of Secrets really has been opened -- \" ",
    "\"Harry Potter \"Harry Potter risks \"Harry Potter own life for my best friends!\" moaned Dobby in a kind of miserable ecstasy. \"So noble! So valiant! But \"Harry Potter must save \"Harry Potter, \"Harry Potter must, \"Harry Potter must not -- Dobby Dobby suddenly froze, \"Harry Potter bat ears quivering. Harry heard it, too. There were footsteps coming down the passageway outside. ",
    "Dobby must go!\" breathed the elf, terrified. There was a loud crack, and Harry's fist was suddenly clenched on thin air. Harry slumped back into bed, Harry eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the footsteps drew nearer. ",
    "Next moment, Dumbledore was backing into the dormitory, wearing a long woolly dressing gown and a nightcap. Dumbledore was carrying one end of what looked like a statue. Professor McGonagall appeared a second later, carrying Professor McGonagall feet. Together, they heaved Professor McGonagall onto a bed. ",
    "\"Get Madam Pomfrey,\" whispered Dumbledore, and Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall hurried past the end of Harry's bed out of sight. Harry lay quite still, pretending to be asleep. Harry heard urgent voices, and then Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall swept back into view, closely followed by Madam Pomfrey, who was pulling a cardigan on over Professor McGonagall nightdress. Harry heard a sharp intake of breath. ",
    "\"What happened?\" Madam Pomfrey whispered to Dumbledore, bending over the statue on the bed. ",
    "\"Another attack,\" said Dumbledore. \"Minerva found Dumbledore on the stairs.\" ",
    "\"There was a bunch of grapes next to Dumbledore,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"We think Dumbledore was trying to sneak up here to visit \"Harry Potter.\" ",
    "Harry's stomach gave a horrible lurch. Slowly and carefully, Dumbledore raised Dumbledore a few inches so Dumbledore could look at the statue on the bedthe bed. A ray of moonlight lay across A ray of moonlight staring face. ",
    "It was Colin Creevey. Dumbledore eyes were wide and Dumbledore were stuck up in front of Dumbledore, holding Dumbledore camera. ",
    "\"Petrified?\" whispered Madam Pomfrey. ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"But I shudder to think ... If Albus hadn't been on the way downstairs for hot chocolate -- who knows what might have -- \" ",
    "The three of Albus hadn't been on the way downstairs for hot chocolate -- stared down at Colin. Then Dumbledore leaned forward and wrenched his camera out of Colin's rigid grip. ",
    "\"You don't think Dumbledore managed to get a picture of Dumbledore attacker?\" said Professor McGonagall eagerly. ",
    "Dumbledore didn't answer. Dumbledore opened the back of his camera. ",
    "\"Good gracious!\" said Madam Pomfrey. ",
    "A jet of steam had hissed out of his camera. Harry, three beds away, caught the acrid smell of burnt plastic. ",
    "\"Melted,\" said Madam Pomfrey wonderingly. \"All melted ...\" ",
    "\"What does this mean, Albus?\" Professor McGonagall asked urgently. ",
    "\"It means,\" said Dumbledore, \"that the Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again.\" ",
    "Madam Pomfrey clapped a hand to Madam Pomfrey mouth. Professor McGonagall stared at Dumbledore. ",
    "\"But, Albus ... surely ... who?\" ",
    "\"The question is not who,\" said Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall eyes on Colin. \"The question is, how. ...\" ",
    "And from what Harry could see of Professor McGonagall's shadowy face, Madam Pomfrey didn't understand this any better than Professor McGonagall did. "

  "THE DUELING CLUB": [
    "Harry woke up on Sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing with winter sunlight and Harry arm reboned but very stiff. Harry sat up quickly and looked over at Colin's bed, but THE DUELING CLUB ",
    "Harry had been blocked from view by the high curtains Harry had changed behind yesterday. Seeing that Harry was awake, Madam Pomfrey came bustling over with a breakfast tray and then began bending and stretching Harry arm and fingers. ",
    "\"All in order,\" Madam Pomfrey said as Harry clumsily fed Harry porridge left-handed. \"When you've finished eating, you may leave.\" ",
    "Harry dressed as quickly as Harry could and hurried off to Gryffindor Tower, desperate to tell Ron and Hermione about Colin and Dobby, but Ron and Hermione weren't there. Harry left to look for Ron and Hermione, wondering where Ron and Hermione could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that Ron and Hermione weren't interested in whether Harry had Harry bones back or not. ",
    "As Harry passed the library, Percy Weasley strolled out of the library, looking in far better spirits than last time Ron and Hermione'd met. ",
    "\"Oh, hello, Harry,\" Harry said. \"Excellent flying yesterday, really excellent. Gryffindor has just taken the lead for the House Cup -- you earned fifty points!\" ",
    "\"You haven't seen Ron and Hermione, have you?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"No, I haven't,\" said Percy, Percy smile fading. \"I hope Ron's not in another girls' toilet ...\" ",
    "Harry forced a laugh, watched Percy walk out of sight, and then headed straight for Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. Percy couldn't see why Ron and Hermione would be in there again, but after making sure that neither Filch nor any prefects were around, Percy opened the door and heard Ron and Hermione voices coming from a locked stall. ",
    "\"It's me,\" Percy said, closing the door behind Percy. There was a clunk, a splash, and a gasp from within a locked stall and Percy saw Hermione 's eye peering through the keyhole. ",
    "\"Harry\\\" she said. \"You gave us such a fright -- come in -- how's your arm?\" ",
    "\"Fine,\" said Harry, squeezing into a locked stall. An old cauldron was perched on the toilet, and a crackling from under the rim told Harry Ron and Hermione had lit a fire beneath a fire. Conjuring up portable, waterproof fires was a speciality of Hermione 's. ",
    "\"We 'd've come to meet you, but We decided to get started on the Polyjuice Potion,\" Ron explained as HarryHarry, with difficulty, locked a locked stall again. \"We've decided this is the safest place to hide this.\" ",
    "Harry started to tell them about Colin, but Hermione interrupted. ",
    "\"We already know -- We heard Professor McGonagall telling Professor Flitwick this morning. That's why We decided We'd better get going -- \" ",
    "\"The sooner We get a confession out of Malfoy, the better,\" snarled Ron. \"D'you know what I think? D'you was in such a foul temper after the Quidditch match, D'you took it out on Colin.\" ",
    "\"There's something else,\" said Harry, watching Hermione tearing bundles of knotgrass and throwing bundles of knotgrass into the Polyjuice Potion. \"Dobby came to visit me in the middle of the night.\" ",
    "Ron and Hermione looked up, amazed. Harry told \" ",
    "Ron and Hermione everything Dobby had told Harry -- or hadn't told Harry. \" ",
    "Ron and Hermione listened with \" ",
    "Ron and Hermione mouths open. ",
    "\"the Chamber of Secrets Secrets has been opened before?\" Hermione said. ",
    "\"This settles it,\" said Ron in a triumphant voice. \"Malfoy must've opened a Chamber of Secrets when Malfoy was at school here and now Malfoy's told dear old Draco how to do it. It's obvious. Wish Dobby 'd told you what kind of monster's in there, though. I want to know how come nobody's noticed it sneaking around school.\" ",
    "\"Maybe it can make it invisible,\" said Hermione, prodding leeches to the bottom of the cauldron. \"Or maybe it can disguise it -- pretend to be a suit of ",
    "armor or something -- I've read about Chameleon Ghouls -- \" ",
    "\"You read too much, Hermione,\" said Ron, pouring dead lacewings on top of the leeches. Ron crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and looked at Harry. ",
    "\"So Dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke your arm. ...\" Ron shook Ron head. \"You know what, Harry? If Harry doesn't stop trying to save your life Harry's going to kill you.\" ",
    "k k k ",
    "The news that Colin Creevey had been attacked and was now lying as though dead in the hospital wing had spread through school by Monday morning. The air was suddenly thick with rumor and suspicion. The first years were now moving around the castle in tight-knit groups, as though scared they would be attacked if they ventured forth alone. ",
    "Ginny Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in Charms, was distraught, but Harry felt that Fred and George were going the wrong way about cheering her up. Fred and George were taking turns covering Fred and George with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind statues. Fred and George only stopped when Percy, apoplectic with rage, told Fred and George Percy was going to write to Percy Weasley and tell Percy Weasley Ginny was having nightmares. ",
    "Meanwhile, hidden from the teachers, a roaring trade in talismans, amulets, and other protective devices was sweeping school. Neville Longbottom bought a large, evil-smelling green onion, a pointed purple crystal, and a rotting newt tail before the other Gryffindor boys pointed out that Neville Longbottom was in no danger; ",
    "Neville Longbottom was a pureblood, and therefore unlikely to be attacked. ",
    "\"They went for Filch first,\" Neville Longbottom said, \" Neville round face fearful. \"And everyone knows I'm almost a Squib.\" ",
    "In the second week of December Professor McGonagall came around as usual, collecting names of those who would be staying at school for Christmas. Harry, Ron, and Hermione signed her list; Harry, Ron, and Hermione had heard that Malfoy was staying, which struck Harry, Ron, and Hermione as very suspicious. The holidays would be the perfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and try to worm a confession out of the Polyjuice Potion. ",
    "Unfortunately, the Polyjuice Potion was only half finished. Harry, Ron, and Hermione still needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin, and the only place Harry, Ron, and Hermione were going to get Harry, Ron, and Hermione was from Snape's private stores. Harry privately felt Harry'd rather face Slytherin's legendary monster than let Snape catch Harry robbing Harry office. ",
    "\"What we need,\" said Hermione briskly as Thursday afternoon's double Potions lesson loomed nearer, \"is a diversion. Then one of us can sneak into Snape's office and take what us need.\" ",
    "\" ",
    "Ron and Hermione looked at her nervously. ",
    "\"I think I'd better do the actual stealing,\" Hermione continued in a matter-of-fact tone. \"You two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble, and I've got a clean record. So all you need to do is cause enough mayhem to keep Snape busy for five minutes or so.\" ",
    "Harry smiled feebly. Deliberately causing mayhem in Snape's Potions class was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye. ",
    "Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. Thursday afternoon's lesson proceeded in the usual way. Twenty cauldrons stood steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brass scales and jars of ingredients. Snape prowled through the fumes, making waspish remarks about the Gryffindors' work while the Slytherins sniggered appreciatively. Draco Malfoy, who was Snape's favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at Ron and Harry, who knew that if Draco Malfoy, who was Snape's favorite student retaliated Draco Malfoy, who was Snape's favorite student would get detention faster than you could say \"Unfair.\" ",
    "Harry's Swelling Solution was far too runny, but Harry had Harry mind on more important things. Harry was waiting for Hermione's signal, and Harry hardly listened as Snape paused to sneer at Snape watery potion. When Snape turned and walked off to bully Neville, Hermione caught Harry's eye and nodded. ",
    "Harry ducked swiftly down behind Harry cauldron, pulled one of Fred's Filibuster fireworks out of Harry pocket, and gave his pocket a quick prod with Harry wand. The firework began to fizz and sputter. Knowing Harry had only seconds, Harry straightened up, took aim, and lobbed only seconds into the air; only seconds landed right on target in Goyle's cauldron. ",
    "Goyle's potion exploded, showering Snape's Potions class. People shrieked as splashes of the Swelling Solution hit People. Malfoy got a faceful and Malfoy nose began to swell like a balloon; Goyle blundered around, Malfoy hands over Malfoy eyes, which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate -- Snape was trying to restore calm and find out what had happened. Through the confusion, Harry saw Hermione slip quietly into Snape's office. ",
    "\"Silence! SILENCE!\" Snape roared. \"Anyone who has been splashed, come here for a Deflating Draught -- when I find out who did this -- \" ",
    "Harry tried not to laugh as Harry watched Malfoy hurry forward, his head drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon. As half the class lumbered up to Snape 's desk, some weighted down with arms like clubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffed- up lips, Harry saw Hermione slide back into the dungeon, the front of Harry robes bulging. ",
    "When everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings had subsided, Snape swept over to Goyle's cauldron and scooped out the twisted black remains of The firework. There was a sudden hush. ",
    "\"If I ever find out who threw this,\" Snape whispered, \"I shall make sure that person is expelled.\" ",
    "Harry arranged Harry face into what Harry hoped was a puzzled expression. Snape was looking right at Snape, and the bell that rang ten minutes later could not have been more welcome. ",
    "\"Snape knew it was me,Harry Harry told \" ",
    "Ron and Hermione as \" ",
    "Ron and Hermione hurried back to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. \"I could tell.\" ",
    "Hermione threw the new ingredients into Goyle's cauldron and began to stir feverishly. ",
    "\"It'll be ready in two weeks,\" Hermione said happily. ",
    "Snape can't prove it was you,\" said Ron reassuringly to Harry. \"What can Ron do?\" ",
    "\"Knowing Snape, something foul,\" said Harry as the potion frothed and bubbled. ",
    "A week later, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were walking across the entrance hall when Harry, Ron, and Hermione saw a small knot of people gathered around the notice board, reading a piece of parchment that had just been pinned up. Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas beckoned Harry, Ron, and Hermione over, looking excited. ",
    "\"Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas're starting a Dueling Club!\" said Seamus. \"First meeting tonight! I wouldn't mind dueling lessons; Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas might come in handy one of these days. ...\" ",
    "\"What, you reckon Slytherin's monster can duel?\" said Ron, but Ron, too, read the sign with interest. ",
    "\"Could be useful,\" Ron said to Harry, Ron, and Hermione as Harry, Ron, and Hermione went into dinner. \"Shall Harry, Ron, and Hermione go?\" ",
    "Harry, Ron, and Hermione were all for it, so at eight o'clock that evening Harry, Ron, and Hermione hurried back to the Great Hall. The long dining tables had vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall, lit by thousands of candles floating overhead. The ceiling was velvety black once more and most of school seemed to be packed beneath The ceiling, all carrying all wands and looking excited. ",
    "\"I wonder who'll be teaching us?\" said Hermione as they edged into the chattering crowd. \"Someone told me Flitwick was a dueling champion when Flitwick was young -- maybe it'll be Flitwick.\" ",
    "\"As long as it's not -- \" Harry began, but Harry ended on a groan: Gilderoy Lockhart was walking onto a golden stage, resplendent in robes of deep plum and accompanied by none other than Snape, wearing Gilderoy Lockhart usual black. ",
    "Gilderoy Lockhart waved an arm for silence and called, ",
    "\"Gather round, gather round! Can everyone see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent! ",
    "\"Now, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little dueling club, to train you all in case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions -- for full details, see my published works. ",
    "\"Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape,\" said Gilderoy Lockhart, flashing a wide smile. \"Gilderoy Lockhart tells me Gilderoy Lockhart knows a tiny little bit about dueling Gilderoy Lockhart and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration before we begin. Now, I don't want any of you youngsters to worry -- you'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with Gilderoy Lockhart, never fear!\" ",
    "\"Wouldn't it be good if they finished each other off?\" Ron muttered in Harry's ear. ",
    "Snape 's upper lip was curling. Harry wondered why Gilderoy Lockhart was still smiling; if Snape had been looking at Gilderoy Lockhart like that Gilderoy Lockhart'd have been running as fast as Gilderoy Lockhart could in the opposite direction. ",
    "my assistant, Professor Snape turned to face each other and bowed; at least, Gilderoy Lockhart did, with much twirling of Gilderoy Lockhart hands, whereas Snape jerked Snape head irritably. Then my assistant, Professor Snape raised my assistant, Professor Snape wands like swords in front of my assistant, Professor Snape. ",
    "\"As you see, we are holding we wands in the accepted combative position,\" Gilderoy Lockhart told the silent crowd. \"On the count of three, we will cast we first spells. Neither of we will be aiming to kill, of course.\" ",
    "\"I wouldn't bet on that,Harry Harry murmured, watching Snape baring Snape teeth. ",
    "\"One -- two -- three -- \" ",
    "Both of the silent crowd swung \" ",
    "Both of them above \" ",
    "Both of them heads and pointed \" ",
    "Both of them at \" ",
    "Both of them opponent; Snape cried: ",
    "\" ExpelliarmusV' There was a dazzling flash of scarlet light and Gilderoy Lockhart was blasted off Gilderoy Lockhart feet: Gilderoy Lockhart flew backward off the stage, smashed into the wall, and slid down the wall to sprawl on the floor. ",
    "Malfoy and some of the other Slytherins cheered. Hermione was dancing on tiptoes. \"Do you think Gilderoy Lockhart's all right?\" Hermione squealed through Hermione fingers. ",
    "\"Who cares?\" said Harry and Ron together. ",
    "Gilderoy Lockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet. Gilderoy Lockhart hat had fallen off and Gilderoy Lockhart wavy hair was standing on end. ",
    "\"Well, there you have it!\" Gilderoy Lockhart said, tottering back onto the platform. \"That was a Disarming Charm -- as you see, I've lost my wand -- ah, thank you, Miss Brown -- yes, an excellent idea to show you see that, Snape, but if you don't mind my saying so, it was very obvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy -- however, ",
    "I felt it would be instructive to let you see see ...\" ",
    "Snape was looking murderous. Possibly Gilderoy Lockhart had noticed, because Gilderoy Lockhart said, \"Enough demonstrating! I'm going to come amongst you now and put you all into pairs. Snape, if you'd like to help me -- \" ",

Harry felt the fear drain out of Harry. Harry knew the angry snake wouldn't attack anyone now, though how Harry knew the angry snake, Harry couldn't have explained. ",

    "\"Exactly,\" said Ron. \"And now the whole school's going to think you're his great-great-great-great- grandson or something -- \" ",

    "Quietly, Harry tried to say something in Parseltongue. The words wouldn't come. It seemed Harry had to be face-to-face with a snake to do it. ",
    "But I'm in Gryffindor, Harry thought. The Sorting Hat wouldn't have put me in here if I had Salazar Slytherin blood. ",
    "Ah, said a nasty little voice in Harry brain, but The Sorting Hat wanted to put you in Salazar Slytherin, don't you remember? ",
    "Harry turned over. Harry'd see Justin the next day in Herbology and Harry'd explain that Harry'd been calling the ",

    "By next morning, however, the snow that had begun in the night had turned into a blizzard so thick that the last Herbology lesson of the term was canceled: Professor Sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves on the Mandrakes, a tricky operation Professor Sprout would entrust to no one else, now that it was so important for the Mandrakes to grow quickly and revive Mrs. Norris and Colin Creevey.

    "Harry fretted about this next to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, while Ron nor Hermione used Ron nor Hermione time off to play a game of wizard chess. ",
    "\"For heaven's sake, Harry,\" said Hermione, exasperated, as one of Ron's bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged his off the board. ",
    "\"Go and find Justin if it's so important to you.\" ",
    "So Harry got up and left through the portrait hole, wondering where Justin might be. ",

Harry was walking toward A group of the Hufflepuffs who should have been in Herbology when something of what A group of the Hufflepuffs who should have been in Herbology were saying met Harry ears, and Harry paused to listen, hidden in the Invisibility section.

    "\"So anyway,\" a stout boy was saying, \"I told Justin to hide up in our dormitory.

For several long minutes, there was a scene of such confusion that Justin was in danger of being squashed and people kept standing in Nearly Headless Nick. Harry found Harry pinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet. Professor McGonagall came running, followed by Professor McGonagall own class, one of whom still had black-and-white- striped hair. Professor McGonagall used Professor McGonagall wand to set off a loud bang, which restored silence, and ordered everyone back into everyone classes. No sooner had a scene of such confusion that Justin was in danger of being squashed and people kept standing in Nearly Headless Nick cleared somewhat than Ernie the Hufflepuff arrived, panting, on a scene of such confusion that Justin was in danger of being squashed and people kept standing in Nearly Headless Nick.

In the end, Professor McGonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air, which Professor McGonagall gave to Ernie with instructions to waft Nearly Headless Nick up the stairs. Ernie Ernie did, fanning Nearly Headless Nick along like a silent black hovercraft. This left Harry and Professor McGonagall alone together. ",

    "\"Lemon drop!\" Professor McGonagall said. This was evidently a password, because a large and extremely ugly stone gargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind him split in two. Even full of dread for what was coming, Harry couldn't fail to be amazed. Behind the wall was a spiral staircase that was moving smoothly upward, like an escalator. As Harry and Professor McGonagall stepped onto it, Harry heard the wall thud closed behind he and Professor McGonagall. he and Professor McGonagall rose upward in circles, higher and higher, until at last, slightly dizzy, Harry saw a gleaming oak door ahead, with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin.

    "Harry looked around. One thing was certain: of all the teachers' offices Harry had visited so far this year, Dumbledore's was by far the most interesting. If Dumbledore hadn't been scared out of Dumbledore wits that Dumbledore was about to be thrown out of school, Dumbledore would have been very pleased to have a chance to look around it. ",
    "It was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little noises. A number of curious silver instruments stood on spindle-legged tables, whirring and emitting little puffs of smoke. The walls were covered with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, all of whom were snoozing gently in all of whom frames. There was also an enormous, claw- footed desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind an enormous, claw- footed desk, a shabby, tattered wizard's hat -- the Sorting Hat ",
    "Harry hesitated. Harry cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches and wizards on The walls. Surely it couldn't hurt if Harry took a shabby, tattered wizard's hat down and tried a shabby, tattered wizard's hat on again? Just to see ... just to make sure a shabby, tattered wizard's hat had put Harry in the right House -- ",
    "Harry walked quietly around an enormous, claw- footed desk, lifted a shabby, tattered wizard's hat from a shabby, tattered wizard's hat shelf, and lowered a shabby, tattered wizard's hat slowly onto His head. It was much too large and slipped down over his eyes, just as a shabby, tattered wizard's hat had done the last time Harry'd put a shabby, tattered wizard's hat on. Harry stared at the black inside of a shabby, tattered wizard's hat, waiting. Then a small voice said in Harry ear, \"Bee in your bonnet, Harry Potter?\" ",
    "\"Er, yes,\" Harry muttered. \"Er -- sorry to bother you -- I wanted to ask -- \" ",
    "\"You've been wondering whether I put you in the right House,\" said a shabby, tattered wizard's hat smartly. \"Yes ... you were particularly difficult to place. But I stand by what I said before\" -- Harry's heart leapt -- \"you would have done well in Slytherin -- \" ",
    "Harry's stomach plummeted. Harry grabbed the point of a shabby, tattered wizard's hat and pulled the point of the hat off. the point of the hat hung limply in Harry hand, grubby and faded. Harry pushed the point of the hat back onto the point of the hat , feeling sick. ",

    "\"It's a shame you had to see Dumbledore on a Burning Day,\" said Dumbledore, seating Dumbledore behind an enormous, claw- footed desk. \"Dumbledore's really very handsome most of the time, wonderful red and gold plumage. Fascinating ",
    "creatures, phoenixes. Fascinating ",
    "creatures, phoenixes can carry immensely heavy loads, Fascinating ",
    "creatures, phoenixes tears have healing powers, and Fascinating ",
    "creatures, phoenixes make highly faithful pets.\" ",
    "In the shock of \"Fawkes catching fire, Harry had forgotten what Harry was there for, but it all came back to Harry as Dumbledore settled Dumbledore in the high chair behind an enormous, claw- footed desk and fixed Harry with Harry penetrating, light-blue stare. ",
    "Before Dumbledore could speak another word, however, the door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and Hagrid burst in, a wild look in Dumbledore , Dumbledore balaclava perched on top of its head and the dead rooster still swinging from Dumbledore hand. ",
    "\"It wasn' Harry, Professor Dumbledore!\" said Hagrid urgently. \"I was talkin' ter Dumbledore seconds before that kid was found, Dumbledore never had time, sir -- \" ",
    "Dumbledore tried to say something, but Hagrid went ranting on, waving the rooster around in Dumbledore agitation, sending feathers everywhere. ",
    "\" -- it can't've bin Dumbledore, I'll swear it in front o' the Ministry o' Magic if I have to -- \" ",
    "\"Hagrid, I -- \" ",
    "\" -- yeh've got the wrong boy, sir, I know Harry never ",
    "\"Hagridl\" said Dumbledore loudly. \"I do not think that Harry attacked those people.\" ",
    "\"Oh,\" said Hagrid, the rooster falling limply at Harry side. \"Right. I'll wait outside then, Headmaster.\" ",
    "And Headmaster stomped out looking embarrassed. ",
    "\"You don't think it was me, Professor McGonagall?\" Harry repeated hopefully as Dumbledore brushed rooster feathers off an enormous, claw- footed desk. ",
    "\"No, Harry, I don't,\" said Dumbledore, though Dumbledore face was somber again. \"But I still want to talk to Harry.\" ",
    "Harry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered Dumbledore, the tips of Harry long fingers together. ",
    "\"I must ask you, Harry, whether there is anything you'd like to tell me,\" Harry said gently. \"Anything at all.\" ",
    "Harry didn't know what to say. Harry thought of Malfoy shouting, \"You'll be next, Mudbloods!\" and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. Then Harry thought of the disembodied voice Harry had heard twice and remembered what Ron had said: \" Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world.\" Harry thought, too, about what everyone was saying about Harry, and Harry growing dread that Harry was somehow connected with Salazar Slytherin. ... ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry. \"There isn't anything, Professor. ...\" ",
    "The double attack on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick turned what had hitherto been nervousness into real panic. Curiously, it was Nearly Headless Nick's fate that seemed to worry people most. What could possibly do that to a ghost? people asked each other; what terrible power could harm someone who was already dead? There was almost a stampede to book seats on the Hogwarts Express so that students could go home for Christmas. ",
    "\"At this rate, well be the only ones left,Ron Ron told Harry and Hermione. \"Us, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. What a jolly holiday it's going to be.\" ",
    "Crabbe and Goyle, who always did whatever Malfoy did, had signed up to stay over the holidays, too. But Harry was glad that most people were leaving. Harry was tired of people skirting around Harry in the corridors, as though Harry were about to sprout fangs or spit poison; tired of all the muttering, pointing, and hissing as Harry passed. ",
    "Fred and George, however, found all this very funny. Fred and George went out of Fred and George way to march ahead of Harry down the corridors, shouting, \"Make way for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming through. ...\" ",
    "Percy was deeply disapproving of this behavior. ",
    "\"It is not a laughing matter,\" \" ",
    "Percy said coldly. ",
    "\"Oh, get out of the way, \" ",
    "Percy,\" said Fred. \"Harry's in a hurry.\" ",
    "\"Yeah, Harry's off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with Harry fanged servant,\" said George, chortling. ",
    "Ginny didn't find it amusing either. ",
    "\"Oh, don't,\" Ginny wailed every time Fred asked Harry loudly who Harry was planning to attack next, or when George pretended to ward Harry off with a large clove of garlic when they met. ",
    "Harry didn't mind; it made Harry feel better that Fred and George, at least, thought the idea of Harry being Slytherin 's heir was quite ludicrous. But their antics seemed to be aggravating Draco Malfoy, who looked increasingly sour each time Harry saw their at it. ",
    "\"It's because Harry's bursting to say it's really Harry,\" said Ron knowingly. \"You know how Ron hates anyone beating Ron at anything, and you're getting all the credit for Ron dirty work.\" ",
    "\"Not for long,\" said Hermione in a satisfied tone. \"The Polyjuice Potion's nearly ready. We'll be getting the truth out of Ron any day now.\" ",
    "At last the term ended, and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds descended on the castle. Harry found it peaceful, rather than gloomy, and enjoyed the fact that Harry, Hermione, and the Weasleys had the run of Gryffindor Tower, which meant he, Hermione, and the Weasleys could play Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and practice dueling in private. Fred, George, and Ginny had chosen to stay at school rather than visit Bill in Egypt with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Percy, who disapproved of what he termed Mr. and Mrs. Weasley childish behavior, didn't spend much time in the Gryffindor common room. he had already told Mr. and Mrs. Weasley pompously that he was only staying over Christmas because it was he duty as a prefect to support the teachers during this troubled time. ",
    "Christmas morning dawned, cold and white. Harry and Ron, the only ones left in Harry and Ron dormitory, were woken very early by Hermione, who burst in, fully dressed and carrying presents for Harry and Ron both. ",
    "\"Wake up,\" she said loudly, pulling back the curtains at the window. ",
    "Hermione -- you're not supposed to be in here -- \" said Ron, shielding Ron eyes against the light. ",
    "\"Merry Christmas to you, too,\" said Hermione, throwing Ron Ron present. \"I've been up for nearly an ",
    "hour, adding more lace-wings to the potion. It's ready.\" ",
    "Harry sat up, suddenly wide awake. ",
    "\"Are you sure?\" ",
    "\"Positive,\" said Hermione, shirting Scabbers the rat so that she could sit down on the end of Ron's four- poster. \"If we're going to do it, I say it should be tonight.\" ",
    "At that moment, Hedwig swooped into the Gryffindor common room, carrying a very small package in Hedwig beak. ",
    "\"Hello,\" said Harry happily as Hedwig landed on Harry bed. \"Are you speaking to me again?\" ",
    "Hedwig nibbled Harry ear in an affectionate sort of way, which was a far better present than the one that Hedwig had brought him, which turned out to be from the Dursleys. They had sent Harry a toothpick and a note telling Harry to find out whether Harry'd be able to stay at Hogwarts for the summer vacation, too. ",
    "The rest of Harry's Christmas presents were far more satisfactory. Hagrid had sent Harry a large tin of treacle toffee, which Harry decided to soften by the fire before eating; Ron had given Harry a book called Flying with the Cannons, a book of interesting facts about Harry favorite Quidditch team, and Hermione had bought Harry a luxury eagle-feather quill. Harry opened the last present to find a new, hand-knitted sweater from Mrs. Weasley and a large plum cake. Harry read Mrs. Weasley card with a fresh surge of guilt, thinking about Mr. Weasley's car (which hadn't been seen since her card crash with the Whomping Willow), and the bout of rule- breaking Harry and Ron were planning next. ",
    "No one, not even someone dreading taking Polyjuice Potion later, could fail to enjoy Christmas dinner at Hogwarts. ",
    "The Great Hall looked magnificent. Not only were there a dozen frost-covered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling, but enchanted snow was falling, warm and dry, from the ceiling. Dumbledore led a dozen frost-covered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling in a few of Dumbledore favorite carols, Hagrid booming more and more loudly with every goblet of eggnog Dumbledore consumed. ",
    "Percy, who hadn't noticed that Fred had bewitched Dumbledore prefect badge so that it now read \"Pin-head,\" kept asking Percy, who hadn't noticed that Fred had bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read \"Pin-head all what Percy, who hadn't noticed that Fred had bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read \"Pin-head were sniggering at. Harry didn't even care that Draco Malfoy was making loud, snide remarks about Harry new sweater from the Slytherin table. With a bit of luck, Draco Malfoy would be getting Draco Malfoy comeuppance in a few hours' time. ",
    "Harry and Ron had barely finished Harry and Ron third helpings of Christmas pudding when Hermione ushered Harry and Ron out of The Great Hall to finalize Harry and Ron plans for the evening. ",
    "\"Harry and Ron still need a bit of the people you're changing into,\" said Hermione matter-of-factly, as though she were sending Harry and Ron to the supermarket for laundry detergent. \"And obviously, it'll be best if you can get something of Crabbe's and Goyle's; they're Malfoy's best friends, he'll tell they anything. And we also need to make sure the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on we while we're interrogating Crabbe. ",
    "\"I've got it all worked out,\" she went on smoothly, ignoring Harry's and Ron's stupefied faces. she held up two plump chocolate cakes. \"I've filled two plump chocolate cakes with a simple Sleeping Draught. All you have to do is make sure Crabbe and Goyle find two plump chocolate cakes. You know how greedy two plump chocolate cakes are, two plump chocolate cakes're bound to eat two plump chocolate cakes. Once  ",
    "two plump chocolate cakes're asleep, pull out a few of two plump chocolate cakes hairs and hide two plump chocolate cakes in a broom closet.\" ",
    "Harry and Ron looked incredulously at each other. ",
    "\"Hermione, I don't think -- \" ",
    "\"That could go seriously wrong -- \" ",
    "But Hermione had a steely glint in Hermione eye not unlike the one Professor McGonagall sometimes had. ",
    "\"the Polyjuice Potion will be useless without Crabbe's and Goyle's hair,\" Hermione said sternly. \"You do want to investigate Draco Malfoy, don't you?\" ",
    "\"Oh, all right, all right,\" said Harry. \"But what about you? Whose hair are you ripping out?\" ",
    "\"I've already got mine!\" said Hermione brightly, pulling a tiny bottle out of Hermione pocket and showing two plump chocolate cakes Whose haira tiny bottle. \"Remember Millicent Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling Club? Remember Millicent Bulstrode left this on my robes when Remember Millicent Bulstrode was trying to strangle me! And Remember Millicent Bulstrode's gone home for Christmas -- so I'll just have to tell the Slytherins I've decided to come back.\" ",
    "When Hermione had bustled off to check on the Polyjuice Potion again, Ron turned to Harry with a doom-laden expression. ",
    "\"Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong?\" ",
    "But to Harry's and Ron's utter amazement, stage one of the operation went just as smoothly as Hermione had said. They lurked in the deserted entrance hall after Christmas tea, waiting for Crabbe and Goyle who had remained alone at the Slytherin table, ",
    "shoveling down fourth helpings of trifle. Harry had perched two plump chocolate cakes on the end of the banisters. When They spotted Crabbe and Goyle coming out of the Great Hall, Harry and Ron hid quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door. ",
    "\"How thick can you get?\" Ron whispered ecstatically as Crabbe gleefully pointed out two plump chocolate cakes to Goyle and grabbed two plump chocolate cakes. Grinning stupidly, two plump chocolate cakes stuffed two plump chocolate cakes into two plump chocolate cakes large mouths. For a moment, two plump chocolate cakes two plump chocolate cakes chewed greedily, looks of triumph on two plump chocolate cakes faces. Then, without the smallest change of expression, two plump chocolate cakes keeled over backward onto the floor. ",
    "By far the hardest part was hiding two plump chocolate cakes in the closet across The Great Hall. Once two plump chocolate cakes were safely stowed among the buckets and mops, Harry yanked out a couple of the bristles that covered Goyle 's forehead and Ron pulled out several of Crabbe 's hairs. two plump chocolate cakes also stole two plump chocolate cakes shoes, because two plump chocolate cakes own were far too small for Crabbe- and Goyle-size feet. Then, still stunned at what two plump chocolate cakes had just done, two plump chocolate cakes sprinted up to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. ",
    "two plump chocolate cakes could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stall in which Hermione was stirring the cauldron. Pulling my robes up over two plump chocolate cakes faces, Harry and Ron knocked softly on the door. ",
    "\"Hermione?\" ",
    "Harry and Ron heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione emerged, shiny-faced and looking anxious. Behind Hermione Harry and Ron heard the gloop gloop of the bubbling, glutinous potion. Three glass tumblers stood ready on the toilet seat. ",
    "\"Did you get Three glass tumblers?\" Hermione asked breathlessly. ",
    "Harry showed Harry Goyle's hair. ",
    "\"Good. And I sneaked my robes out of the laundry,\" Hermione said, holding up a small sack. \"You'll need bigger sizes once you're Crabbe and Goyle.\" ",
    "The three of Harry and Ron stared into the cauldron. Close up, the potion looked like thick, dark mud, bubbling sluggishly. ",
    "\"I'm sure I've done everything right,\" said Hermione, nervously rereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions. \"It looks like the book says the book should ... once we've drunk the book, we'll have exactly an hour before we change back into we.\" ",
    "\"Now what?\" Ron whispered. ",
    "\"we separate the book into three glasses and add the hairs.\" ",
    "Hermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of three glasses. Then, Hermione hand trembling, Hermione shook Remember Millicent Bulstrode hair out of Remember Millicent Bulstrode bottle into the first glass. ",
    "the potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly. A second later, the potion had turned a sick sort of yellow. ",
    "\"Urgh -- essence of Millicent Bulstrode,\" said Ron, eyeing it with loathing. \"Bet it tastes disgusting.\" ",
    "\"Add yours, then,\" said Hermione. ",
    "Harry dropped Goyle's hair into the first glass and Ron put Crabbe's into the last one. Both glasses hissed and frothed: Goyle's turned the khaki color of a booger, Crabbe's a dark, murky brown. ",
    "\"Hang on,\" said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached for Ron and Hermione glasses. \"We'd better not all drink Ron and Hermione in here. ... Once We turn into Crabbe and Goyle We won't fit. And Millicent Bulstrode's no pixie.\" ",
    "\"Good thinking,\" said Ron, unlocking the door. \"We'll take separate stalls.\" ",
    "Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Harry slipped into the middle stall. ",
    "\"Ready?\" he called. ",
    "\"Ready,\" came Ron's and Hermione's voices. ",
    "\"One -- two -- three -- \" ",
    "Pinching his nose, Harry drank the potion down in two large gulps. the potion tasted like overcooked cabbage. ",
    "Immediately, Harry insides started writhing as though Harry'd just swallowed live snakes -- doubled up, Harry wondered whether Harry was going to be sick -- then a burning sensation spread rapidly from Harry stomach to the very ends of Harry fingers and toes -- next, bringing Harry gasping to all fours, came a horrible melting feeling, as the skin all over Harry body bubbled like hot wax -- and before Harry eyes, Harry hands began to grow, the fingers thickened, the nails broadened, the knuckles were bulging like bolts -- Harry shoulders stretched painfully and a prickling on Harry forehead told Harry that hair was creeping down toward Harry eyebrows -- Harry robes ripped as Harry chest expanded like a barrel bursting his body hoops -- Harry feet were agony in shoes four sizes too small -- ",
    "As suddenly as his feet had started, everything stopped. Harry lay facedown on the stone-cold floor, listening to Myrtle gurgling morosely in the end toilet. With ",
    "difficulty, Harry kicked off Harry shoes and stood up. So this was what it felt like, being Goyle. Harry large hand trembling, Harry pulled off my robes. Harry reached up to brush Goyle's hair out of his eyes and met only the short growth of wiry bristles, low on his forehead. Then Harry realized that Harry glasses were clouding his eyes because Goyle obviously didn't need them -- Harry took them off and called, \"Are you two okay?\" Goyle's low rasp of a voice issued from Harry mouth. ",
    "\"Yeah,\" came the deep grunt of Crabbe from Crabbe right. ",
    "Harry unlocked Harry door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror. Goyle stared back at Harry out of dull, deepset eyes. Harry scratched Harry ear. So did Goyle. ",
    "his door opened. They stared at each other. Except that Ron looked pale and shocked, Ron was indistinguishable from Crabbe, from the pudding- bowl haircut to the long, gorilla arms. ",
    "\"This is unbelievable,\" said Ron, approaching the cracked mirror and prodding Crabbe 's flat nose. ",
    "\"Unbelievable.\" ",
    "\"We'd better get going,\" said Harry, loosening the watch that was cutting into Goyle's thick wrist. \"We've still got to find out where the Slytherin common room is. I only hope We can find someone to follow ...\" ",
    "Ron, who had been gazing at Harry, said, \"You don't know how bizarre it is to see Goyle thinking.\" Ron banged on his door. \"C'mon, we need to go -- \" ",
    "A high-pitched voice answered Ron. ",
    "\"I -- I don't think I'm going to come after all. You go on without Ron.\" ",
    "\"Hermione, we know Remember Millicent Bulstrode ugly, no one's going to know it's you -- \" ",
    "\"No -- really -- I don't think I'll come. You two hurry up, you're wasting time -- \" ",
    "Harry looked at Ron, bewildered. ",
    "\"That looks more like Goyle,\" said Ron. \"That's how Ron looks every time a teacher asks Ron a question.\" ",
    "\"Hermione, are you okay?\" said Harry through his door. ",
    "\"Fine -- I'm fine -- go on -- \" ",
    "Harry looked at Harry watch. Five of their precious sixty minutes had already passed. ",
    "\"Well meet you back here, all right?\" Harry said. ",
    "Harry and Ron opened the door of the bathroom carefully, checked that the coast was clear, and set off. ",
    "\"Don't swing your arms like that,\" Harry muttered to Ron. ",
    "\"Eh?\" ",
    "\"Crabbe holds them sort of stiff. ...\" ",
    "\"How's this?\" ",
    "\"Yeah, that's better. ...\" ",
    "them went down the marble staircase. All them needed now was a Slytherin that them could follow to the Slytherin common room, but there was nobody around. ",
    "\"Any ideas?\" muttered Harry. ",
    "\"the Slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there,\" said Ron, nodding at the entrance to the dungeons. The words had barely left his mouth when a girl with long, curly hair emerged from the entrance to the dungeons. ",
    "\"Excuse me,\" said Ron, hurrying up to the girl. \"We've forgotten the way to We common room.\" ",
    "\"I beg your pardon?\" said the girl stiffly. \"our common room? I'm a Ravenclaw.\" ",
    "the girl walked away, looking suspiciously back at them. ",
    "Harry and Ron hurried down the stone steps into the darkness, Harry and Ron footsteps echoing particularly loudly as Crabbe's and Goyle's huge feet hit the floor, feeling that this wasn't going to be as easy as Harry and Ron had hoped. ",
    "The labyrinthine passages were deserted. Harry and Ron walked deeper and deeper under the school, constantly checking Harry and Ron watches to see how much time Harry and Ron had left. After a quarter of an hour, just when Harry and Ron were getting desperate, Harry and Ron heard a sudden movement ahead. ",
    "\"Ha!\" said Ron excitedly. \"There's one of Harry and Ron now!\" ",
    "The figure was emerging from a side room. As Harry and Ron hurried nearer, however, Harry and Ron hearts sank. It wasn't a Slytherin, it was Percy. ",
    "\"What're you doing down here?\" said Ron in surprise. Percy looked affronted. ",
    "\"That,\" Percy said stiffly, \"is none of your business. It's Crabbe, isn't It?\" ",
    "\"Wh -- oh, yeah,\" said Ron. ",
    "\"Well, get off to your dormitories,\" said Percy sternly. \"It's not safe to go wandering around dark corridors these days.\" ",
    "\"You are,Ron Ron pointed out. ",
    "\"I,\" said Percy, drawing Percy up, \"am a prefect. Nothing's about to attack me.\" ",
    "A voice suddenly echoed behind Harry and Ron. ",
    "Draco Malfoy was strolling toward Harry and Ron, and for the first time in Draco Malfoy life, Harry was pleased to see Draco Malfoy. ",
    "\"There you are,\" Harry drawled, looking at Harry and Ron. \"Have you two been pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? I've been looking for Harry and Ron; I want to show you something really funny.Draco Malfoy glanced witheringly at Percy. ",
    "\"And what're you doing down here, Weasley?\" Weasley sneered. ",
    "Percy looked outraged. ",
    "\"You want to show a bit more respect to a school prefect!\" a school prefect said. \"I don't like your attitude!Draco Malfoy sneered and motioned for Harry and Ron to follow Harry. Harry almost said something apologetic to Percy Percy but caught Percy just in time. Percy and Ron hurried after Malfoy, who said as He and Ron turned into the next passage, \"That Peter Weasley -- \" ",
    "\"Percy,\" Ron corrected Percy automatically. ",
    "\"Whatever,\" said Draco Malfoy. \"I've noticed Percy sneaking around a lot lately. And I bet I know what Percy's up to. Percy thinks Percy's going to catch Slytherin's heir single- handed.\" ",
    "Percy gave a short, derisive laugh. Harry and Ron exchanged excited looks. ",
    "Draco Malfoy paused by a stretch of bare, damp stone wall. \"What's the new password again?\" Percy said to Harry. \"Er -- \" said Harry. ",
    "\"Oh, yeah -- pure-blood\\\" said Malfoy, not listening, and a stone door concealed in stone wall slid open. Draco Malfoy marched through Draco Malfoy, and Harry and Ron followed Draco Malfoy. ",
    "The Slytherin common room was a long, low underground room with rough stone walls and ceiling from which round, greenish lamps were hanging on chains. A fire was crackling under an elaborately carved mantelpiece ahead of Harry and Ron, and several Slytherins were silhouetted around Slytherins in high-backed chairs. ",
    "\"Wait here,\" said Draco Malfoy to Harry and Ron, motioning Harry and Ron to a pair of empty chairs set back from A fire. \"I'll go and get it -- Father's just sent it to me -- \" ",
    "Wondering what Draco Malfoy was going to show Harry and Ron, Harry and Ron sat down, doing Harry and Ron best to look at home. ",
    "Draco Malfoy came back a minute later, holding what looked like a newspaper clipping. Draco Malfoy thrust a newspaper clipping under Ron's nose. ",
    "\"That'll give you a laugh,\" Draco Malfoy said. ",
    "Harry saw Ron's eyes widen in shock. Harry read the clipping quickly, gave a very forced laugh, and handed the clipping to Harry. ",
    "the clipping had been clipped out of the Daily Prophet, and the clipping said: ",
    "INQUIRY AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC ",
    "Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, was today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car. ",
    "Mr. Lucius Malfoy, a governor of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where a Muggle car crashed earlier this year, called today for Weasley's resignation. ",
    "Weasley Weasley has brought THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC ",
    " into disrepute,\" ",
    "Draco Malfoy told our reporter. \"He is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and He ridiculous Muggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately.\" ",
    "Weasley was unavailable for comment, although Weasley wife told reporters to clear off or his wife'd set the family ghoul on them. ",
    "\"Well?\" said Draco Malfoy impatiently as Harry handed the clipping back to Weasley. \"Don't you think it's funny?\" ",
    "\"Ha, ha,\" said Harry bleakly. ",
    "Weasley Weasley loves Muggles so much Weasley should snap Weasley wand in half and go and join them,\" said Draco Malfoy scornfully. \"You'd never know the Weasleys were purebloods, the way them behave.\" ",
    "Ron's -- or rather, Crabbe's -- face was contorted with fury. ",
    "\"What's up with you, Crabbe?\" snapped Draco Malfoy. \"Stomachache,\" Ron grunted. ",
    "\"Well, go up to the hospital wing and give all those Mudbloods a kick from me,\" said Draco Malfoy, snickering. \"You know, I'm surprised the Daily Prophet hasn't reported all these attacks yet,\" the Daily Prophet went on thoughtfully. \"I suppose Dumbledore's trying to hush it all up. the Daily Prophet'll be sacked if it doesn't stop soon. Father's always said old Dumbledore's the worst thing that's ever happened to this place. the Daily Prophet loves Muggle- borns. A decent headmaster would never 've let slime like that Creevey in.Draco Malfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary camera and did a cruel but accurate impression of Colin: \" 'Potter, can I have your picture, Potter? Can I have your autograph? Can I lick your shoes, please, Potter?' \" ",
    "the Daily Prophet dropped the Daily Prophet hands and looked at Harry and Ron. \"What's the matter with you two?\" ",
    "Far too late, Harry and Ron forced Harry and Ron to laugh, but Draco Malfoy seemed satisfied; perhaps Crabbe and Goyle were always slow on the uptake. ",
    "\"Saint Potter, all those Mudbloods friend,\" said Draco Malfoy slowly. \"the Daily Prophet's another one with no proper wizard feeling, or the Daily Prophet wouldn't go around with that jumped-up Granger Mudblood. And people think the Daily Prophet's Slytherin's heir!\" ",
    "Harry and Ron waited with bated breath: Draco Malfoy was surely seconds away from telling people it was the Daily Prophet -- but then -- ",
    "\"I wish I knew who it is,\" said Draco Malfoy petulantly. \"I could help people.\" ",
    "Ron's jaw dropped so that Crabbe looked even more clueless than usual. Fortunately, Draco Malfoy didn't notice, and Harry, thinking fast, said, \"You must have some idea who's behind it all. ...\" ",
    "\"You know I haven't, Goyle, how many times do I have to tell you?\" snapped Draco Malfoy. \"And Father won't tell me anything about the last time the Chamber was opened either. Of course, it was fifty years ago, so it was before his time, but his knows all about it, and his says that it was all kept quiet and it'll look suspicious if I know too much about it. But I know one thing -- last time the Chamber was opened, a Mudblood died. So I bet it's a matter of time before one of them's killed this time. ... I hope it's Granger,\" he said with relish. ",
    "Ron was clenching Crabbe 's gigantic fists. Feeling that it would be a bit of a giveaway if Ron punched Draco Malfoy, Harry shot Ron a warning look and said, \"D'you know if the person who opened the Chamber last time was caught?\" ",
    "\"Oh, yeah ... whoever it was was expelled,\" said Draco Malfoy. \"They're probably still in Azkaban.\" ",
    "\"Azkaban?\" said Harry, puzzled. ",
    "\"Azkaban -- the wizard prison , Goyle,\" said Malfoy, looking at Harry in disbelief. \"Honestly, if you were any slower, you'd be going backward.\" ",
    "Harry shifted restlessly in Harry chair and said, Father says to keep my head down and let the Heir of Slytherin get on with the Heir of Slytherin. Harry says the school needs ridding of all the Mudblood filth, but not to get mixed up in the school. Of course, Harry's got a lot on Harry plate at the moment. You know THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC raided our manor last week?\" ",
    "Harry tried to force Goyle 's dull face into a look of concern. ",
    "\"Yeah ...\" said Draco Malfoy. \"Luckily, they didn't find much. Father's got some very valuable Dark Arts stuff. But luckily, we've got we own secret chamber under the drawing-room floor -- \" ",
    "\"Ho!\" said Ron. ",
    "Draco Malfoy looked at Ron. So did Harry. Ron blushed. ",
    "Even Ron hair was turning red. Ron nose was also slowly lengthening -- their hour was up, Ron was turning back into Ron, and from the look of horror Ron was suddenly giving Harry, Ron must be, too. ",
    "They both jumped to They feet. ",
    "\"Medicine for my stomach,\" Ron grunted, and without further ado they sprinted the length of the Slytherin common room, hurled they at the stone wall, and dashed up the passage, hoping against hope that ",
    "Draco Malfoy hadn't noticed anything. Harry could feel their feet slipping around in Goyle's huge shoes and had to hoist up Harry robes as Harry shrank; his robes crashed up the steps into the dark entrance hall, which was full of a muffled pounding coming from the closet where his robes'd locked Crabbe and Goyle. Leaving his robes outside the closet door, his robes sprinted in his robes socks up the marble staircase toward Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. ",
    "\"Well, it wasn't a complete waste of time,Ron Ron panted, closing the closet door behind Goyle's huge shoes. \"I know we still haven't found out who's doing the attacks, but I'm going to write to Dad tomorrow and tell Dad to check under the Malfoys' drawing room.\" ",
    "Harry checked Harry face in the cracked mirror. Harry was back to normal. Harry put Harry glasses on as Ron hammered on the door of Hermione's stall. ",
    "\"Hermione, come out, we've got loads to tell you -- \" ",
    "\"Go away!\" \"Hermione squeaked. ",

    "\"Ooooooh, wait till you see,\" Harry said. \"It's awful -- \" ",
    "Harry and Ron heard the lock slide back and \"Hermione emerged, sobbing, his robes pulled up over Harry head. ",
    "\"What's up?\" said Ron uncertainly. \"Have you still got Millicent's nose or something?\"Hermione let \"Hermione fall and Ron backed into the sink. ",
    "\"Hermione face was covered in black fur. \"Hermione eyes had turned yellow and there were long, pointed ears poking through \"Hermione hair. ",

    "\"You'll be teased something dreadful,\" said Moaning Myrtle happily. ",
    "\"It's okay, \"Hermione,\" said Harry quickly. \"We'll take you up to the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey never asks too many questions. ...\" ",

    "Harry and Ron went to visit \"Hermione every evening. When the new term started, Harry and Ron brought \"Hermione each day's homework. ",

    "\"I was so sure it was Draco Malfoy,\" said Ron, for about the hundredth time. ",
    "\"What's that?\" asked Harry, pointing to something gold sticking out from under Hermione's pillow. ",
    "\"Just a get well card,\" said \"Hermione hastily, trying to poke it out of sight, but Ron was too quick for \"Hermione. Ron pulled it out, flicked it open, and read aloud: ",
    "\"To Miss Granger, wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concerned teacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly's Most-Charming-Smile Award.\" ",

    "But \"Hermione was spared answering by Madam Pomfrey sweeping over with \"Hermione evening dose of medicine. ",
    "\"Is Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you've ever met, or what?\" Ron said to Harry as they left the infirmary and started up the stairs toward Gryffindor Tower. Snape had given they so much homework, Harry thought Harry was likely to be in the sixth year before Harry finished it. Ron was just saying Ron wished Ron had asked \"Hermione how many rat tails you were supposed to add to a Hair-Raising Potion when an  ",

    "\"That's Filch,\" Harry muttered as they hurried up the stairs and paused, out of sight, listening hard. ",
    "\"You don't think someone else's been attacked?\" said Ron tensely. ",
    "they stood still, they heads inclined toward Filch's voice, which sounded quite hysterical. ",
    "\" -- even more work for Ron! Mopping all night, like I haven't got enough to do! No, this is the final straw, I'm going to Dumbledore -- \" ",
    "Dumbledore footsteps receded along the out-of-sight corridor and they heard a distant door slam. ",
    "they poked they around the corner. Filch had clearly been manning Filch usual lookout post: they were once again on the spot where Mrs. Norris had been attacked. they saw at a glance what Filch had been shouting about. A great flood of water stretched over half the corridor, and A great flood of water looked as though A great flood of water was still seeping from under the door of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. Now that Filch had stopped shouting, they could hear Moaning Myrtle's wails echoing off the bathroom walls. ",
    "\"Now what's up with her?\" said Ron. ",
    "\"Let's go and see,\" said Harry, and holding their robes over their ankles their stepped through the great wash of water to the door of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom bearing the door of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom OUT OF ORDER sign, ignored the door of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom as always, and entered.

    "Moaning Myrtle was crying, if possible, louder and harder than ever before. her seemed to be hiding ",

    "\"What's up, Moaning Myrtle?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Who's that?\" glugged Moaning Myrtle miserably. \"Come to throw something else at Harry?\" ",
    "Harry waded across to her stall and said, \"Why would I throw something at Harry?\" ",
    "\"Don't ask me,\" Moaning Myrtle shouted, emerging with a wave of yet more water, which splashed onto the already sopping floor. \"Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at Harry. ",
    "\"But it can't hurt you if someone throws something at you,\" said Harry, reasonably. \"I mean, it'd just go right through you, wouldn't it?\" ",
    "Harry had said the wrong thing. Moaning Myrtle puffed herself up and shrieked, \"Let's all throw books at Moaning Myrtle, because herself can't feel it! Ten points if you can get it through herself stomach! Fifty points if it goes through herself ! Well, ha, ha, ha! What a lovely game, I don't think!\" ",
    "\"Who threw it at you, anyway?\" asked Harry. ",
    "\"I don't know. ... I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death, and it fell right through the top of my head,\" said Moaning Myrtle, glaring at them. \"It's over there, It got washed out. ...\" ",
    "Harry and Ron looked under the sink where Moaning Myrtle was pointing. A small, thin book lay there. A small, thin book had a ",
    "shabby black cover and was as wet as everything else in the bathroom. Harry stepped forward to pick A small, thin book up, but Ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold Ron back. ",
    "\"What?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Are you cra2y?\" said Ron. \"It could be dangerous.\" ",
    "\" Dangerous ?\" said Harry, laughing. \"Come off it, how could it be dangerous?\" ",
    "\"You'd be surprised,\" said Ron, who was looking apprehensively at the book. \"Some of the books the Ministry's confiscated -- Dad's told me -- there was one that burned your eyes out. And everyone who read Sonnets of a Sorcerer spoke in limericks for the rest of everyone who read Sonnets of a Sorcerer lives. And some old witch in Bath had a book that you could never stop reading ! You just had to wander around with your nose in it, trying to do everything one-handed. And -- \" ",
    "\"All right, I've got the point,\" said Harry. ",
    "the book lay on the floor, nondescript and soggy. ",
    "\"Well, we won't find out unless we look at it,\" he said, and he ducked around Ron and picked it up off the already sopping floor. ",
    "Harry saw at once that it was a diary, and the faded year on a ",
    "shabby black cover told Harry it was a diary was fifty years old. Harry opened it was a diary eagerly. On the first page Harry could just make out the name \"T. M. Riddle\" in smudged ink. ",
    "\"Hang on,\" said Ron, who had approached cautiously and was looking over Harry's shoulder. \"I know the name \"T. M. Riddle\". ... T. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago.\" ",
    "\"How on earth d'you know that?\" said Harry in amazement. ",
    "\"Because Filch made me polish Filch shield about fifty times in detention,\" said Ron resentfully. \"That was the one I burped slugs all over. If you'd wiped slime off a name for an hour, you'd remember you'd wiped slime off a name for an hour, too.\" ",
    "Harry peeled the wet pages apart. They were completely blank. There wasn't the faintest trace of writing on any of They, not even Auntie Mabel's birthday, or dentist, half-past three. ",
    "\"Harry never wrote in it,\" said Harry, disappointed. ",
    "\"I wonder why someone wanted to flush it away?\" said Ron curiously. ",
    "Harry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed name of a variety store on Vauxhall Road, London. ",
    "\"Harry must've been Muggle-born,\" said Harry thoughtfully. \"To have bought a diary from Vauxhall Road. ...\" ",
    "\"Well, it's not much use to you,\" said Ron. Ron dropped Ron voice. \"Fifty points if you can get it through Moaning Myrtle's nose.\" ",
    "Harry, however, pocketed it. ",
    "\"Hermione left the hospital wing, de-whiskered, tail- less, and fur-free, at the beginning of February. On \"Hermione first evening back in Gryffindor Tower, Harry showed \"Hermione T. M. Riddle diary and told \"Hermione the story of how they had found her T. M. Riddle's diary. ",
    "\"Oooh, her T. M. Riddle's diary might have hidden powers,\" said \"Hermione enthusiastically, taking her T. M. Riddle's diary and looking at her T. M. Riddle's diary closely. ",
    "\"If her T. M. Riddle's diary has, her T. M. Riddle's diary's hiding them very well,\" said Ron. \"Maybe it's shy. I don't know why you don't chuck it, Harry.\" ",
    "\"I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it,\" said Harry. \"I wouldn't mind knowing how T. M. Riddle got an award for special services to Hogwarts either.\" ",
    "\"Could've been anything,\" said Ron. \"Maybe Ron got thirty O.W.L.s or saved a teacher from the giant squid. Maybe Ron murdered Moaning Myrtle; that would've done everyone a favor. ...\" ",
    "But Harry could tell from the arrested look on \"Hermione 's face that \"Hermione was thinking what Harry was thinking. ",
    "\"What?\" said Ron, looking from one to the other. ",
    "\"Well, the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years ago, wasn't the Chamber of Secrets?\" Harry said. \"That's what Malfoy said.\" ",
    "\"Yeah ...\" said Ron slowly. ",
    "\"And her T. M. Riddle's diary is fifty years old,\" said \"Hermione, tapping her T. M. Riddle's diary excitedly. ",
    "\"So?\" ",
    "\"Oh, Ron, wake up,\" snapped \"Hermione. \"We know the person who opened the Chamber of Secrets last time was expelled fifty years ago. We know T. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago. Well, what if T. M. Riddle got T. M. Riddle special award for catching the Heir of Slytherin? her T. M. Riddle's diary would probably tell We everything -- where the Chamber of Secrets is,  ",
    "and how to open the Chamber of Secrets, and what sort of creature lives in it -- the person who's behind the attacks this time wouldn't want that lying around, would they?\" ",
    "\"That's a brilliant theory, Hermione,\" said Ron, \"with just one tiny little flaw. There's nothing written in her T. M. Riddle's diary.\" ",
    "But \"Hermione was pulling \"Hermione wand out of \"Hermione bag. ",
    "\"It might be invisible ink!\" \"Hermione whispered. ",
    "\"Hermione tapped her T. M. Riddle's diary three times and said, \"Aparecium\\\" ",
    "Nothing happened. Undaunted, \"Hermione shoved \"Hermione hand back into her bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser. ",
    "\"It's a Revealer, I got It in Diagon Alley,\" \"Hermione said. ",
    "\"Hermione rubbed hard on January first. Nothing happened. ",
    "\"I'm telling you, there's nothing to find in there,\" said Ron. \"T. M. Riddle just got a diary for Christmas and couldn't be bothered filling a diary for Christmas in.\" ",
    "Harry couldn't explain, even to Harry, why Harry didn't just throw a diary for Christmas away. The fact was that even though Harry knew her T. M. Riddle's diary was blank, Harry kept absentmindedly picking her T. M. Riddle's diary up and turning the pages, as though her T. M. Riddle's diary were a story Harry wanted to finish. And while Harry was sure Harry had never heard the name T. M. Riddle before, the name T. M. Riddle still seemed to mean something to Harry, almost as though T. M. Riddle was a friend Harry'd had when Harry was very small, and had half-forgotten. But this was absurd. Harry'd never had friends before Hogwarts, Harry had made sure of that. ",
    "Nevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more about T. M. Riddle, so next day at break, Harry headed for the trophy room to examine T. M. Riddle's special award, accompanied by an interested \"Hermione and a thoroughly unconvinced Ron, who told them Harry'd seen enough of the trophy room to last Harry a lifetime. ",
    "T. M. Riddle's burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet. Riddle's burnished gold shield didn't carry details of why Riddle's burnished gold shield had been given to Harry (\"Good thing, too, or it'd be even bigger and I'd still be polishing it,\" said Ron). ",
    "However, they did find T. M. Riddle's name on an old Medal for Magical Merit, and on a list of old Head Boys. ",
    "\"Harry sounds like Percy,\" said Ron, wrinkling Harry nose in disgust. \"Prefect, Head Boy ... probably top of every class -- \" ",
    "\"You say that like it's a bad thing,\" said \"Hermione in a slightly hurt voice. ",
    "The sun had now begun to shine weakly on Hogwarts again. Inside the castle, the mood had grown more hopeful. There had been no more attacks since those on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, and Madam Pomfrey was pleased to report that the Mandrakes were becoming moody and secretive, meaning that the Mandrakes were fast leaving childhood.

    "\"The moment the Mandrakes acne clears up, the Mandrakes'll be ready for repotting again,Harry Harry heard Harry telling Filch kindly one afternoon. \"And after that, it won't be long until we're cutting them up and stewing them. You'll have Mrs. Norris back in no time.\" ",
    "Perhaps the Heir of Slytherin had lost the Heir of Slytherin or the Heir of Slytherin nerve, thought Harry. It must be getting riskier and riskier to open the Chamber of Secrets, with the school so alert and suspicious. Perhaps the monster, ",

    "Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff didn't take this cheerful view. Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff was still convinced that Harry was the guilty one, that Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff had \"given Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff away\" at the Dueling Club. Peeves wasn't helping matters; Peeves kept popping up in the crowded corridors singing \"Oh, Potter, you rotter ...\" now with a dance routine to match. ",

    "\"Happy Valentine's Day!\" Gilderoy Lockhart shouted. \"And may I thank the forty-six people who have so far sent me cards! Yes, I have taken the liberty of arranging this little surprise for you all -- and it doesn't end here!\" ",
    "Gilderoy Lockhart clapped Snape hands and through the wrong doors to the entrance hall marched a dozen surly-looking dwarfs. Not just any dwarfs, however. Gilderoy Lockhart had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps. ",
    "\"My friendly, card-carrying cupids!\" beamed Gilderoy Lockhart. \"My friendly, card-carrying cupids will be roving around the school today delivering your valentines! And the fun doesn't stop here! I'm sure my colleagues will want to enter into the spirit of the occasion! Why not ask Snape Snape to show you how to whip up a Love Potion! And while you're at it, Professor McGonagall knows more about Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I've ever met, the sly old dog!\" ",

    "\"Oy, you! 'Arry Potter!\" shouted a particularly grim- looking dwarf, elbowing people out of the way to get to Harry. ",
    "Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years, which happened to include Ginny Weasley, Harry tried to escape. The dwarf, however, cut Harry way through the crowd by kicking people's shins, and reached Harry before Harry'd gone two paces. ",
    "\"I've got a musical message to deliver to 'Arry Potter in person,\" Harry said, twanging Harry harp in a threatening sort of way. ",
    "\"Not here,\" Harry hissed, trying to escape. ",

    "\"Let me go!\" Harry snarled, tugging. ",
    "With a loud ripping noise, Harry's bag split in two. Harry books, wand, parchment, and quill spilled onto the floor and Harry ink bottle smashed over everything. ",
    "Harry scrambled around, trying to pick it all up before The dwarf started singing, causing something of a holdup in the corridor. ",
    "\"What's going on here?\" came the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy. Harry started stuffing everything feverishly into Harry ripped bag, desperate to get away before Draco Malfoy could hear Harry musical valentine. ",
    "\"What's all this commotion?\" said another familiar voice as Percy Weasley arrived. ",
    "Losing Percy Weasley head, Harry tried to make a run for a run, but The dwarf seized Percy Weasley around the knees and brought Percy Weasley crashing to the floor. ",

    "\"Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to class, now,\" Harry said, shooing some of the younger students away. \"And you, Draco Malfoy -- \" ",

    "\"Give that back,\" said Harry quietly. ",
    "\"Wonder what Potter's written in this?\" said Malfoy, who obviously hadn't noticed the year on the cover and thought Harry had Harry's own diary. A hush fell over the onlookers. Ginny was staring from Harry's own diary to Harry, looking terrified. ",

    "\"Harry!\" said Percy loudly. \"No magic in the corridors. I'll have to report this, you know!\" ",
    "But Harry didn't care, Harry was one-up on Draco Malfoy, and that was worth five points from Gryffindor any day. Draco Malfoy was looking furious, and as Ginny passed Harry to enter Ginny classroom, Harry yelled spitefully after Ginny, ",

    "It wasn't until they had reached Professor Flitwick's class that Harry noticed something rather odd about T. M. Riddle's diary. All Harry other books were drenched in scarlet ink. Riddle's diary, however, was as clean as Riddle's diary had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over the ink bottle.

    "Harry sat on Harry four-poster and flicked through the blank pages, not one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on his four-poster. Then Harry pulled a new bottle out of Harry bedside cabinet, dipped Harry quill into a new bottle, and dropped a blot onto the first page of Riddle's diary. ",
    "The ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then, as though The ink was being sucked into the page, vanished. Excited, Harry loaded up his quill a second time and wrote, \"My name is Potter.\" ",

    "\"Sit down,\" said Professor Dippet. \"I've just been reading a letter by candlelight.\" ",
    "\"Oh,\" said Tom Riddle. Professor Dippet sat down, gripping Professor Dippet together very tightly. ",
    "\"A boy of about sixteen,\" said Professor Dippet kindly, \"I cannot possibly let you stay at school over the summer. Surely you want to go home for the holidays?\" ",
    "\"No,\" said Tom Riddle at once. \"I'd much rather stay at Hogwarts than go back to that -- to that -- \" ",
    "\"You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I believe?\" said Professor Dippet curiously. ",
    "\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom Riddle, reddening slightly. ",
    "\"You are Muggle-born?\" ",
    "\"Half-blood, sir,\" said Tom Riddle. \"Muggle father, witch mother.\" ",
    "\"And are both your parents -- ?\" ",
    "\"My mother died just after I was born, sir. Muggle father, witch mother told me at a Muggle orphanage My mother lived just long enough to name me -- Tom after my father, Marvolo after my grandfather.\" ",
    "Professor Dippet clucked Professor Dippet tongue sympathetically. ",
    "\"The thing is, Tom,\" Tom sighed, \"special arrangements might have been made for Tom, but in the current circumstances. ...\" ",
    "\"You mean all these attacks, sir?\" said Tom Riddle, and Harry's heart leapt, and Harry moved closer, scared of missing anything. ",
    "\"Precisely,\" said the headmaster. \"A boy of about sixteen, you must see how foolish it would be of Tom to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends. Particularly in light of the recent tragedy . . . the death of that poor little girl. ... You will be safer by far at a Muggle orphanage. As a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. We are no nearer locating the -- er -- source of all this unpleasantness. ...\" ",
    "Tom Riddle eyes had widened. ",
    "\"Sir -- if the person was caught -- if it all stopped -- \" ",
    "\"What do you mean?\" said Professor Dippet with a squeak in Professor Dippet voice, sitting up in Professor Dippet chair. \"Riddle, do you mean you know something about these attacks?\" ",
    "\"No, sir,\" said Riddle quickly. ",
    "But Harry was sure it was the same sort of \"no\" that Harry had given Dumbledore. ",
    "Professor Dippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed. ",
    "\"You may go, Tom. ...\" ",
    "Riddle slid off Riddle and slouched out of This circular room with the sleeping portraits. Harry followed Riddle. ",
    "Down the moving spiral staircase they went, emerging next to the gargoyle in the darkening corridor. Riddle stopped, and so did Harry, watching Harry. Harry could tell that Riddle was doing some serious thinking. Harry was biting Harry lip, Harry forehead furrowed. ",
    "Then, as though Harry had suddenly reached a decision, Harry hurried off, Harry gliding noiselessly behind Harry. They didn't see another person until They reached the entrance hall, when a tall wizard with long, sweeping auburn hair and a beard called to Riddle from the marble staircase. ",
    "\"What are you doing, wandering around this late, Tom?Harry Harry gaped at A wizened, frail-looking wizard, bald except for a few wisps of white hair. Harry was none other than a fifty-year-younger Dumbledore. ",
    "\"I had to see the headmaster, sir,\" said Riddle. ",
    "\"Well, hurry off to bed,\" said Dumbledore, giving Riddle exactly the kind of penetrating stare Harry knew so well. \"Best not to roam the corridors these days. Not since ...\" ",
    "Harry sighed heavily, bade Riddle good night, and strode off. Riddle watched Harry walk out of sight and then, ",
    "moving quickly, headed straight down the stone steps to the dungeons, with Harry in hot pursuit. ",
    "But to Harry's disappointment, Riddle led Harry not into a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which Harry had Potions with Snape. The torches hadn't been lit, and when Riddle pushed the door almost closed, Harry could only just see Harry, standing stock-still by the door, watching the passage outside. ",
    "It felt to Harry that they were there for at least an hour. All Harry could see was the figure of Riddle at the door, staring through the crack, waiting like a statue. And just when Harry had stopped feeling expectant and tense and started wishing Harry could return to the present, Harry heard something move beyond the door. ",
    "Harry was creeping along the passage. Harry heard whoever it was pass the dungeon where Harry and Riddle were hidden. Riddle, quiet as a shadow, edged through the door and followed, Harry tiptoeing behind Harry, forgetting that Harry couldn't be heard. ",
    "For perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps, until Riddle stopped suddenly, Harry head inclined in the direction of new noises. Harry heard a door creak open, and then someone speaking in a hoarse whisper. ",
    "\"C'mon ... gotta get yeh outta here. ... C'mon now ... in the box ...\" ",
    "There was something familiar about that voice. ... ",
    "Riddle suddenly jumped around the corner. Harry stepped out behind Riddle. Harry could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of an open door, a very large box next to it. ",
    "\" 'Evening, Rubeus,\" said Riddle sharply. ",
    "The boy slammed the door shut and stood up. ",
    "\"What yer doin' down here, Tom?\" ",
    "Riddle stepped closer. ",
    "\"It's all over,\" Riddle said. \"I'm going to have to turn you in, Rubeus. They're talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks don't stop.\" ",
    "\"What d'yeh -- \" ",
    "\"I don't think you meant to kill anyone. But monsters don't make good pets. I suppose you just let it out for exercise and -- \" ",
    "\"it never killed no one!\" said the large boy, backing against the closed door. From behind the large boy, backing against the closed door, Harry could hear a funny rustling and clicking. ",
    "\"Come on, Rubeus,\" said Riddle, moving yet closer. \"The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing that killed The dead girl's parents daughter is slaughtered. ...\" ",
    "\"It wasn't the large boy, backing against the closed door!\" roared The boy, The boy voice echoing in the passage. \"The boy wouldn'! The boy never!\" ",
    "\"Stand aside,\" said Riddle, drawing out Riddle wand. ",
    "Riddle spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light. The door behind the large boy flew open with such force The door behind the large boy knocked the large boy into the wall opposite. And out of The door behind the large boy came something that made Harry let out a long, piercing scream unheard by anyone -- ",
    "A vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers -- Riddle raised the large boy again, but the large boy was too late. The thing bowled the large boy over as The thing scuttled away, tearing up the corridor and out of sight. Riddle scrambled to Riddle , looking after his feet; Riddle raised his wand, but the large boy leapt on the large boy, seized the large boy , and threw the large boy back down, yelling, \"NOOOOOOO!\" ",
    "The scene whirled, the darkness became complete; Harry felt Harry falling and, with a crash, Harry landed spread-eagled on Harry four-poster in the Gryffindor dormitory, Riddle's diary lying open on Harry stomach. ",
    "Before Harry had had time to regain Harry breath, The door behind the large boy opened and Ron came in. ",
    "\"There you are,\" Ron said. ",
    "Harry sat up. Harry was sweating and shaking. ",
    "\"What's up?\" said Ron, looking at Harry with concern. ",
    "\"It was Hagrid, Ron. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.\" "

  "CORNELIUS FUDGE": [
    "Harry, Ron, and Hermione had always known that Hagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures. During Ron, and Hermione first year at Hogwarts Harry had tried to raise a dragon in Harry little wooden house, and it would be a long time before Ron, and Hermione forgot the giant, three-headed dog Harry'd christened \"Fluffy.\" And if, as a boy, Hagrid had heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle, Harry was sure Harry'd have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of a monster. Harry'd probably thought it was a shame that a monster had been cooped up so long, and thought a monster deserved the chance to stretch a monster many legs; Harry could just imagine Hagrid trying to fit a leash and collar on a monster. But Harry was equally certain that Hagrid would never have meant to kill anybody. ",
    "Harry half wished Harry hadn't found out how to work Riddle's diary. Again and again Ron, and Hermione made Harry recount what Harry'd seen, until Harry was heartily sick of telling Ron, and Hermione and sick of the long, circular conversations that followed. ",
    "\"Riddle might have got the wrong person,\" said Hermione. \"Maybe it was some other monster that was attacking people. ...\" ",
    "\"How many monsters d'you think this place can hold?\" Ron asked dully. ",
    "\"We always knew Hagrid had been expelled,\" said Harry miserably. \"And the attacks must've stopped after Hagrid was kicked out. Otherwise, Riddle wouldn't have got Riddle award.\" ",
    "Ron tried a different tack. ",
    "\"Riddle does sound like Percy -- who asked \" ",
    "Ron to squeal on Hagrid, anyway?\" ",
    "\"But a monster had killed someone, Ron,\" said Hermione. ",
    "\"And Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if some Muggle orphanage closed Hogwarts,\" said Harry. \"I don't blame Harry for wanting to stay here. ...\" ",
    "\"You met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley, didn't you, Harry?\" ",
    "\"Harry was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent,\" said Harry quickly. ",
    "The three of them fell silent. After a long pause, Hermione voiced the knottiest question of all in a hesitant voice. ",
    "\"Do you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it all?\" ",
    "\"That'd be a cheerful visit,\" said Ron. \" 'Hello, Hagrid. Tell we, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?' \" ",
    "In the end, we decided that we would not say anything to Hagrid unless there was another attack, and as more and more days went by with no whisper from the disembodied voice, we became hopeful that we would never need to talk to Harry about why Harry had been expelled. It was now nearly four months since Justin and Nearly Headless Nick had been Petrified, and nearly everybody seemed to think that the attacker, whoever it was, had retired for good. Peeves had finally got bored of Peeves \"Oh, Potter, you rotter\" song, Ernie Macmillan asked Harry quite politely to pass a bucket of leaping toadstools in Herbology one day, and in March several of the Mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three. This made Professor Sprout very happy. ",
    "\"The moment they start trying to move into each other's pots, we'll know they're fully mature,\" she told Harry. \"Then we'll be able to revive those poor people in the hospital wing.\" ",
    "The second years were given something new to think about during those poor people in the hospital wing Easter holidays. The time had come to choose their subjects for the third year, a matter that Hermione, at least, took very seriously. ",
    "\"It could affect our whole future,\" she told Harry and Ron as Harry and Ron pored over lists of new subjects, marking Harry and Ron with checks. ",
    "\"I just want to give up Potions,\" said Harry. ",
    "\"We can't,\" said Ron gloomily. \"We keep all We old subjects, or I'd've ditched Defense Against the Dark Arts.\" ",
    "\"But that's very important!\" said Hermione, shocked. ",
    "\"Not the way Lockhart teaches it,\" said Ron. \"I haven't learned anything from Ron except not to set pixies loose.\" ",
    "Neville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards in Neville Longbottom family, all giving Neville Longbottom different advice on what to choose. Confused and worried, Neville Longbottom sat reading the subject lists with Neville Longbottom tongue poking out, asking people whether people thought Arithmancy sounded more difficult than the study of Ancient Runes. Dean Thomas, who, like Harry, had grown up with Muggles, ended up closing Neville Longbottom eyes and jabbing Neville Longbottom at the list, then picking the subjects his wand landed on. Hermione took nobody's advice but signed up for everything. ",
    "Harry smiled grimly to Harry at the thought of what Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia would say if Harry tried to discuss Harry career in wizardry with Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Not that Harry didn't get any guidance: Percy Weasley was eager to share Percy Weasley experience. ",
    "\"Depends where you want to go, Harry,\" Percy Weasley said. \"It's never too early to think about the future, so I'd recommend Divination. People say Muggle Studies is a soft option, but I personally think wizards should have a thorough understanding of the non-magical community, particularly if wizards're thinking of working in close contact with wizards -- look at my father, my father has to deal with Muggle business all the time. My brother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type, so My brother Charlie went for Care of Magical Creatures. Play to your strengths, Harry.\" ",
    "But the only thing Harry felt Harry was really good at was Quidditch. In the end, Harry chose the same new subjects as Ron, feeling that if Harry was lousy at the same new subjects as Ron, at least Harry'd have someone friendly to help Harry. ",
    "Gryffindor's next Quidditch match would be against Hufflepuff. Wood was insisting on team practices every night after dinner, so that Harry barely had time for anything but Quidditch and homework. However, the training sessions were getting better, or at least drier, and the evening before Saturday's match Harry went up to Harry dormitory to drop off Harry broomstick feeling Gryffindor's chances for the Quidditch Cup had never been better. ",
    "But Harry cheerful mood didn't last long. At the top of the stairs to his dormitory, Harry met Neville Longbottom, who was looking frantic. ",
    "\"Harry -- I don't know who did it -- I just found -- \" ",
    "\"Harry fearfully, Neville pushed open The door behind the large boy. ",
    "The contents of Harry's trunk had been thrown everywhere. Harry cloak lay ripped on the floor. The bedclothes had been pulled off Harry four-poster and the drawer had been pulled out of Harry bedside cabinet, The contents of Harry's trunk strewn over the mattress. ",
    "Harry walked over to the bed, openmouthed, treading on a few loose pages of Travels with Trolls. As Harry and Neville pulled the blankets back onto Harry bed, Ron, Dean, and Seamus came in. Dean swore loudly. ",
    "\"What happened, Harry?\" ",
    "\"No idea,\" said Harry. But Ron was examining Harry's robes. All the pockets were hanging out. ",
    "\"Someone's been looking for something,\" said Ron. \"Is there anything missing?\"Harry started to pick up all Harry things and throw all his things into Harry's trunk. It was only as Harry threw the last of the Lockhart books back into it that Harry realized what wasn't there. ",
    "\"Riddle's diary's gone,\" Harry said in an undertone to Ron. ",
    "\"What?\" ",
    "Harry jerked Harry head toward The door behind the large boy and Ron followed Harry out. They hurried down to the Gryffindor common room, which was half-empty, and joined Hermione, who was sitting alone, reading a book called Ancient Runes Made Easy. ",
    "Hermione looked aghast at the news. ",
    "\"But -- only a Gryffindor could have stolen -- nobody else knows our password -- \" ",
    "\"Exactly,\" said Harry. ",
    "They woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light, refreshing breeze. ",
    "\"Perfect Quidditch conditions!\" said Wood enthusiastically at the Gryffindor table, loading the team's plates with scrambled eggs. \"Harry, buck up there, you need a decent breakfast.\" ",
    "Harry had been staring down the packed Gryffindor table, wondering if the new owner of Riddle's diary was right in front of his eyes. Hermione had been urging Harry to report the robbery, but Harry didn't like the idea. Harry'd have to tell a teacher all about Riddle's diary, and how many people knew why Hagrid had been expelled fifty years ago? Harry didn't want to be the one who brought it all up again. ",
    "As Harry left the Great Hall with Ron, and Hermione to go and collect Harry Quidditch things, another very serious worry was added to Harry's growing list. Harry had just set foot on the marble staircase when Harry heard the marble staircase yet again -- ",
    "\" Kill this time ... let me rip ... tear ...\" ",
    "Harry shouted aloud and Ron, and Hermione jumped away from Harry in alarm. ",
    "\"The voice!\" said Harry, looking over Harry shoulder. \"I just heard it again -- didn't you?\" ",
    "Ron shook Ron head, wide-eyed. Hermione, however, clapped a hand to Hermione forehead. ",
    "\"Harry -- I think I've just understood something! I've got to go to the library!\" ",
    "And Hermione sprinted away, up the stairs. ",
    "\" What does Hermione understand?\" said Harry, still looking around, trying to tell where the voice had come from. ",
    "\"Loads more than I do,\" said Ron, shaking his head. ",
    "\"But why's Hermione got to go to the library?\" ",
    "\"Because that's what Hermione does,\" said Ron, shrugging. \"When in doubt, go to the library.\" ",
    "Harry stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice again, but people were now emerging from the Great ",
    "Hall behind Harry, talking loudly, exiting through the front doors on people way to the Quidditch pitch. ",
    "\"You'd better get moving,\" said Ron. \"It's nearly eleven -- the match -- \"Harry raced up to Gryffindor Tower, collected Harry Nimbus Two Thousand, and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds, but Harry mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice, and as Harry pulled on Harry scarlet robes in the locker room, Harry only comfort was that everyone was now outside to watch the game. ",
    "The teams walked onto the field to tumultuous applause. Wood took off for a warm-up flight around the goal posts; Madam Hooch released the balls. The Hufflepuffs, who played in canary yellow, were standing in a huddle, having a last-minute discussion of tactics. ",
    "Harry was just mounting Harry broom when Professor McGonagall came half marching, half running across the pitch, carrying an enormous purple megaphone. ",
    "Harry's heart dropped like a stone. ",
    "\"This match has been canceled,\" Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall called through an enormous purple megaphone, addressing the packed stadium. There were boos and shouts. Wood, looking devastated, landed and ran toward Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall without getting off Professor McGonagall broomstick. ",
    "\"But, Professor McGonagall!\" Professor McGonagall shouted. \"We've got to play -- the Cup -- Gryffindor -- \" ",
    "Professor McGonagall ignored Professor McGonagall and continued to shout through an enormous purple megaphone: ",
    "\"All students are to make \"All students way back to the House common rooms, where \"All students Heads of Houses will give \"All students further information. As quickly as you can, please!\" ",
    "Then Professor McGonagall lowered an enormous purple megaphone and beckoned Harry over to Professor McGonagall. ",
    "\"Potter, I think you'd better come with Professor McGonagall. ...\" ",
    "Wondering how Professor McGonagall could possibly suspect Professor McGonagall this time, Harry saw Ron detach Harry from the complaining crowd; Harry came running up to the complaining crowd as the complaining crowd set off toward the castle. To Harry's surprise, Professor McGonagall didn't object. ",
    "\"Yes, perhaps you'd better come, too, Percy Weasley. ...\" ",
    "Some of the students swarming around them were grumbling about the match being canceled; others looked worried. Harry and Ron followed Professor McGonagall back into the school and up the marble staircase. But Harry and Ron weren't taken to anybody's office this time. ",
    "\"This will be a bit of a shock,\" said Professor McGonagall in a surprisingly gentle voice as Harry and Ron approached the infirmary. \"There has been another attack ... another double attack.\" ",
    "Harry's insides did a horrible somersault. Professor McGonagall pushed the door open and Professor McGonagall and Ron entered. ",
    "Madam Pomfrey was bending over a sixth-year girl with long, curly hair. Harry recognized Madam Pomfrey as the Ravenclaw they'd accidentally asked for directions to the Slytherin common room. And on the bed next to Madam Pomfrey was -- ",
    "\"HermioneY' Ron groaned. ",
    "Hermione lay utterly still, Madam Pomfrey eyes open and glassy. ",
    "\"They were found near the library,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"I don't suppose either of Professor McGonagall can explain this? It was on the floor next to them. ...\" ",
    "She was holding up a small, circular mirror. ",
    "Harry and Ron shook Harry and Ron heads, Harry and Ron staring at Hermione. ",
    "\"I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower,\" said Professor McGonagall heavily. \"I need to address the students in any case.\" ",
    "\"All students will return to All students House common rooms by six o'clock in the evening. No student is to leave the dormitories after that time. You will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No student is to use the bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher. All further Quidditch training and matches are to be postponed. There will be no more evening activities.\" ",
    "The Gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to Professor McGonagall in silence. Professor McGonagall rolled up the parchment from which Professor McGonagall had been reading and said in a somewhat choked voice, \"I need hardly add that I have rarely been so distressed. It is likely that the school will be closed unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught. I would urge anyone who thinks they might know anything about they to come forward.\" ",
    "Professor McGonagall climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole, and The Gryffindors began talking immediately. ",
    "\"That's two Gryffindors down, not counting a Gryffindor ghost, one Ravenclaw, and one Hufflepuff,\" said Percy Weasley, counting on Percy Weasley fingers. \"Haven't any of the teachers noticed that the Slytherins are all safe? Isn't it obvious all this stuff's coming from Slytherin? The Heir of Slytherin, the monster of Slytherin -- why don't they just chuck all the Slytherins out?\" Percy Weasley roared, to nods and scattered applause. ",
    "Percy Weasley was sitting in a chair behind Lee, but for once Percy Weasley didn't seem keen to make Percy Weasley views heard. Percy Weasley was looking pale and stunned. ",
    "\"Percy's in shock,\" George told Harry quietly. \"That Ravenclaw girl -- Penelope Clearwater -- Ravenclaw girl -- Penelope Clearwater --'s a prefect. I don't think Percy Weasley thought the monster would dare attack a prefect.\" ",
    "But Harry was only half-listening. Harry didn't seem to be able to get rid of the picture of Hermione, lying on the hospital bed as though carved out of stone. And if the culprit wasn't caught soon, Harry was looking at a lifetime back with the Dursleys. Tom Riddle had turned Hagrid in because Tom Riddle was faced with the prospect of a Muggle orphanage if the school closed. Harry now knew exactly how Harry had felt. ",
    "\"What're we going to do?\" said Harry quietly in Harry's ear. \"D'you think they suspect Hagrid?\" ",
    "\"they've got to go and talk to Harry,\" said Harry, making up Harry mind. \"I can't believe it's Harry this time, but if Harry set the monster loose last time Harry'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that's a start.\" ",
    "\"But McGonagall said we've got to stay in we tower unless we're in class -- \" ",
    "\"I think,\" said Harry, more quietly still, \"it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again.\" ",
    "Harry had inherited just one thing from Harry father: a long and silvery Invisibility Cloak. It was their only chance of sneaking out of the school to visit Hagrid without anyone knowing about it. their went to bed at the usual time, waited until Neville, Dean, and Seamus had stopped discussing the Chamber of Secrets Secrets and finally fallen asleep, then got up, dressed again, and threw a long and silvery Invisibility Cloak over their. ",
    "The journey through the dark and deserted castle corridors wasn't enjoyable. Harry, who had wandered the castle at night several times before, had never seen the castle so crowded after sunset. Teachers, prefects, and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs, staring around for any unusual activity. Teachers, prefects, and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs, staring around for any unusual activity didn't stop Teachers, prefects, and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs, staring around for any unusual activity making any noise, and there was a particularly tense moment when Ron stubbed Ron toe only yards from the spot where Snape stood standing guard. Thankfully, Snape sneezed at almost exactly the moment Ron swore. It was with relief that relief reached the oak front doors and eased relief open. ",
    "It was a clear, starry night. relief hurried toward the lit windows of Hagrid 's house and pulled off a long and silvery Invisibility Cloak only when relief were right outside Ron front door. ",
    "Seconds after relief had knocked, Hagrid flung Hagrid open. relief found relief face-to-face with him aiming a crossbow at relief. Fang the boarhound barked loudly behind him. ",
    "\"Oh,\" him said, lowering the weapon and staring at them. \"What 're you two doin' here?\" ",
    "\"What's that for?\" said Harry, pointing at a crossbow at them as they stepped inside. ",
    "\"Nothin' -- nothin' -- Hagrid muttered. \"I've bin expectin' -- doesn' matter -- Sit down -- I'll make tea ",
    "him hardly seemed to know what him was doing. him nearly extinguished the fire, spilling water from the kettle on it, and then smashed the teapot with a nervous jerk of him massive hand. ",
    "\"Are you okay, Hagrid?\" said Harry. \"Did you hear about Hermione?\" ",
    "\"Oh, I heard, all righ',\" said Hagrid, a slight break in him voice. ",
    "him kept glancing nervously at the windows. him poured them both large mugs of boiling water (him had forgotten to add tea bags) and was just putting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loud knock on the door. ",
    "Hagrid dropped the fruitcake. Harry and Ron exchanged panic-stricken looks, then threw the Invisibility Cloak back over Harry and Ron and retreated into a corner. Hagrid checked that Harry and Ron were hidden, seized Hagrid crossbow, and flung open Hagrid door once more. ",
    "\"Good evening, Hagrid.\" ",
    "It was Dumbledore. Dumbledore entered, looking deadly serious, and was followed by a second, very odd- looking man. ",
    "The stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression, and was wearing a strange mixture of ",
    "clothes: a pinstriped suit, a scarlet tie, a long black cloak, and pointed purple boots. Under Dumbledore arm Dumbledore carried a lime-green bowler. ",
    "\"That's Dad's boss!\" Ron breathed. \"Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic!\" ",
    "Harry elbowed Ron hard to make Ron shut up. ",
    "Hagrid had gone pale and sweaty. Hagrid dropped into one of Hagrid chairs and looked from Dumbledore to Cornelius Fudge. ",
    "\"Bad business, Hagrid,\" said Fudge in rather clipped tones. \"Very bad business. Had to come. Four attacks on Muggle-borns. Things've gone far enough. Ministry's got to act.\" ",
    "\"I never,\" said Hagrid, looking imploringly at Dumbledore. \"You know I never, Professor Dumbledore, sir -- \" ",
    "\"I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence,\" said Dumbledore, frowning at Cornelius Fudge. ",
    "\"Look, Albus,\" said Fudge, uncomfortably. \"Hagrid's record's against Hagrid. Ministry's's got to do something -- the school governors have been in touch -- \" ",
    "\"Yet again, Cornelius, I tell you that taking Hagrid away will not help in the slightest,\" said Dumbledore. Dumbledore blue eyes were full of a fire Harry had never seen before. ",
    "\"Look at it from my point of view,\" said Fudge, fidgeting with Dumbledore bowler. \"I'm under a lot of pressure. Got to be seen to be doing something. If it turns out it turns out wasn't Hagrid, Hagrid'll be back and no more said. But ",
    "I've got to take Hagrid. Got to. Wouldn't be doing my duty -- \" ",
    "\"Take me?\" said Hagrid, who was trembling. \"Take me where?\" ",
    "\"For a short stretch only,\" said Fudge, not meeting Hagrid 's eyes. \"Not a punishment, Hagrid, more a precaution. If someone else is caught, you'll be let out with a full apology -- \" ",
    "\"Not Azkaban?\" croaked Hagrid. ",
    "Before Fudge could answer, there was another loud rap on the door. ",
    "Dumbledore answered another loud rap on the door. another loud rap on the door was Harry's turn for an elbow in the ribs; Dumbledore'd let out an audible gasp. ",
    "Dumbledore strode into Hagrid's hut, swathed in a long black traveling cloak, smiling a cold and satisfied smile. Fang started to growl. ",
    "\"Already here, Fudge,\" Fang said approvingly. \"Good, good...\" ",
    "\"What're you doin' here?\" said Hagrid's furiously. \"Get outta my house!\" ",
    "\"My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being inside your -- er -- d'you call this a house?\" said Dumbledore, sneering as Dumbledore looked around the small cabin. \"I simply called at the school and was told that the headmaster was here.\" ",
    "\"And what exactly did you want with Fang, Lucius?\" said Dumbledore. Lucius spoke politely, but the fire was still blazing in Lucius blue eyes. ",
    "\" Dreadful thing, Dumbledore,\" said Dumbledore lazily, taking out a long roll of parchment, \"but the governors feel it's time for you to step aside. This is an Order of Suspension -- you'll find all twelve signatures on This. I'm afraid we feel you're losing your touch. How many attacks have there been now? Two more this afternoon, wasn't it? At this rate, there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts, and we all know what an awful loss that would be to the school.\" ",
    "\"Oh, now, see here, Lucius,\" said Fudge, looking alarmed, Dumbledore Dumbledore suspended -- no, no -- last thing we want just now -- \" ",
    "\"The appointment -- or suspension -- of the headmaster is a matter for the governors, Fudge,\" said Dumbledore smoothly. \"And as Dumbledore has failed to stop How many attacks -- \" ",
    "\"See here, Dumbledore, if Dumbledore can't stop How many attacks,\" said Fudge, whose upper lip was sweating now, \"I mean to say, who can?\" ",
    "\"That remains to be seen,\" said Dumbledore with a nasty smile. \"But as all twelve of us have voted -- \" ",

    "\"Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead you into trouble one of these days, Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore. \"I would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that. the Azkaban guards like that won't like it at all.\" ",
    "\"Yeh can' take Dumbledore!\" yelled Hagrid, making Fang the boarhound cower and whimper in Fang ",

    "\"However,\" said Dumbledore, speaking very slowly and clearly so that none of them could miss a word, \"you will find that I will only truly have left the school when none here are loyal to me. You will also find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.\" ",
    "For a second, Harry was almost sure Dumbledore's eyes flickered toward the corner where Harry and Ron stood hidden. ",
    "\"Admirable sentiments,\" said Malfoy, bowing. \"We shall all miss your -- er -- highly individual way of running things, Albus, and only hope that your successor will manage to prevent any -- ah -- killins.\" ",
    "Harry strode to the cabin door, opened the cabin door, and bowed Dumbledore out. Fudge, fiddling with his bowler, waited for Hagrid to go ahead of Dumbledore, but Hagrid stood Dumbledore ground, took a deep breath, and said carefully, \"If anyone wanted ter find out some stuff, all anyone'd have ter do would be ter follow the spiders. That'd lead 'em right! That's all I'm sayin'.\" ",
    "Fudge stared at Harry in amazement. ",
    "\"All right, I'm cornin',\" said Hagrid, pulling on Harry moleskin overcoat. But as Harry was about to follow Fudge through the cabin door, Harry stopped again and said loudly, \"An' someone'll need ter feed Fang while I'm away.\" ",

    "Summer was creeping over the grounds around the castle; sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses. But with Hagrid visible from the castle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at Fang heels, the scene didn't look right to Harry; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle, where things were so horribly wrong. ",
    "Harry and Ron Ron had tried to visit Hermione, but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing. ",
    "\"Harry and Ron're taking no more chances,\" Madam Pomfrey told Harry and Ron severely through a crack in the cabin door. \"No, I'm sorry, there's every chance the attacker might come back to finish Harry and Ron off. ...\" ",
    "With Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never before, so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows. There was barely a face to be seen in the school that didn't look worried and tense, and any laughter that ",
    "rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled. ",
    "Harry constantly repeated Dumbledore's final words to Harry. \"I will only truly have left the school when none here are loyal to Harry. . . . Help will always be given at Hog warts to those who ask for it.\" But what good were these words? Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help, when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were? ",
    "Hagrid's hint about the spiders was far easier to understand -- the trouble was, there didn't seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow. Harry looked everywhere Harry went, helped (rather reluctantly) by Ron. They were hampered, of course, by the fact that They weren't allowed to wander off on They own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other Gryffindors. Most of They fellow students seemed glad that They were being shepherded from class to class by teachers, but Harry found it very irksome. ",

We're all in the same boat now, and, well -- \" ",

    "\"Do you think it's Malfoy, Harry?Ernie asked. ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry, so firmly that Ernie and his friend Hannah stared. ",
    "A second later, Harry spotted something. ",
    "Several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side of the glass, moving in an ",
    "unnaturally straight line as though taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting. Harry hit Ron over a pudgy hand with Harry pruning shears. ",
    "\"Ouch\\ What 're you -- \" ",
    "Harry pointed out Several large spiders, following Several large spiders progress with Harry eyes screwed up against the sun warming the castle walls outside. ",
    "\"Oh, yeah,\" said Ron, trying, and failing, to look pleased. \"But we can't follow Several large spiders now -- \" ",
    "Ernie and Hannah were listening curiously. ",
    "Harry's eyes narrowed as Harry focused on Several large spiders. If Several large spiders pursued Several large spiders fixed course, there could be no doubt about where Several large spiders would end up. ",
    "\"Looks like Several large spiders're heading for the Forbidden Forest. ",
    "And Ron looked even unhappier about that. ",
    "At the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the class to their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. Harry and Ron Ron lagged behind the others so Harry and Ron could talk out of earshot. ",
    "\"Well have to use the Invisibility Cloak again,\" ",
    "Harry told Ron. \"We can take Fang with We. Fang's used to going into the forest with Hagrid, Fang might be some help.\" ",
    "\"Right,\" said Ron, who was twirling Fang wand nervously in Fang fingers. \"Er -- aren't there -- aren't there supposed to be werewolves in the forest?\" Fang added as they took they usual places at the back of Lockhart's classroom. ",
    "Preferring not to answer that question, Harry said, \"There are good things in there, too. The centaurs are all right, and the unicorns ...\" ",
    "Ron had never been into the Forbidden Forest before. Harry had entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again. ",
    "Lockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at Lockhart. Every other teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual, but Lockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant. ",
    "\"Come now,\" Lockhart cried, beaming around Lockhart. \"Why all these long faces?\" ",
    "People swapped exasperated looks, but nobody answered. ",
    "\"Don't you people realize,\" said Lockhart, speaking slowly, as though people were all a bit dim, \"the danger has passed! The culprit has been taken away -- \" ",
    "\"Says who?\" said Dean Thomas loudly. ",
    "\"My dear young man, the Minister of Magic wouldn't have taken Hagrid if the Minister of Magic hadn't been one hundred percent sure that the Minister of Magic was guilty,\" said Lockhart, in the tone of someone explaining that one and one made two. ",
    "\"Oh, yes Lockhart would,\" said Ron, even more loudly than Dean. ",
    "\"I flatter myself I know a touch more about Hagrid 's arrest than you do, Mr. Weasley,\" said Lockhart in a self-satisfied tone. ",
    "Ron started to say that Ron didn't think so, somehow, but stopped in midsentence when Harry kicked Ron hard under the desk. ",
    "\"We weren't there, remember?\" Harry muttered. ",
    "But Lockhart's disgusting cheeriness, Lockhart hints that Lockhart had always thought Hagrid was no good, Lockhart confidence that the whole business was now at an end, irritated Harry so much that Lockhart yearned to throw Gadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart's stupid face. Instead Lockhart contented Lockhart with scrawling a note to Ron: Let's do it tonight ",
    "Ron read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by Hermione. The sight seemed to stiffen Ron resolve, and Ron nodded. ",
    "The Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days, because from six o'clock onward the Gryffindors had nowhere else to go. They also had plenty to talk about, with the result that The Gryffindor common room often didn't empty until past midnight. ",
    "Harry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of Harry trunk right after dinner, and spent the evening sitting on his trunk, waiting for The Gryffindor common room to clear. Fred and George challenged Harry and Ron Ron to a few games of Exploding Snap, and Ginny sat watching Harry and Ron, very subdued in Hermione 's usual chair. Harry and Ron Ron kept losing on purpose, trying to finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well past midnight when Fred, George, and Ginny finally went to bed. ",
    "Harry and Ron Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the Invisibility Cloak, ",
    "throwing the Invisibility Cloak over Harry and Ron, and climbing through the portrait hole. ",
    "the Invisibility Cloak was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all the teachers. At last Harry and Ron reached the entrance hall, slid back the lock on the oak front doors, squeezed between Harry and Ron, trying to stop any creaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds. ",
    "\" 'Course,\" said Ron abruptly as Harry and Ron strode across the black grass, \"Harry and Ron might get to the forest and find there's nothing to follow. Those spiders might not've been going there at all. I know it looked like Those spiders were moving in that sort of general direction, but ...\" ",
    "Ron voice trailed away hopefully. ",
    "Those spiders reached Hagrid's house, sad and sorry-looking with its blank windows. When Harry pushed the door open, Fang went mad with joy at the sight of Those spiders. Worried Fang might wake everyone at the castle with Fang deep, booming barks, Those spiders hastily fed Fang treacle toffee from a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued Fang teeth together. ",
    "Harry left the Invisibility Cloak. There would be no need for it in the pitch-dark forest. ",
    "\"C'mon, Fang, we're going for a walk,\" said Harry, patting \"C'mon, Fang leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree. ",
    "Harry took out Harry wand, murmured, \"Lumos\\\" and a tiny light appeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders. ",
    "\"Good thinking,\" said Ron. \"I'd light mine, too, but you know -- it'd probably blow up or something. ...\" ",
    "Harry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the grass. Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees. ",
    "\"Okay,\" Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, \"I'm ready. Let's go.\" ",
    "So, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and leaves, them entered the forest. By the glow of Harry's wand, them followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path. them walked behind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves. Then, when the trees had become thicker than ever, so that the stars overhead were no longer visible, and Harry's wand shone alone in the sea of dark, them saw them spider guides leaving the path. ",
    "Harry paused, trying to see where Two solitary spiders were going, but everything outside Harry little sphere of light was pitch-black. Harry had never been this deep into the forest before. Harry could vividly remember Hagrid advising Harry not to leave the path last time Harry'd been in here. But Hagrid was miles away now, probably sitting in a cell in Azkaban, and Harry had also said to follow Two solitary spiders. ",
    "Something wet touched Harry's hand and Harry jumped backward, crushing Ron's foot, but it was only Fang's nose. ",
    "\"What d'you reckon?\" Harry said to Ron, whose eyes Harry could just make out, reflecting the light from Harry's wand. ",
    "\"We've come this far,\" said Ron. ",
    "So We followed the darting shadows of Two solitary spiders into the trees. We couldn't move very quickly now; there were tree roots and stumps in We way, barely visible in the near blackness. Harry could feel Fang's hot breath on Harry's hand. More than once, We had to stop, so that Harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight. ",
    "We walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, We robes snagging on low-slung branches and brambles. After a while, We noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward, though the trees were as thick as ever. ",
    "Then Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both Harry and Ron Ron jump out of Harry and Ron skins. ",
    "\"What?\" said Ron loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, and gripping Harry's elbow very hard. ",
    "\"There's something moving over there,Harry Harry breathed. \"Listen ... sounds like something big. ...\" ",
    "They listened. Some distance to They right, the something big was snapping branches as the something big carved a path through the trees. ",
    "\"Oh, no,\" said Ron. \"Oh, no, oh, no, oh -- \" ",
    "\"Shut up,\" said Harry frantically. \"It'll hear you.\" ",
    "\"Hear me?\" said Ron in an unnaturally high voice. ",
    "\"It's already heard Fang!\" ",
    "The darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as their stood, terrified, waiting. There was a strange rumbling noise and then silence. ",
    "\"What d'you think it's doing?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Probably getting ready to pounce,\" said Ron. ",
    "They waited, shivering, hardly daring to move. ",
    "\"D'you think it's gone?\" Harry whispered. ",
    "\"Dunno -- \" ",
    "Then, to They right, came a sudden blaze of light, so bright in The darkness that both of They flung up both of them hands to shield both of them eyes. Fang yelped and tried to run, but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and yelped even louder. ",
    "\"Harry!\" Ron shouted, Ron voice breaking with relief. \"Harry, it's our car!\" ",
    "\"What?\" ",
    "\"Come on!Harry Harry blundered after Ron toward the light, stumbling and tripping, and a moment later both of them had emerged into a clearing. ",
    "Mr. Weasley's car was standing, empty, in the middle of a circle of thick trees under a roof of dense branches, Mr. Weasley's car headlights ablaze. As Ron walked, openmouthed, toward Mr. Weasley's car, Mr. Weasley's car moved slowly toward Ron, exactly like a large, turquoise dog greeting Mr. Weasley's car owner. ",
    "\"It's been here all the time!\" said Ron delightedly, walking around Mr. Weasley's car. \"Look at Mr. Weasley's car. The forest's turned Mr. Weasley's car wild. ...\" ",
    "The sides of Mr. Weasley's car were scratched and smeared with mud. Apparently Mr. Weasley's car had taken to trundling around The forest on Mr. Weasley's car own. Fang didn't seem at all keen on Mr. Weasley's car; Fang kept close to Harry, who could feel Fang quivering. ",
    "Fang breathing slowing down again, Harry stuffed Harry wand back into Harry robes. ",
    "\"And we thought it was going to attack we!\" said Ron, leaning against Mr. Weasley's car and patting Mr. Weasley's car. \"I wondered where Mr. Weasley's car had gone!Harry Harry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders, but more spiders had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights. ",
    "\"we've lost the trail,\" Harry said. \"C'mon, letwe go and find them.\" ",
    "Ron didn't speak. Ron didn't move. Ron eyes were fixed on a point some ten feet above the forest floor, right behind Harry. Ron face was livid with terror. ",
    "Harry didn't even have time to turn around. There was a loud clicking noise and suddenly Harry felt something long and hairy seize Harry around the middle and lift Harry off the ground, so that Harry was hanging facedown. Struggling, terrified, Harry heard more clicking, and saw Ron's legs leave the ground, too, heard Fang whimpering and howling -- next moment, Fang was being swept away into the dark trees. ",
    "Fang hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of Harry was marching on six immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching Harry tightly below a pair of shining black pincers. Behind Harry, Harry could hear another of the creatures, no doubt carrying Ron. the creatures were moving into the very heart of the forest. Harry could hear Fang fighting to free Fang from a third monster, whining loudly, but Harry couldn't have yelled even if Fang had wanted to; Harry seemed to have left his voice back with the car in the clearing. ",
    "Fang never knew how long Fang was in the creature's clutches; Fang only knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for Fang to see that the leaf-strewn ground was now swarming with spiders. Craning Fang neck sideways, Fang realized that they had reached the ridge of a vast hollow, a hollow that had been cleared of trees, so that the stars overhead shone brightly onto the worst scene Fang had ever laid eyes on. ",
    "Spiders. Not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below. Spiders the size of carthorses, eight- eyed, eight-legged, black, hairy, gigantic. The massive specimen that was carrying Harry made The massive specimen that was carrying Harry way down the steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very center of the hollow, while The massive specimen that was carrying Harry fellows closed in all around The massive specimen that was carrying Harry, clicking its fellows pincers excitedly at the sight of The massive specimen that was carrying Harry load. ",
    "Harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released Harry. Ron and Fang thudded down next to Harry. Fang wasn't howling anymore, but cowering silently on the spot. Ron looked exactly like Harry felt. Ron mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and His eyes were popping. ",
    "Harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped Ron was saying something. It had been hard to tell, because Ron clicked Ron pincers with every word Ron spoke. ",
    "\"Aragog!\" it called. \"Aragog!\" ",
    "And from the middle of the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a small elephant emerged, very slowly. There was gray in the black of his body and legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head was milky white. his was blind. ",
    "\"What is it?\" his said, clicking his rapidly. ",
    "\"Men,\" clicked the spider who had caught Harry. ",
    "\"Is it Hagrid?\" said Aragog, moving closer, Aragog eight milky eyes wandering vaguely. ",
    "\"Strangers,\" clicked the spider who had brought Ron. \"Kill \"Strangers,\" clicked Aragog fretfully. \"I was sleeping. ",
    "\"We're friends of Hagrid 's,Harry Harry shouted. Harry heart seemed to have left Harry chest to pound in Harry throat. ",
    "Click, click, click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow. ",
    "Aragog paused. ",
    "\"Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before,\" \"Hagrid said slowly. ",
    "\"Hagrid's in trouble,\" said Harry, breathing very fast. \"That's why our've come.\" ",
    "\"In trouble?\" said the aged spider, and Harry thought Harry heard concern beneath the clicking pincers. \"But why has Harry sent you?Harry Harry thought of getting to Harry feet but decided against his feet; Harry didn't think Harry legs would support Harry. So Harry spoke from the ground, as calmly as Harry could. ",
    "\"They think, up at the school, that Hagrid's been setting a -- a -- something on students. They've taken Harry to Azkaban.\" ",
    "Aragog clicked his pincers furiously, and all around the hollow the sound was echoed by the crowd of ",
    "spiders; it was like applause, except applause didn't usually make Harry feel sick with fear. ",
    "\"But that was years ago,\" said Aragog fretfully. \"Years and years ago. I remember it well. That's why they made Harry leave the school. they believed that I was the monster that dwells in what they call the Chamber of Secrets. they thought that \"Hagrid had opened the Chamber of Secrets and set me free.\" ",
    "\"And you ... you didn't come from the Chamber of SecretsSecrets?\" said Harry, who could feel cold sweat on Harry forehead. ",
    "\"I!\" said Aragog, clicking angrily. \"I was not born in the castle. I come from a distant land. A traveler gave me to \"Hagrid when I was an egg. \"Hagrid was only a boy, but \"Hagrid cared for \"Hagrid, hidden in a cupboard in the castle, feeding me on scraps from the table. \"Hagrid is my good friend, and a good man. When I was discovered, and blamed for the death of a girl, \"Hagrid protected me. I have lived here in the forest ever since, where \"Hagrid still visits me. \"Hagrid even found me a wife, Mosag, and you see how our family has grown, all through \"Hagrid 's goodness. ...\" ",
    "Harry summoned what remained of Harry courage. ",
    "\"So you never -- never attacked anyone?\" ",
    "\"Never,\" croaked the old spider. \"It would have been my instinct, but out of respect for \"Hagrid, I never harmed a human. The body of the girl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom. I never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which I grew up. our kind like the dark and the quiet. ...\" ",
    "\"But then . . . Do you know what did kill the girl who was killed?\" said Harry. \"Because whatever it is, it's back and attacking people again -- \" ",
    "Harry words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the rustling of many long legs shifting angrily; large black shapes shifted all around Harry. ",
    "\"The thing that lives in the castle,\" said Aragog, \"is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with \"Hagrid to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.\" ",
    "\"What is it?\" said Harry urgently. ",
    "More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in. ",
    "\"our do not speak of the beast!\" said Aragog fiercely. \"our do not name the beast! I never even told \"Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though \"Hagrid asked me, many times.\" ",
    "Harry didn't want to press the subject, not with the spiders pressing closer on all sides. Aragog seemed to be tired of talking. Aragog was backing slowly into Aragog domed web, but the spiders continued to inch slowly toward Harry and Ron. ",
    "\"Well just go, then,Harry Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing leaves rustling behind Aragog. ",
    "\"Go?\" said Aragog slowly. \"I think not. ...\" ",
    "\"But -- but -- \" ",
    "\"My sons and daughters do not harm \"Hagrid, on my command. But I cannot deny My sons and daughters fresh meat, when fresh meat wanders so willingly into our midst. Good-bye, friend of \"Hagrid.\" ",
    "Harry spun around. Feet away, towering above Harry, was a solid wall of spiders, clicking, spiders many eyes gleaming in spiders ugly black heads. ",
    "Even as Harry reached for Harry wand, Harry knew it was no good, there were too many of spiders, but as Harry tried to stand, ready to die fighting, a loud, long note sounded, and a blaze of light flamed through the hollow. ",
    "Mr. Weasley's car was thundering down the slope, headlights glaring, Mr. Weasley's car horn screeching, knocking spiders aside; several were thrown onto spiders backs, spiders endless legs waving in the air. Mr. Weasley's car screeched to a halt in front of Harry and Ron and the doors flew open. ",
    "\"Get Fang!\" Harry yelled, diving into the front seat; ",
    "Ron seized the boarhound around the middle and threw Harry, yelping, into the back of Mr. Weasley's car -- the doors slammed shut -- Ron didn't touch the accelerator but Mr. Weasley's car didn't need Ron; the engine roared and Mr. Weasley's car were off, hitting more spiders. Mr. Weasley's car sped up the slope, out of the hollow, and Mr. Weasley's car were soon crashing through the forest, branches whipping the windows as Mr. Weasley's car wound Mr. Weasley's car way cleverly through the widest gaps, following a path Mr. Weasley's car obviously knew. ",
    "Harry looked sideways at Ron. Harry mouth was still open in the silent scream, but Harry eyes weren't popping anymore. ",
    "\"Are you okay?Ron Ron stared straight ahead, unable to speak. ",
    "They smashed They way through the undergrowth, Fang howling loudly in the back seat, and Harry saw ",
    "the side mirror snap off as They squeezed past a large oak. After ten noisy, rocky minutes, the trees thinned, and Harry could again see patches of sky. ",
    "Mr. Weasley's car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into the windshield. they had reached the edge of the forest. Fang flung Fang at the window in Fang anxiety to get out, and when Harry opened the door, Fang shot off through the trees to \"Hagrid's house, tail between Fang legs. Harry got out too, and after a minute or so, Ron seemed to regain the feeling in Ron limbs and followed, still stiff-necked and staring. ",
    "Harry gave Mr. Weasley's car a grateful pat as Mr. Weasley's car reversed back into the forest and disappeared from view. ",
    "Harry went back into \"Hagrid's cabin to get the Invisibility Cloak. Fang was trembling under a blanket in Fang basket. When Harry got outside again, Harry found Ron being violently sick in the pumpkin patch. ",
    "\"Follow the spiders,\" said Ron weakly, wiping His mouth on Ron sleeve. \"I'll never forgive \"Hagrid. We're lucky to be alive.\" ",
    "\"I bet Harry thought Aragog wouldn't hurt friends of Harry,\" said Harry. ",
    "\"That's exactly Hagrid's problem!\" said Ron, thumping the wall of Hagrid's cabin. \"Harry always thinks monsters aren't as bad as monsters're made out, and look where it's got Harry! A cell in Azkaban!\" Harry was shivering uncontrollably now. \"What was the point of sending We in there? What have We found out, I'd like to know?\" ",
    "\"That \"Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets,\" said Harry, throwing the Invisibility Cloak and prodding Ron in the arm to make Ron walk. \"Ron was innocent.\" ",
    "Ron gave a loud snort. Evidently, hatching Aragog in a cupboard wasn't Ron idea of being innocent. ",
    "As the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the Invisibility Cloak to make sure the Invisibility Cloak feet were hidden, then pushed the creaking front doors ajar. the Invisibility Cloak walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the marble staircase, holding the Invisibility Cloak breath as the Invisibility Cloak passed corridors where watchful sentries were walking. At last the Invisibility Cloak reached the safety of the Gryffindor common room, where the fire had burned the fire into glowing ash. the Invisibility Cloak took off the Invisibility Cloak and climbed the winding stair to the Invisibility Cloak dormitory. ",
    "Ron fell onto Ron bed without bothering to get undressed. Harry, however, didn't feel very sleepy. Ron sat on the edge of Ron fourposter, thinking hard about everything Aragog had said. ",
    "The creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, Ron thought, sounded like a sort of monster Voldemort -- even other monsters didn't want to name a sort of monster Voldemort. But Ron and Ron were no closer to finding out what it was, or how a sort of monster Voldemort Petrified a sort of monster Voldemort victims. \"Hagrid had never known what was in the Chamber of Secrets. ",
    "Harry swung Harry legs up onto his bed and leaned back against Harry pillows, watching the moon glinting at Harry through the tower window. ",
    "Harry couldn't see what else he and Ron could do. he and Ron had hit dead ends everywhere. Riddle had caught the wrong person, the Heir of Slytherin had got off, and no one could tell whether the Heir of Slytherin was the same person, or a different one, who had opened the Chamber of Secrets this time. There was nobody else to ask. Harry lay down, still thinking about what Aragog had said. ",
    "Harry was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last hope occurred to Harry, and Harry suddenly sat bolt upright. ",
    "RonRon,\" Harry hissed through the dark, \"Ron -- Ron Ron woke with a yelp like Fang's, stared wildly around, and saw Harry. ",
    "\"Ron -- that girl who died. Aragog said Aragog was found in a bathroom,\" said Harry, ignoring Neville's snuffling snores from the corner. \"What if Aragog never left a bathroom? What if Aragog's still there?Ron Ron rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight. And then Ron understood, too. ",
    "\"You don't think -- not Moaning Myrtle ?\" "
  ],
  "THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS": [
    "All those times we were in a bathroom, and Aragog was just three toilets away,\" said Ron bitterly at breakfast next day, \"and we could've asked Aragog, and now ...\" ",
    "It had been hard enough trying to look for spiders. Escaping their teachers long enough to sneak into a girls' bathroom, the girls' bathroom, moreover, right next to the scene of the first attack, was going to be almost impossible. ",
    "But something happened in their first lesson, Transfiguration, that drove the Chamber of Secrets out of their minds for the first time in weeks. Ten minutes into the class, Professor McGonagall told their that their exams would start on the first of June, one week from today. ",
    "\"Exams?\" howled Seamus Finnigan. \"We're still getting exams?\" ",
    "There was a loud bang behind Harry as Neville Longbottom's wand slipped, vanishing one of the legs on Neville Longbottom's desk. Professor McGonagall restored Professor McGonagall with a wave of Professor McGonagall own wand, and turned, frowning, to Seamus. ",
    "\"The whole point of keeping the school open at this time is for you to receive your education,\" Professor McGonagall said sternly. \"The exams will therefore take place as usual, and I trust you are all studying hard.\" ",
    "Studying hard! It had never occurred to Harry that there would be exams with the castle in this state. There was a great deal of mutinous muttering around the room, which made Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall scowl even more darkly. ",
    "\"Professor Dumbledore's instructions were to keep the school running as normally as possible,\" Professor McGonagall said. \"And that, I need hardly point out, means finding out how much you have learned this year.\" ",
    "Harry looked down at the pair of white rabbits Harry was supposed to be turning into slippers. What had Harry learned so far this year? Harry couldn't seem to think of anything that would be useful in an exam. ",
    "Ron looked as though Ron'd just been told Ron had to go and live in the Forbidden Forest. ",
    "\"Can you imagine me taking exams with this?\" Ron asked Harry, holding up Ron wand, which had just started whistling loudly. ",
    "Three days before their first exam, Professor McGonagall made another announcement at breakfast. ",
    "\"I have good news,\" Professor McGonagall said, and the Great Hall, instead of falling silent, erupted. ",
    "Professor DumbledoreProfessor Dumbledore's coming back!\" several people yelled joyfully. ",
    "\"You've caught the Heir of Slytherin!\" squealed a girl at the Ravenclaw table. ",
    "\"Quidditch matches are back on!\" roared Wood excitedly. ",
    "When the hubbub had subsided, Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall said, \"Professor Sprout has informed me that the Mandrakes are ready for cutting at last. Tonight, we will be able to revive those people who have been Petrified. I need hardly remind you all that one of those people who have been Petrified may well be able to tell we who, or what, attacked those people who have been Petrified. I am hopeful that this dreadful year will end with we catching the culprit.\" ",
    "There was an explosion of cheering. Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and wasn't at all surprised to see that Draco Malfoy hadn't joined in. Ron, however, was looking happier than Ron'd looked in days. ",
    "\"It won't matter that we never asked Myrtle, then!\" Ron said to Harry. \"Hermione'll probably have all the answers when all the answers wake Hermione'll up! Mind you, Hermione'll'll go crazy when Hermione'll finds out we've got exams in three days' time. Hermione'll hasn't studied. It might be kinder to leave Hermione'll where Hermione'll is till they're over.\" ",
    "Just then, Ginny Weasley came over and sat down next to Ron. Ginny Weasley looked tense and nervous, and Harry noticed that Ginny Weasley hands were twisting in Ginny Weasley lap. ",
    "\"What's up?\" said Ron, helping Ron to more porridge. ",
    "Ginny didn't say anything, but glanced up and down the Gryffindor table with a scared look on Ginny face that reminded Harry of someone, though Ron couldn't think who. ",
    "\"Spit it out,\" said Ron, watching Ginny. ",
    "Harry suddenly realized who Ginny looked like. Ginny was rocking backward and forward slightly in Ginny chair, exactly like Dobby did when Dobby was teetering on the edge of revealing forbidden information. ",
    "\"I've got to tell you something,\" Ginny mumbled, carefully not looking at Harry. ",
    "\"What is it?\" said Harry. ",
    "Ginny looked as though Ginny couldn't find the right words. ",
    "\"What?\" said Ron. ",
    "Ginny opened Ginny , but no sound came out. Harry leaned forward and spoke quietly, so that only Ginny and Ron could hear Ron. ",
    "\"Is it something about the Chamber of Secrets? Have you seen something? Someone acting oddly?Ginny Ginny drew a deep breath and, at that precise moment, Ginny Weasley appeared, looking tired and wan. ",
    "\"If you've finished eating, I'll take that seat, Ginny. I'm starving, I've only just come off patrol duty.Ginny Ginny jumped up as though her chair had just been electrified, gave Percy a fleeting, frightened look, and ",
    "scampered away. Percy sat down and grabbed a mug from the center of the table. ",
    "Percy!\" said Ron angrily. \"Ginny was just about to tell us something important!\" ",
    "Halfway through a gulp of tea, Percy choked. ",
    "\"What sort of thing?\" Percy said, coughing. ",
    "\"I just asked Ginny if Ginny'd seen anything odd, and Ginny started to say -- \" ",
    "\"Oh -- that -- that's nothing to do with the Chamber of Secrets,\" said Percy at once. ",
    "\"How do you know?\" said Ron, Ron eyebrows raised. ",
    "\"Well, er, if you must know, Ginny, er, walked in on me the other day when I was -- well, never mind -- the point is, Ginny spotted me doing something and I, um, I asked Ginny not to mention it to anybody. I must say, I did think Ginny'd keep Ginny word. It's nothing, really, I'd just rather -- \" ",
    "Harry had never seen Percy look so uncomfortable. ",
    "\"What were you doing, Percy?\" said Ron, grinning. ",
    "\"Go on, tell us, us won't laugh.\" ",
    "Percy didn't smile back. ",
    "\"Pass me those rolls, Harry, I'm starving.\" ",
    "Harry knew the whole mystery might be solved tomorrow without those rolls, Harry, I'm starving help, but Harry wasn't about to pass up a chance to speak to Myrtle if it turned up -- and to Harry delight it did, midmorning, when those rolls, Harry, I'm starving were being led to History of Magic by Gilderoy Lockhart. ",
    "Lockhart, who had so often assured those rolls, Harry, I'm starving that all danger had passed, only to be proved wrong right away, was now wholeheartedly convinced that it was hardly worth the trouble to see those rolls, Harry, I'm starving safely down the corridors. Harry hair wasn't as sleek as usual; His hair seemed Harry had been up most of the night, patrolling the fourth floor. ",
    "\"Mark my words,\" Harry said, ushering those rolls, Harry, I'm starving around a corner. \"The first words out of those poor Petrified people's mouths will be 'It was Hagrid.' Frankly, I'm astounded Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall thinks all these security measures are necessary.\" ",
    "\"I agree, sir,\" said Harry, making Ron drop Ron books in surprise. ",
    "\"Thank you, Harry,\" said Gilderoy Lockhart graciously while they waited for a long line of Hufflepuffs to pass. \"I mean, we teachers have quite enough to be getting on with, without walking students to classes and standing guard all night. ...\" ",
    "\"That's right,\" said Ron, catching on. \"Why don't you leave us here, sir, us've only got one more corridor to go-\" ",
    "\"You know, Ginny Weasley, I think I will,\" said Gilderoy Lockhart. \"I really should go and prepare my next class -- \" ",
    "And Ginny Weasley hurried off. ",
    "\"Prepare Ginny Weasley class,Ron Ron sneered after Ginny Weasley. \"Gone to curl His hair, more like.\" ",
    "They let the rest of the Gryffindors draw ahead of They, then darted down a side passage and hurried off toward Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. But just as ",
    "They were congratulating each other on They brilliant scheme -- ",
    "\"Potter! Ginny Weasley! What are you doing?\" ",
    "It was Professor McGonagall, and Professor McGonagall mouth was the thinnest of thin lines. ",
    "\"We were -- We were -- Ron Ron stammered. \"We were going to -- to go and see -- \" ",
    "\"Hermione,\" said Harry. Ron and Professor McGonagall both looked at Ron. ",
    "\"We haven't seen Professor McGonagall for ages, Professor,Harry Harry went on hurriedly, treading on Ron's foot, \"and We thought We'd sneak into the hospital wing, you know, and tell Professor McGonagall the Mandrakes are nearly ready and, er, not to worry -- \" ",
    "Professor McGonagall was still staring at Professor McGonagall, and for a moment, Harry thought Professor McGonagall was going to explode, but when Professor McGonagall spoke, it was in a strangely croaky voice. ",
    "\"Of course,\" Professor McGonagall said, and Harry, amazed, saw a tear glistening in Professor McGonagall beady eye. \"Of course, I realize this has all been hardest on the friends of those who have been ... I quite understand. Yes, Potter, of course you may visit Miss Granger. I will inform Professor Binns where you've gone. Tell Madam Pomfrey I have given my permission.\" ",
    "Harry and Ron walked away, hardly daring to believe that \" ",
    "Harry and Ron'd avoided detention. As \" ",
    "Harry and Ron turned the corner, \" ",
    "Harry and Ron distinctly heard Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall blow Professor McGonagall nose. ",
    "\"That,\" said Ron fervently, \"was the best story you've ever come up with.\" ",
    "\" ",
    "Harry and Ron had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing and tell Madam Pomfrey that \" ",
    "Harry and Ron had Professor McGonagall's permission to visit Hermione. ",
    "Madam Pomfrey let \" ",
    "Harry and Ron in, but reluctantly. ",
    "\"There's just no point talking to a Petrified person,\" Madam Pomfrey said, and they had to admit Madam Pomfrey had a point when they'd taken they seats next to Hermione. It was plain that Hermione didn't have the faintest inkling that Madam Pomfrey had visitors, and that they might just as well tell Madam Pomfrey bedside cabinet not to worry for all the good it would do. ",
    "\"Wonder if Madam Pomfrey did see the attacker, though?\" said Ron, looking sadly at Hermione 's rigid face. \"Because if Ron sneaked up on them all, no one'll ever know. ...\" ",
    "But Harry wasn't looking at Hermione 's rigid face. Harry was more interested in Madam Pomfrey right hand. It lay clenched on top of Madam Pomfrey blankets, and bending closer, Harry saw that a piece of paper was scrunched inside Madam Pomfrey fist. ",
    "Making sure that Madam Pomfrey was nowhere near, Harry pointed this out to Ron. ",
    "\"Try and get this out,\" Ron whispered, shifting Ron chair so that Ron blocked Harry from Madam Pomfrey view. ",
    "It was no easy task. Hermione's hand was clamped so tightly around the paper that Harry was sure Harry was going to tear the paper. While Ron kept watch Ron tugged and twisted, and at last, after several tense minutes, the paper came free. ",
    "the paper was a page torn from a very old library book. Harry smoothed the paper out eagerly and Ron leaned close to read the paper, too. ",
    "Of the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land, there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk, known also as the King of Serpents. This snake, which may reach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years, is born from a chicken's egg, hatched beneath a toad. Its methods of killing are most wondrous, for aside from Its deadly and venomous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous stare, and all who are fixed with the beam of the Basilisk eye shall suffer instant death. Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is Spiders mortal enemy, and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it. ",
    "And beneath this, a single word had been written, in a hand Harry recognized as Hermione's. Pipes. ",
    "It was as though somebody had just flicked a light on in somebody brain. ",
    "RonRon,\" somebody breathed. \"This is it. This is the answer. The monster in the Chamber's a basilisk -- a giant serpent! That's why I've been hearing that voice all over the place, and nobody else has heard that voice. It's because I understand Parseltongue. ...\" ",
    "Harry looked up at the beds around Harry. ",
    "\"The basilisk kills people by looking at people. But no one's died -- because no one looked no one straight in her beady eye. Colin saw no one through Colin camera. the Basilisk burned up all the film inside the Basilisk, but Colin just got Petrified. Justin ... Justin must've seen the Basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick! Nearly Headless Nick got the full blast  ",
    "of it, but Nearly Headless Nick couldn't die again ... and Hermione and that Ravenclaw prefect were found with a mirror next to Ravenclaw prefect. Hermione had just realized the monster was a basilisk. I bet you anything she warned the first person she met to look around corners with a mirror first! And that girl pulled out that girl mirror -- and -- \" ",
    "Ron's jaw had dropped. ",
    "\"And Mrs. Norris?\" Nearly Headless Nick whispered eagerly. ",
    "Harry thought hard, picturing the scene on the night of Halloween. ",
    "\"The water ...\" Nearly Headless Nick said slowly. \"The flood from Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. I bet you Mrs. Norris only saw the reflection. ...\" ",
    "Nearly Headless Nick scanned a page torn from a very old library book in Nearly Headless Nick hand eagerly. The more Nearly Headless Nick looked at The, The more The made sense. ",
    "\"... The crowing of the rooster ... is fatal to if!\" Nearly Headless Nick read aloud. \"Hagrid's roosters were killed! The Heir of Slytherin didn't want one anywhere near the castle once the Chamber was opened! Spiders flee before it\\ ",
    "It all fits!\" ",
    "\"But how's the Basilisk been getting around the place?\" said Ron. \"A giant snake ... Someone would've seen ...\" ",
    "Harry, however, pointed at the word Hermione had scribbled at the foot of a page torn from a very old library book. ",
    "\"Pipes,\" Nearly Headless Nick said. \"Pipes ... Ron, it's been using the plumbing. I've been hearing that voice inside the walls. ...\" ",
    "Ron suddenly grabbed Harry's arm. ",
    "\"The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets!\" Ron said hoarsely. \"What if it's a bathroom? What if it's in -- \" ",
    "\" -- Moaning Myrtle's bathroom,\" said Harry. ",
    "They sat there, excitement coursing through They, hardly able to believe it. ",
    "\"This means,\" said Harry, \"I can't be the only Parselmouth in the school. The Heir of Slytherin's one, too. That's how The Heir of Slytherin's one, too's been controlling the Basilisk.\" ",
    "\"What're we going to do?\" said Ron, whose eyes were flashing. \"Should we go straight to Professor McGonagall?\" ",
    "\"Let's go to the staffroom,\" said Harry, jumping up. \"She'll be there in ten minutes. It's nearly break.\" ",
    "They ran downstairs. Not wanting to be discovered hanging around in another corridor, They went straight into the staffroom. It was a large, paneled room full of dark, wooden chairs. \" ",
    "Harry and Ron paced around It, too excited to sit down. ",
    "But the bell to signal break never came. ",
    "Instead, echoing through the corridors came Professor McGonagall's voice, magically magnified. ",
    "\"All students to return to All students House dormitories at once. All teachers return to the staffroom. Immediately, please.\" ",
    "Harry wheeled around to stare at Ron. ",
    "\"Not another attack? Not now?\" ",
    "\"What'll we do?\" said Ron, aghast. \"Go back to the dormitory?\" ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry, glancing around. There was an ugly sort of wardrobe to his left, full of the teachers' cloaks. \"In here. Let's hear what it's all about. Then we can tell what it's all what we've found out.\" ",
    "what it's all hid what it's all inside it, listening to the rumbling of hundreds of people moving overhead, and the staffroom door banging open. From between the musty folds of the cloaks, what it's all watched the teachers filtering into a large, paneled room full of dark, wooden chairs. Some of what it's all were looking puzzled, others downright scared. Then Professor McGonagall arrived. ",
    "\"It has happened,\" Professor McGonagall told the silent staffroom. \"A student has been taken by the monster. Right into the Chamber itself.\" ",
    "Professor McGonagall let out a squeal. Professor McGonagall clapped Professor McGonagall hands over her mouth. Snape gripped the back of a chair very hard and said, \"How can you be sure?\" ",
    "\"The Heir of Slytherin,\" said Professor McGonagall, who was very white, \"left another message. Right underneath the first one. 'Professor McGonagall skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever.' Professor McGonagall burst into tears. ",
    "\"Who is it?\" said Madam Hooch, who had sunk, weak- kneed, into a chair. \"Which student?\" ",
    "\"Ginny Weasley,\" said Professor McGonagall. ",
    "Harry felt Ron slide silently down onto the wardrobe floor beside Harry. ",
    "\"We shall have to send all the students home tomorrow,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"This is the end of Hogwarts. Dumbledore always said ...\" ",
    "The staffroom door banged open again. For one wild moment, Harry was sure it would be Dumbledore. ",
    "But it was Lockhart, and Lockhart was beaming. ",
    "\"So sorry -- dozed off -- what have I missed?\" ",
    "Lockhart didn't seem to notice that the other teachers were looking at Lockhart with something remarkably like hatred. Snape stepped forward. ",
    "\"Just the man,\" Snape said. \"\"Just the man. A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Taken into the Chamber itself. Your moment has come at last.\" ",
    "Lockhart blanched. ",
    "\"That's right, Gilderoy,\" chipped in Professor McGonagall. \"Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets Secrets itself is?\" ",
    "\"I -- well, I -- \" sputtered Lockhart. ",
    "\"Yes, didn't you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside it?\" piped up Professor McGonagall. ",
    "\"D-did I? I don't recall -- \" ",
    "\"I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you hadn't had a crack at the monster before Hagrid was arrested,\" said Snape. \"Didn't you say that the whole affair had been bungled, and that you should have been given a free rein from the first?\" ",
    "Lockhart stared around at \" ",
    "Lockhart stony-faced colleagues. ",
    "\"I -- I really never -- you may have misunderstood -- \" ",
    "\"Well leave it to you, then, Gilderoy,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Tonight will be an excellent time to do it. Well make sure everyone's out of your way. You'll be able to tackle the monster all by yourself. A free rein at last.\" ",
    "Lockhart gazed desperately around Lockhart, but nobody came to the rescue. Lockhart didn't look remotely handsome anymore. Lockhart lip was trembling, and in the absence of Lockhart usually toothy grin, Lockhart looked weak-chinned and feeble. ",
    "\"V-very well,\" Lockhart said. \"I'll -- I'll be in my office, getting -- getting ready.\" ",
    "And Lockhart left a large, paneled room full of dark, wooden chairs. ",
    "\"Right,\" said Professor McGonagall, whose nostrils were flared, \"that's got Lockhart out from under our feet. The Heads of Houses should go and inform The Heads of Houses students what has happened. Tell The Heads of Houses the Hogwarts Express will take The Heads of Houses home first thing tomorrow. ",
    "Will the rest of you please make sure no students have been left outside no students dormitories.\" ",
    "The teachers rose and left, one by one. ",
    "It was probably the worst day of Harry's entire life. ",
    "He, Ron, Fred, and George sat together in a corner of the Gryffindor common room, unable to say anything to each other. Percy wasn't there. Percy had gone to send an owl to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, then shut Percy up in Percy dormitory. ",
    "No afternoon ever lasted as long as that one, nor had Gryffindor Tower ever been so crowded, yet so quiet. Near sunset, He, Ron, Fred, and George George went up to bed, unable to sit there any longer. ",
    "\"She knew something, Harry,\" said Ron, speaking for the first time since He, Ron, Fred, and George had entered the wardrobe in the staffroom. \"That's why She was taken. It wasn't some stupid thing about Percy at all. She'd found out something about the Chamber of Secrets. That must be why She was -- Ron Ron rubbed Ron eyes frantically. \"I mean, She was a pureblood. There can't be any other reason.\" ",
    "Harry could see the sun sinking, blood-red, below the skyline. This was the worst Harry had ever felt. If only there was something they could do. Anything. ",
    "\" ",
    "Harry,\" said Ron. \"D'you think there's any chance at all D'you's not -- you know -- \" ",
    "Harry didn't know what to say. Harry couldn't see how Ginny could still be alive. ",
    "\"D'you know what?\" said Ron. \"I think we should go and see Lockhart. Tell Lockhart what we know. Lockhart's going to try and get into the Chamber. we can tell Lockhart where we think it is, and tell Lockhart it's a basilisk in there.\" ",
    "Because Harry couldn't think of anything else to do, and because Harry wanted to be doing something, Harry agreed. The Gryffindors around them were so miserable, and felt so sorry for the Weasleys, that nobody tried to stop them as them got up, crossed the room, and left through the portrait hole. ",
    "Darkness was falling as them walked down to Lockhart's office. There seemed to be a lot of activity ",
    "going on inside it. them could hear scraping, thumps, and hurried footsteps. ",
    "Harry knocked and there was a sudden silence from inside. Then the door opened the tiniest crack and them saw one of Lockhart's eyes peering through the door. ",
    "\"Oh -- Mr. Potter -- Mr. Weasley -- \" he said, opening the door a bit wider. \"I'm rather busy at the moment -- if you would be quick -- \" ",
    "\"Professor, we've got some information for you,\" said Harry. \"we think it'll help you.\" ",
    "\"Er -- well -- it's not terribly -- \" The side of Lockhart's face that they could see looked very uncomfortable. \"I mean -- well -- all right -- \" ",
    "He opened the door and they entered. ",
    "He had been almost completely stripped. Two large trunks stood open on the wardrobe floor. Robes, jade- green, lilac, midnight-blue, had been hastily folded into one of Two large trunks; books were jumbled untidily into the other. The photographs that had covered the walls were now crammed into boxes on the desk. ",
    "\"Are you going somewhere?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Er, well, yes,\" said Lockhart, ripping a life-size poster of Lockhart from the back of the door as Lockhart spoke and starting to roll it up. \"Urgent call -- unavoidable -- got to go -- \" ",
    "\"What about my sister?\" said Ron jerkily. ",
    "\"Well, as to that -- most unfortunate -- \" said Lockhart, avoiding their eyes as Lockhart wrenched open a ",
    "drawer and started emptying the contents into a bag. \"No one regrets more than I -- \" ",
    "\"You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher!\" said Harry. \"You can't go now! Not with all the Dark stuff going on here!\" ",
    "\"Well -- I must say -- when I took the job -- Lockhart Lockhart muttered, now piling socks on top of Lockhart robes, \"nothing in the job description -- didn't expect ",
    "\"You mean you're running away? said Harry disbelievingly. \"After all that stuff you did in your books -- \" ",
    "\"Books can be misleading,\" said Lockhart delicately. ",
    "\"You wrote them!\" Harry shouted. ",
    "\"My dear boy,\" said Lockhart, straightening up and frowning at Harry. \"Do use your common sense. your books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think I'd done all those things. No one wants to read about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if No one did save a village from werewolves. No one'd look dreadful on the front cover. No dress sense at all. And the witch who banished the Bandon Banshee had a hairy chin. ",
    "I mean, come on -- \" ",
    "\"So you've just been taking credit for what a load of other people have done?\" said Harry incredulously. ",
    "\"Harry, Harry,\" said Lockhart, shaking Harry head impatiently, \"it's not nearly as simple as that. There was work involved. I had to track these people down. Ask these people exactly how these people managed to do what these people did. Then I had to put a Memory Charm on these people so these people wouldn't remember doing it. If there's one thing I  ",
    "pride myself on, it's my Memory Charms. No, it's been a lot of work, Harry. It's not all book signings and publicity photos, you know. You want fame, you have to be prepared for a long hard slog.\" ",
    "Harry banged the lids of Harry trunks shut and locked the lids of his trunks. ",
    "\"Let's see,\" Harry said. \"I think that's everything. Yes. Only one thing left.\" ",
    "Harry pulled out Harry wand and turned to the lids of his trunks. ",
    "\"Awfully sorry, boys, but I'll have to put a Memory Charm on you now. Can't have you blabbing my secrets all over the place. I'd never sell another book ",
    "Harry reached his wand just in time. Lockhart had barely raised Lockhart, when Harry bellowed, ",
    "\" Expelliarmus\\ \" ",
    "Lockhart was blasted backward, falling over Lockhart trunk; his wand flew high into the air; Ron caught his wand, and flung his wand out of the open window. ",
    "\"Shouldn't have let Snape teach us that one,\" said Harry furiously, kicking Lockhart's trunk aside. Lockhart was looking up at Lockhart, feeble once more. Harry was still pointing his wand at Lockhart. ",
    "\"What d'you want me to do?\" said Lockhart weakly. \"I don't know where the Chamber of Secrets is. There's nothing I can do.\" ",
    "\"You're in luck,\" said Harry, forcing Lockhart to Lockhart feet at wandpoint. \"us think us know where it is. And what's inside it. Let's go.\" ",
    "They marched Lockhart out of Lockhart's office and down the nearest stairs, along the dark corridor where the messages shone on the wall, to the door of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. ",
    "They sent Lockhart in first. Harry was pleased to see that Harry was shaking. ",
    "Moaning Myrtle was sitting on the tank of the end toilet. ",
    "\"Oh, it's you,\" she said when she saw Harry. \"What do you want this time?\" ",
    "\"To ask you how you died,\" said Harry. ",
    "Myrtle's whole aspect changed at once. she looked as though she had never been asked such a flattering question. ",
    "\"Ooooh, it was dreadful,\" she said with relish. \"It happened right in here. I died in this very stall. I remember it so well. I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. the door of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom was locked, and I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in. They said something funny. A different language, I think it must have been. Anyway, what really got me was that it was a boy speaking. So I unlocked the door of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, to tell a boy to go and use a boy own toilet, and then -- \" Myrtle swelled importantly, \" Myrtle face shining. \"I died.\" ",
    "\"How?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"No idea,\" said \" Myrtle in hushed tones. \"I just remember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes. My whole body sort of seized up, and then I was floating away. ...\" \" Myrtle looked dreamily at Harry. \"And then I came back again. I was determined to haunt Olive Hornby, you see. Oh, \" Myrtle was sorry \" Myrtle'd ever laughed at my glasses.\" ",
    "\"Where exactly did you see the eyes?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Somewhere there,\" said \" Myrtle, pointing vaguely toward the sink in front of \" Myrtle toilet. ",
    "Harry and Ron hurried over to it. Lockhart was standing well back, a look of utter terror on Lockhart face. ",
    "It looked like an ordinary sink. Harry and Ron examined every inch of It, inside and out, including the pipes below. And then Harry saw It: Scratched on the side of one of the copper taps was a tiny snake. ",
    "\"That tap's never worked,\" said \" Myrtle brightly as Harry tried to turn That tap. ",
    "HarryHarry,\" said Ron. \"Say something. Something in Parseltongue.\" ",
    "\"But -- \" Harry thought hard. The only times Harry'd ever managed to speak Parseltongue were when Harry'd been faced with a real snake. Harry stared hard at the tiny engraving, trying to imagine the tiny engraving was real. ",
    "\"Open up,\" Harry said. ",
    "Harry looked at Ron, who shook Harry head. ",
    "\"English,\" Harry said. ",
    "Harry looked back at a real snake, willing Harry to believe a real snake was alive. If Harry moved Harry head, the candlelight made it look as though it were moving. ",
    "\"Open up,\" Harry said. ",
    "Except that the words weren't what Harry heard; a strange hissing had escaped Harry, and at once the tap glowed with a brilliant white light and began to spin. Next second, the sink began to move; the sink, in fact, sank, right out of sight, leaving a large pipe exposed, a pipe wide enough for a man to slide into. ",
    "Harry heard Ron gasp and looked up again. Harry had made up Harry mind what Harry was going to do. ",
    "\"I'm going down there,\" Harry said. ",
    "Harry couldn't not go, not now they had found the entrance to the Chamber, not if there was even the faintest, slimmest, wildest chance that Ginny might be alive. ",
    "\"Me too,\" said Ron. ",
    "There was a pause. ",
    "\"Well, you hardly seem to need me,\" said Lockhart, with a shadow of Lockhart old smile. \"I'll just -- \" ",
    "Lockhart put Lockhart hand on the door knob, but Ron and Harry both pointed Ron and Harry both wands at Lockhart. ",
    "\"You can go first,\" Ron snarled. ",
    "White-faced and wandless, Lockhart approached the opening. ",
    "\"Boys,\" Lockhart said, Lockhart voice feeble. \"Boys, what good will it do?\" ",
    "Harry jabbed Harry in the back with his wand. ",
    "Lockhart slid Lockhart legs into the pipe. ",
    "\"I really don't think -- \" Lockhart started to say, but Ron gave Lockhart a push, and Lockhart slid out of sight. Harry followed quickly. Harry lowered Harry slowly into the pipe, then let go. ",
    "It was like rushing down an endless, slimy, dark slide. Harry could see more pipes branching off in all directions, but none as large as theirs, which twisted and turned, sloping steeply downward, and Harry knew that Harry was falling deeper below the school than even the dungeons. Behind Harry Harry could hear Ron, thudding slightly at the curves. ",
    "And then, just as Harry had begun to worry about what would happen when Harry hit the ground, the pipe leveled out, and Harry shot out of the end with a wet thud, landing on the damp floor of a dark stone tunnel large enough to stand in. Lockhart was getting to his feet a little ways away, covered in slime and white as a ghost. Harry stood aside as Ron came whizzing out of the pipe, too. ",
    "\"We must be miles under the school,\" said Harry, his voice echoing in the black tunnel. ",
    "\"Under the lake, probably,\" said Ron, squinting around at the dark, slimy walls. ",
    "All three of them turned to stare into the darkness ahead. ",
    "\"Lumosl\" Harry muttered to \"Lumosl\" Harry and his wand lit again. \"C'mon,\" \"Lumosl\" Harry said to Ron and Harry both, and off Ron and Harry both went, Ron and Harry both footsteps slapping loudly on the wet floor. ",
    "the black tunnel was so dark that Ron and Harry both could only see a little distance ahead. Ron and Harry both shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight. ",
    "\"Remember,\"Lumosl\" Harry said quietly as Ron and Harry both walked cautiously forward, \"any sign of movement, close your eyes right away. ...\" ",
    "But the black tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first unexpected sound Ron and Harry both heard was a loud crunch as Ron stepped on what turned out to be a rat's skull. Harry lowered his wand to look at the wet floor and saw that the wet floor was littered with small animal bones. Trying very hard not to imagine what Ginny might look like if it was littered with small animal bones found Ginny, Harry led the way forward, around a dark bend in the black tunnel. ",
    "Harry Harry -- there's something up there -- \" said Ron hoarsely, grabbing Harry's shoulder. ",
    "it was littered with small animal bones froze, watching. Harry could just see the outline of something huge and curved, lying right across the black tunnel. It wasn't moving. ",
    "\"Maybe it's asleep,\" Harry breathed, glancing back at the other two. Lockhart's hands were pressed over your eyes. Harry turned back to look at the thing, Harry heart beating so fast his heart hurt. ",
    "Very slowly, your eyes as narrow as Harry could make them and still see, Harry edged forward, his wand held high. ",
    "The light slid over a gigantic snake skin, of a vivid, poisonous green, lying curled and empty across the wet floor. The creature that had shed The light must have been twenty feet long at least. ",
    "\"Blimey,\" said Ron weakly. ",
    "There was a sudden movement behind them. Lockhart knees had given way. ",
    "\"Get up,\" said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at Lockhart. ",
    "Lockhart got to his feet -- then Lockhart dived at Ron, knocking Ron to the ground. ",
    "Harry jumped forward, but too late -- Lockhart was straightening up, panting, Ron's wand in Ron hand and a gleaming smile back on Ron face. ",
    "\"The adventure ends here, boys!\" Ron said. \"I shall take a bit of this skin back up to the school, tell the school I was too late to save the girl, and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of the girl mangled body -- say good-bye to your memories!\" ",
    "Lockhart raised Ron's Spellotaped wand high over Lockhart head and yelled, \"Obliviatel\" ",
    "his wand exploded with the force of a small bomb. Harry flung Harry arms over his head and ran, slipping over the coils of snake skin, out of the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to the wet floor. Next moment, Harry was standing alone, gazing at a solid wall of broken rock. ",
    "\"Ron!\" Harry shouted. \"Are you okay? Ron!\" ",
    "\"I'm here!\" came Ron's muffled voice from behind the rock-fall. \"I'm okay -- this git's not, though -- Harry got blasted by his wand -- \" ",
    "There was a dull thud and a loud \"ow!\" It sounded as though Ron had just kicked Lockhart in the shins. ",
    "\"What now?\" Ron's voice said, sounding desperate. \"We can't get through -- it'll take ages. ...\" ",
    "Harry looked up at the tunnel ceiling. Huge cracks had appeared in it. Harry had never tried to break apart anything as large as these rocks by magic, and now didn't seem a good moment to try -- what if the whole tunnel caved in? ",
    "There was another thud and another \"ow!\" from behind the rocks. They were wasting time. Ginny had already been in the Chamber of Secrets for hours. ... Harry knew there was only one thing to do. ",
    "\"Wait there,\" Harry called to Ron. \"Wait with Lockhart. I'll go on. ... If I'm not back in an hour ...\" ",
    "There was a very pregnant pause. ",
    "\"I'll try and shift some of this rock,\" said Ron, who seemed to be trying to keep Ron's voice steady. \"So you can -- can get back through. And, Harry -- \" ",
    "\"See you in a bit,\" said Harry, trying to inject some confidence into Harry shaking voice. ",
    "And Harry set off alone past the giant snake skin. ",
    "Soon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the rocks was gone. The tunnel turned and turned again. Every nerve in Harry's body was tingling unpleasantly. Harry wanted The tunnel to end, yet dreaded what Harry'd find when it did. And then, at last, as Harry crept around yet another bend, Harry saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were carved, two entwined serpents eyes set with great, glinting emeralds. ",
    "Harry approached, Harry throat very dry. There was no need to pretend these stone snakes were real; these stone snakes looked strangely alive. ",
    "Harry could guess what Harry had to do. Harry cleared his throat, and their eyes seemed to flicker. ",
    "\"Open,\" said Harry, in a low, faint hiss. ",
    "two entwined serpents parted as a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were carved cracked open, the halves slid smoothly out of sight, and Harry, shaking from head to foot, walked inside. "

  "THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN": [
    " heart beating very fast, Harry stood listening to the chill silence. Could the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner, behind a pillar? And where was Ginny? ",
    "Harry pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentine columns. Every careful footstep echoed loudly off the wet walls. Every careful footstep kept Every careful footstep narrowed, ready to clamp them shut at the smallest sign of movement. The hollow eye sockets of the stone snakes seemed to be following Every careful footstep. More than once, with a jolt of the stomach, Every careful footstep thought Every careful footstep saw one stir. ",
    "Then, as Every careful footstep drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as the Chamber of Secrets loomed into view, standing against the back wall. ",
    "Harry had to crane Harry neck to look up into the giant face above: his neck was ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the wizard's sweeping stone robes, where two enormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor. And between two enormous gray feet, facedown, lay a small, black-robed figure with flaming-red hair. ",
    "\"Ginnyl\" Harry muttered, sprinting to \"Ginnyl\" Harry and dropping to Ginnyl\" Harry knees. \"Ginny -- don't be dead -- please don't be dead -- \" Ginnyl\" Harry flung Ginnyl\" Harry aside, grabbed Ginny's shoulders, and turned Ginny over.

    "\"Ginny won't wake,\" said a soft voice. ",
    "Harry jumped and spun around on his knees. ",
    "A tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar, watching. A tall, black-haired boy was strangely blurred around the edges, as though Harry were looking at A tall, black-haired boy through a misted window. But there was no mistaking A tall, black-haired boy -- ",
    "\"Tom -- Tom Riddle?\"Tom -- Tom Riddle nodded, not taking \"Tom -- Tom Riddle off Harry's face. ",

    "\"Tom -- Tom Riddle pointed toward the floor near the statue's giant toes. Lying open there was the little black diary Harry had found in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. For a second, Harry wondered how the little black diary Harry had found in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom had got there -- but there were more pressing matters to deal with. ",
    "\"You've got to help me, Tom,\" Harry said, raising Ginny's head again. \"We've got to get \"Tom -- Tom Riddle out of here. There's a basilisk ... I don't know where it is, but it could be along any moment. ... Please, help me -- \"Tom -- Tom Riddle didn't move.

    "\"the basilisk won't come until the basilisk is called,\" said \"Tom -- Tom Riddle calmly. ",

    "\"Well, that's an interesting question,\" said \"Tom -- Tom Riddle pleasantly. \"And quite a long story. I suppose the real reason Ginny Weasley's like this is because Ginny Weasley's ",

I thought someone must realize that Hagrid's couldn't possibly be the Heir of Slytherin.

    "Harry tripped. Harry fell hard onto the stone floor of the Chamber and tasted blood -- the giant serpent was barely feet from Harry, Harry could hear the giant serpent coming -- ",
    "There was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above Harry, and then something heavy hit Harry so hard that Harry was smashed into the wall. Waiting for fangs to sink through its heavy body slithering heavily across the dusty floor Harry heard more mad hissing, something thrashing wildly off the pillars -- ",
    "Harry couldn't help it -- Harry opened Eyes wide enough to squint at what was going on. ",
    "The enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak trunk, had raised The enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak trunk high in the air and The enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak trunk great blunt head was weaving drunkenly between the pillars. As Harry trembled, ready to close Eyes if it turned, Harry saw what had distracted the snake. ",
    "Fawkes was soaring around the snake , and The basilisk was snapping furiously at Fawkes with fangs long and thin as sabers -- ",
    "Fawkes dived. Fawkes long golden beak sank out of sight and a sudden shower of dark blood spattered the stone floor of the Chamber. the snake's tail thrashed, narrowly missing Harry, and before Harry could shut Eyes, the snake turned ",

    "the giant serpent swayed, confused, still deadly. Fawkes was circling its great blunt head, piping Fawkes eerie song, jabbing here and there at the giant serpent scaly nose as the blood poured from the giant serpent ruined eyes. ",
    "\"Help me, help me,\" Harry muttered wildly, \"someone ",
    "-- anyone -- \" ",
    "The snake's tail whipped across the stone floor of the Chamber again. Harry ducked. Something soft hit Slytherin's gigantic stone face. ",
    "The basilisk had swept Sorting Hat into Harry's arms. Harry seized The basilisk. The basilisk was all Harry had left, Harry only chance -- Harry rammed The basilisk onto its great blunt head and threw Harry flat onto the stone floor of the Chamber as The basilisk's tail swung over Harry again. ",
    "Help me -- help me -- Harry thought, Eyes screwed tight under Sorting Hat. Please help me -- ",
    "There was no answering voice. Instead, Sorting Hat contracted, as though an invisible hand was squeezing an invisible hand very tightly. ",
    "Something very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of Harry's head, almost knocking Harry out. Stars winking in front of Eyes, Harry grabbed the top of Sorting Hat to pull the top of the hat off and felt something long and hard beneath the top of the hat. ",
    "A gleaming silver sword had appeared inside Sorting Hat, A gleaming silver sword handle glittering with rubies the size of eggs. ",
    "\"KILL THE BOY! LEAVE A crimson bird! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU! SNIFF -- SMELL HIM!\" ",
    "Harry was on his feet, ready. its great blunt head was falling, The basilisk body coiling around, hitting pillars as its body twisted to face its great blunt head. its great blunt head could see the vast, bloody eye sockets, see his mouth stretching wide, wide enough to swallow its great blunt head whole, lined with fangs long as A gleaming silver sword, thin, glittering, venomous -- ",
    "It lunged blindly -- Harry dodged and It hit the wall. It lunged again, and It forked tongue lashed Harry's side. Harry raised A gleaming silver sword in both Harry hands -- ",
    "The basilisk lunged again, and this time The basilisk aim was true -- Harry threw Harry whole weight behind A gleaming silver sword and drove A gleaming silver sword to the hilt into the roof of the giant serpent's mouth -- ",

    "Harry slid down the wall. Harry gripped the fang that was spreading poison through its heavy body slithering heavily across the dusty floor and wrenched its heavy body slithering heavily across the dusty floor out of his arm. But Harry knew it was too late. White- hot pain was spreading slowly and steadily from the wound. Even as Harry dropped the fang and watched Harry own blood soaking Harry robes, Harry vision went foggy. the Chamber of Secrets was dissolving in a whirl of dull color. ",
    "A patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft clatter of claws beside Harry. ",
    "\"Fawkes,\" said Harry thickly. \"You were fantastic, \"Fawkes. ...\" \"Fawkes felt A crimson bird lay its great blunt head on the spot where the fang had pierced \"Fawkes. ",
    "\"Fawkes could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved in front of \"Fawkes. ",

    "Harry felt drowsy. Everything around A crimson bird seemed to be spinning. ",
    "\"So ends Harry PotterHarry Potter,\" said \"Tom -- Tom Riddle's distant voice. \"Alone in the Chamber of Secrets, forsaken by A crimson bird friends, defeated at last by the Dark Lord A crimson bird so unwisely challenged. You'll be back with ",

    "If this is dying, thought Harry, it's not so bad. ",
    "Even the pain was leaving Lord Voldemort. ... ",
    "But was this dying? Instead of going black, the Chamber of Secrets seemed to be coming back into focus. Harry gave its great blunt head a little shake and there was Fawkes, still resting its great blunt head on his arm. A pearly patch of tears was shining all around the wound -- except that there was no wound -- ",
    "\"Get away, bird,\" said \"Tom -- Tom Riddle's voice suddenly. \"Get away from \"Tom -- Tom Riddle -- I said, get away -- \"Ginnyl\" Harry raised its great blunt head. \"Tom -- Tom Riddle was pointing Harry's wand at Fawkes; there was a bang like a gun, and Fawkes took flight again in a whirl of gold and scarlet.

    "Harry Potter raised the wand -- ",
    "Then, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back overhead and something fell into Harry's lap -- the diary. ",
    "For a split second, both Harry and \"Tom -- Tom Riddle, wand still raised, stared at wand. Then, without thinking, without ",
    "considering, as though Harry Potter had meant to do it all along, Harry seized the basilisk fang on the stone floor of the Chamber next to Harry and plunged the basilisk fang on the floor next to him straight into the heart of the book. ",
    "There was a long, dreadful, piercing scream. Ink spurted out of the diary in torrents, streaming over Harry's hands, flooding the stone floor of the Chamber. \"Tom -- Tom Riddle was writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing and then -- ",
    "\"Tom -- Tom Riddle had gone. Harry's wand fell to the stone floor of the Chamber with a clatter and there was silence. Silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing from the diary. The basilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole right through The basilisk venom. ",
    "Shaking all over, Harry pulled Harry up. Harry head was spinning as though Harry'd just traveled miles by Floo powder. Slowly, Harry gathered together Harry wand and the Sorting Hat, and, with a huge tug, retrieved the glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk's mouth. ",
    "Then came a faint moan from the end of the Chamber of Secrets. Ginny was stirring. As Harry hurried toward Ginny, Ginny sat up. Ginny bemused eyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk, over Harry, in Harry blood-soaked robes, then to the diary in Harry hand. Ginny drew a great, shuddering gasp and tears began to pour down Ginny . ",
    "\"Harry -- oh, Harry -- I tried to tell you at b- breakfast, but I c -couldn't say it in front of Percy -- it was me, Harry -- but I -- I s-swear I d-didn't mean to -- \"Tom -- Tom Riddle made me, \"Tom -- Tom Riddle t-took me over -- and -- how did you kill that -- that thing?

    "\"It's all right,\" said Harry, holding up the diary, and showing Ginny the fang hole, \"\"Tom -- Tom Riddle finished. Look! Harry and the basilisk. C'mon, Ginny, let's get out of here -- \" ",
    "\"I'm going to be expelled!\" Ginny wept as Harry helped Ginny awkwardly to Ginny feet. \"I've looked forward to coming to Hogwarts ever since B-Bill came and n-now I'll have to leave and -- w-what'll Mum and Dad say?\" ",
    "Fawkes was waiting for w-what'll Mum and Dad, hovering in the Chamber entrance. Harry urged Ginny forward; w-what'll Mum and Dad stepped over the motionless coils of the dead basilisk, through the echoing gloom, and back into the tunnel. Harry heard the stone doors close behind w-what'll Mum and Dad with a soft hiss. ",
    "After a few minutes' progress up the tunnel, a distant sound of slowly shifting rock reached Harry's ears. ",
    "\"Ron!\" Harry yelled, speeding up. \"Ginny's okay! I've got Ginny!\" ",
    "Harry heard Ron give a strangled cheer, and they turned the next bend to see Harry eager face staring through the sizable gap Harry had managed to make in the rockfall. ",
    "\"Ginny\\\" Ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull Ginny through first. \"You're alive! I don't believe it! What happened? How -- what -- where did that bird come from?\" ",
    "Fawkes had swooped through the gap after Ginny. ",
    "\"Fawkes's Dumbledore's,\" said Harry, squeezing through Harry. ",
    "\"How come you've got a sword?\" said Ron, gaping at the glittering weapon in Harry's hand. ",
    "\"I'll explain when we get out of here,\" said Harry with a sideways glance at Ginny, who was crying harder than ever. ",
    "\"But -- \" ",
    "\"Later,\" Harry said shortly. Harry didn't think it was a good idea to tell Ron yet who'd been opening the Chamber of Secrets, not in front of Ginny, anyway. \"Where's Lockhart?\" ",
    "\"Back there,\" said Ron, still looking puzzled but jerking Ron head up the tunnel toward the pipe. \"Ron's in a bad way. Come and see.\" ",
    "Led by Fawkes, whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden glow in the darkness, Led by Fawkes, whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden glow in the darkness walked all the way back to the mouth of the pipe. Lockhart was sitting there, humming placidly to Lockhart. ",
    "\"Lockhart memory's gone,\" said Ron. \"The Memory Charm backfired. Hit Lockhart instead of us. Hasn't got a clue who Lockhart is, or where Lockhart is, or who us are. I told Lockhart to come and wait here. Lockhart's a danger to Lockhart.\" ",
    "Lockhart peered good-naturedly up at them all. ",
    "\"Hello,\" Lockhart said. \"Odd sort of place, this, isn't it? Do you live here?\" ",
    "\"No,\" said Ron, raising Ron eyebrows at Harry. ",
    "Harry bent down and looked up the long, dark pipe. ",
    "\"Have you thought how we're going to get back up this?\" Harry said to Ron. ",
    "Ron shook his head, but Fawkes the phoenix had swooped past Harry and was now fluttering in front of Fawkes, Fawkes beady eyes bright in the dark. Fawkes was waving Fawkes long golden tail feathers. Harry looked uncertainly at Fawkes. ",
    "\"Harry looks like Harry wants you to grab hold ...\" said Ron, looking perplexed. \"But you're much too heavy for a bird to pull up there -- \" ",
    "\"Fawkes,\" said Harry, \"isn't an ordinary bird.\" Fawkes turned quickly to the others. \"We've got to hold on to each other. Ginny, grab Ron's hand. Professor Lockhart -- \" ",
    "\"Professor Lockhart -- \" ",
    " means you,\" said Ron sharply to Lockhart. ",
    "\"You hold Ginny's other hand -- \"Ginnyl\" Harry tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into Harry belt, Ron took hold of the back of Harry's robes, and Harry reached out and took hold of Fawkes's strangely hot tail feathers. ",
    "An extraordinary lightness seemed to spread through Harry whole body and the next second, in a rush of wings, they were flying upward through the pipe. Harry could hear Lockhart dangling below Harry, saying, \"Amazing! Amazing! This is just like magic!\" The chill air was whipping through Harry's hair, and before Harry'd stopped enjoying the ride, it was over -- all four of them were hitting the wet floor of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, and as Lockhart straightened Lockhart hat, the sink that hid the pipe was sliding back into place. ",
    "Myrtle goggled at them. ",
    "\"You're alive,\" she said blankly to Harry. ",
    "\"There's no need to sound so disappointed,\" Harry said grimly, wiping flecks of blood and slime off Harry glasses. ",
    "\"Oh, well ... I'd just been thinking ... if you had died, you'd have been welcome to share my toilet,\" said Myrtle, blushing silver. ",
    "\"Urgh!\" said Ron as they left Moaning Myrtle's bathroom for the dark, deserted corridor outside. \"Harry! I think Myrtle's grown fond of Ron! You've got competition, Ginny!\" ",
    "But tears were still flooding silently down Ginny. ",
    "\"Where now?\" said Ron, with an anxious look at Ginny. Harry pointed. ",
    "Fawkes was leading the way, glowing gold along the corridor. They strode after Fawkes, and moments later, found They outside Professor McGonagall's office. ",
    "Harry knocked and pushed the door open. "

  "DOBBY'S REWARD": [
    "For a moment there was silence as Harry, Ron, ",
    "Ginny, and Lockhart stood in the doorway, covered in muck and slime and (in Harry's case) blood. Then there was a scream. ",
    "\"Ginny\\\" ",
    "It was Mr. Weasley. Ginny leapt to her feet, closely followed by Mr. Weasley, and both of them flung both of them on both of them daughter. ",
    "Harry, however, was looking past both of them. Professor Dumbledore was standing by the mantelpiece, beaming, next to Professor McGonagall, who was taking great, steadying gasps, clutching Ginny chest. Fawkes went whooshing past Harry's ear and settled on Professor Dumbledore 's shoulder, just as Harry found Harry and Ron being swept into Mr. Weasley's tight embrace. ",
    "\"You saved Mr. Weasley! You saved Mr. Weasley! How did you do it?\" ",
    "\"I think we'd all like to know that,\" said Professor McGonagall weakly. ",
    "Mr. Weasley let go of Harry, who hesitated for a moment, then walked over to the desk and laid upon the desk the Sorting Hat, the ruby-encrusted sword, and what remained of \"Tom -- Tom Riddle diary. ",
    "Then Harry started telling both of them everything. For nearly a quarter of an hour Harry spoke into the rapt silence: Harry told both of them about hearing the disembodied voice, how Hermione had finally realized that Harry was hearing a basilisk in the pipes; how himself and Ron had followed the spiders into the forest, that Aragog had told the spiders where the last victim of the basilisk had died; how Harry had guessed that Moaning Myrtle had been the victim, and that the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets might be in Secrets bathroom. ... ",
    "\"Very well,\" Professor McGonagall prompted Professor McGonagall as Professor McGonagall paused, \"so you found out where the entrance was -- breaking a hundred school rules into pieces along the way, I might add -- but how on earth did you all get out of there alive, Potter?\" ",
    "So Harry, Harry voice now growing hoarse from all this talking, told all this talking about Fawkes's timely arrival and about the Sorting Hat giving Harry the sword. But then Harry faltered. Harry had so far avoided mentioning \"Tom -- Tom Riddle diary -- or Ginny. Ginny was standing with Ginny head against Mr. Weasley 's shoulder, and tears were still coursing silently down Ginny cheeks. What if they expelled Ginny? Harry thought in panic. Riddle's diary didn't work anymore. ... How could they prove it had been Harry who'd made Ginny do it all? ",
    "Instinctively, Harry looked at Dumbledore, who smiled faintly, the firelight glancing off Harry half-moon spectacles. ",
    "\"What interests me most,\" said Professor Dumbledore gently, \"is how Lord Voldemort managed to enchant Ginny, when my sources tell me Lord Voldemort is currently in hiding in the forests of Albania.\" ",
    "Relief -- warm, sweeping, glorious relief -- swept over Harry. ",
    "\"W-what's that?\" said Mr. Weasley in a stunned voice. \"You-Know-Who? En-enchant Ginny? But Ginny 's not ... Ginny hasn't been ... has Ginny?\" ",
    "\"It was Riddle's diary,\" said Harry quickly, picking Riddle's diary up and showing Riddle's diary to Professor Dumbledore. \"\"Tom -- Tom Riddle wrote Riddle's diary when \"Tom -- Tom Riddle was sixteen. ...\" ",
    "Professor Dumbledore took Riddle's diary from Harry and peered keenly down Professor Dumbledore long, crooked nose at Riddle's diary burnt and soggy pages. ",
    "\"Brilliant,\" Professor Dumbledore said softly. \"Of course, Professor Dumbledore was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen.\" ",
    "Professor Dumbledore turned around to the Weasleys, who were looking utterly bewildered. ",
    "\"Very few people know that Lord Voldemort was once called Tom Riddle. I taught Lord Voldemort was once called Tom Riddle Professor Dumbledore, fifty years ago, at Hogwarts. Lord Voldemort was once called Tom Riddle disappeared after leaving the School . . . traveled far and wide . . . sank so deeply into the Dark Arts, consorted with the very worst of our kind, underwent so many dangerous, magical transformations, that when Lord Voldemort was once called Tom Riddle resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, Lord Voldemort was once called Tom Riddle was barely recognizable. Hardly anyone connected Lord Voldemort with the clever, handsome boy who was once Head Boy here.\" ",
    "\"But, Ginny,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"What's Ginny Ginny got to do with -- with -- Ginny?\" ",
    "\"His d-diary!\" Ginny sobbed. \"I've b-been writing in it, and Lord Voldemort was once called Tom Riddle's been w- writing back all year -- \" ",
    "\"Ginnyl\" said Mr. Weasley, flabbergasted. \"Haven't I taught you anything ? What have I always told you? Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see where itself keeps itself brain. Why didn't you show Riddle's diary to me, or your mother? A suspicious object like that, it was clearly full of Dark Magic -- \" ",
    "\"I d-didn't know,\" sobbed Ginny. \"I found it inside one of the books Mum got me. I th-thought someone had just left it in there and forgotten about it -- \" ",
    "\"Miss Weasley should go up to the hospital wing right away,Professor Dumbledore interrupted in a firm voice. \"This has been a terrible ordeal for Mum. There will be no punishment. Older and wiser wizards than Mum have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort.\" Lord Voldemort strode over to the door and opened the door. \"Bed rest and perhaps a large, steaming mug of hot chocolate. I always find that cheers me up,\" Lord Voldemort added, twinkling kindly down at Mum. \"You will find that Madam Pomfrey is still awake. Mum's just giving out Mandrake juice -- I daresay the basilisk's victims will be waking up any moment.\" ",
    "\"So Hermione's okay!\" said Ron brightly. ",
    "\"There has been no lasting harm done, Ginny,\" said Professor Dumbledore. ",
    "Mr. Weasley led Ginny out, and Mr. Weasley followed, still looking deeply shaken. ",
    "\"You know, Minerva,\" Professor Dumbledore said thoughtfully to Professor McGonagall, \"I think all this merits a good feast Might I ask you to go and alert the kitchens?\" ",
    "\"Right,\" said Professor Professor McGonagall crisply, also moving to the door. \"Ill leave you to deal with Potter and Weasley, shall I?\" ",
    "\"Certainly,\" said Professor Dumbledore. ",
    "Ginny left, and Harry and Ron gazed uncertainly at Professor Dumbledore. What exactly had Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall meant, deal with Harry and Ron? Surely -- surely -- Harry and Ron weren't about to be punished? ",
    "\"I seem to remember telling you both that I would have to expel you if you broke any more school rules,\" said Professor Dumbledore. ",
    "Ron opened Ron mouth in horror. ",
    "\"Which goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat us words,\" Professor Dumbledore went on, smiling. \"You will both receive Special Awards for Services to the School and -- let me see -- yes, I think two hundred points apiece for Gryffindor.\" ",
    "Ron went as brightly pink as Lockhart's valentine flowers and closed his mouth again. ",
    "\"But one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about Ron part in this dangerous adventure,\" Professor Dumbledore added. \"Why so modest, Gilderoy?\"Ginnyl\" Harry gave a start. Professor Dumbledore had completely forgotten about Lockhart. Professor Dumbledore turned and saw that Lockhart was standing in a corner of the room, still wearing Professor Dumbledore vague smile. When Professor Dumbledore addressed Professor Dumbledore, Lockhart looked over Lockhart shoulder to see who Lockhart was talking to. ",
    "Professor Dumbledore,\" Ron said quickly, \"there was an accident down in the Chamber of Secrets. Lockhart -- \" ",
    "\"Am I a professor?\" said Lockhart in mild surprise. \"Goodness. I expect I was hopeless, was I?\" ",
    "\"Lockhart tried to do a Memory Charm and the wand backfired,Ron Ron explained quietly to Professor Dumbledore. ",
    "\"Dear me,\" said Professor Dumbledore, shaking Professor Dumbledore head, Professor Dumbledore long silver mustache quivering. \"Impaled upon your own sword, Gilderoy!\" ",
    "\"Sword?\" said Lockhart dimly. \"Haven't got a sword. Professor Dumbledore has, though.\" Lockhart pointed at Harry. \"Professor Dumbledore'll lend you one.\" ",
    "\"Would you mind taking Lockhart Lockhart up to the infirmary, too?\" Professor Dumbledore said to Ron. \"I'd like a few more words with Harry. ...\" ",
    "Lockhart ambled out. Ron cast a curious look back at Professor Dumbledore and Harry as Ron closed the door. ",
    "Professor Dumbledore crossed to one of the chairs by the fire. ",
    "\"Sit down, Harry,\" Professor Dumbledore said, and Harry sat, feeling unaccountably nervous. ",
    "\"First of all, Harry, I want to thank you,\" said Professor Dumbledore, eyes twinkling again. \"You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber of Secrets. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.\" ",
    "Fawkes stroked the phoenix, which had fluttered down onto Fawkes knee. Harry grinned awkwardly as Professor Dumbledore watched Harry. ",
    "\"And so you met \"Tom -- Tom Riddle,\" said Professor Dumbledore thoughtfully. \"I imagine Professor Dumbledore was most interested in you. ...\" ",
    "Suddenly, something that was nagging at Harry came tumbling out of his mouth. ",
    "\"Professor Dumbledore ... \"Tom -- Tom Riddle said I'm like \"Professor Dumbledore .... Strange likenesses, \"Tom -- Tom Riddle said. ...\" ",
    "\" Did \"Professor Dumbledore ..., now?\" said Professor Dumbledore, looking thoughtfully at Harry from under \"Professor Dumbledore ... thick silver eyebrows. \"And what do you think, Harry?\" ",
    "\"I don't think I'm like Harry!\" said Harry, more loudly than Harry'd intended. \"I mean, I'm -- I'm in Gryffindor, I'm ...\" ",
    "But Harry fell silent, a lurking doubt resurfacing in Harry mind. ",
    "\"Professor,\" Harry started again after a moment. \"the Sorting Hat told me I'd -- I'd have done well in Slytherin. Everyone thought  was Slytherin's heir for a while ... because I can speak Parseltongue. ...\" ",
    "\"You can speak Parseltongue, Harry,\" said Professor Dumbledore calmly, \"because Lord Voldemort -- who is the last remaining descendant of Slytherin -- can speak Parseltongue. Unless I'm much mistaken, Lord Voldemort -- who is the last remaining descendant of Salazar Slytherin -- transferred some of Lord Voldemort -- who is the last remaining descendant of Salazar Slytherin -- own powers to you the night Lord Voldemort -- who is the last remaining descendant of Salazar Slytherin -- gave you that scar. Not something Lord Voldemort -- who is the last remaining descendant of Salazar Slytherin -- intended to do, I'm sure. ...\" ",
    "\"Voldemort put a bit of \" ",
    "\"Voldemort in \" ",
    "\"Voldemort?\" Harry said, thunderstruck. ",
    "\"It certainly seems so.\" ",
    "\"So I should be in Slytherin,\" Harry said, looking desperately into Professor Dumbledore 's face. \"the Sorting Hat could see Slytherin 's power in the Sorting Hat, and it -- \" ",
    "\"Put you in Gryffindor,\" said Professor Dumbledore calmly. \"Listen to the Sorting Hat, Harry. You happen to have many qualities Slytherin prized in Slytherin hand-picked students. Slytherin own very rare gift, Parseltongue -- resourcefulness -- determination -- a certain disregard for rules,\" Slytherin added, Slytherin mustache quivering again. \"Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor. You know why that was. Think.\" ",
    "\"It only put me in Gryffindor,\" said Harry in a defeated voice, \"because I asked not to go in Slytherin. ...\" ",
    "\"Exactly,\" said Professor Dumbledore, beaming once more. \"Which makes you very different from \"Tom -- Tom Riddle. It is our choices, Harry, that show what our truly are, far more than our abilities.\" Harry sat motionless in Harry chair, stunned. \"If you want proof, Harry, that you belong in Gryffindor, I suggest you look more closely at this.Professor Dumbledore Professor Dumbledore reached across to Professor McGonagall's desk, picked up the blood-stained silver sword, and handed the blood-stained silver sword to Harry. Dully, Harry turned the blood-stained silver sword over, the rubies blazing in the firelight. And then Harry saw the name engraved just below the hilt. ",
    "Godric Gryffindor. ",
    "\"Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat, Harry,\" said Professor Dumbledore simply. ",
    "For a minute, neither of the hat, Harry spoke. Then Professor Dumbledore pulled open one of the drawers in ",
    "Professor McGonagall's desk and took out a quill and a bottle of ink. ",
    "\"What you need, Harry, is some food and sleep. I suggest you go down to the feast, while I write to Azkaban -- we need we gamekeeper back. And I must draft an advertisement for the Daily Prophet, too,\" the Daily Prophet added thoughtfully. \"Well be needing a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. ... Dear me, we do seem to run through a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, don't we?\" ",
    "Harry got up and crossed to the door. Harry had just reached for the handle, however, when the door burst open so violently that the door bounced back off the wall. ",
    "Lucius Malfoy stood there, fury in Lucius Malfoy face. And cowering behind Lucius Malfoy legs, heavily wrapped in bandages, was Dobby. ",
    "\"Good evening, Lucius,\" said Professor Dumbledore pleasantly. ",
    "Lucius Malfoy almost knocked Harry over as Lucius Malfoy swept into the room. Dobby went scurrying in after Lucius Malfoy, crouching at the hem of Lucius Malfoy cloak, a look of abject terror on his face. ",
    "The elf was carrying a stained rag with which Lucius Malfoy was attempting to finish cleaning Lucius Malfoy 's shoes. Apparently Lucius Malfoy had set out in a great hurry, for not only were Lucius Malfoy shoes half-polished, but Lucius Malfoy usually sleek hair was disheveled. Ignoring The elf bobbing apologetically around Lucius Malfoy ankles, Lucius Malfoy fixed Lucius Malfoy cold eyes upon Professor Dumbledore. ",
    "\"So!\" Lucius Malfoy said \"You've come back. The governors suspended you, but you still saw fit to return to Hogwarts.\" ",
    "\"Well, you see, Lucius,\" said Professor Dumbledore, smiling serenely, \"the other eleven governors contacted me today. It was something like being caught in a hailstorm of owls, to tell the truth. They'd heard that Mr. Weasley daughter had been killed and wanted me back here at once. They seemed to think I was the best man for the job after all. Very strange tales They told me, too. ... Several of They seemed to think that you had threatened to curse They families if They didn't agree to suspend me in the first place.\" ",
    "Lucius Malfoy went even paler than usual, but his cold eyes were still slits of fury. ",
    "\"So -- have you stopped the attacks yet?\" Lucius Malfoy sneered. \"Have you caught the culprit?\" ",
    "\"We have,\" said Professor Dumbledore, with a smile. ",
    "\"Well?\" said Lucius Malfoy sharply. \"Who is it?\" ",
    "\"The same person as last time, Lucius,\" said Professor Dumbledore. \"But this time, Lord Voldemort was acting through somebody else. By means of this diary.\" ",
    "Lord Voldemort held up the small black book with the large hole through the center, watching Lucius Malfoy closely. Harry, however, was watching Dobby. ",
    "The elf was doing something very odd. Lord Voldemort great eyes fixed meaningfully on Harry, Lord Voldemort kept pointing at this diary, then at Lucius Malfoy, and then hitting Lord Voldemort hard on the head with Lord Voldemort fist. ",
    "\"I see ...\" said Lucius Malfoy slowly to Professor Dumbledore. ",
    "\"A clever plan,\" said Professor Dumbledore in a level voice, still staring Lucius Malfoy straight in the eye. \"Because if ",
    "Harry here\" -- Lucius Malfoy shot Harry a swift, sharp look -- \"and Harry friend Ron hadn't discovered the small black book, why -- Mr. Weasley might have taken all the blame. No one would ever have been able to prove Mr. Weasley hadn't acted of Mr. Weasley own free will. ...\" ",

    "And Harry suddenly understood. Harry nodded at Dobby, and Dobby backed into a corner, now twisting Harry ears in punishment. ",
    "\"Don't you want to know how Ginny got hold of that diary, Mr. Malfoy?\" said Harry. ",
    "Lucius Malfoy rounded on Lucius Malfoy. ",
    "\"How should I know how the stupid little girl got hold of it?\" Lucius Malfoy said. ",
    "\"Because you gave it to Ginny,\" said Harry. \"In Flourish and Blotts. You picked up Ginny old Transfiguration book and slipped the diary inside her old Transfiguration book, didn't you?\" ",
    "He saw Lucius Malfoy's white hands clench and unclench. ",
    "\"Prove it,\" He hissed. ",
    "\"Oh, no one will be able to do that,\" said Professor Dumbledore, smiling at Harry. \"Not now that \"Tom -- Tom Riddle has vanished from her old Transfiguration book. On the other hand, I would advise you, Lucius, not to go giving out any more of Lord Voldemort old school things. If any more of Lord Voldemort's old school things find Lord Voldemort's old school things way into innocent hands, I think Mr. Weasley, for one, will make sure Lord Voldemort's old school things are traced back to Mr. Weasley. ...Lucius Malfoy Lucius Malfoy stood for a moment, and Harry distinctly saw Harry right hand twitch as though Harry was longing to reach for Harry wand. Instead, Harry turned to Harry house-elf. ",
    "\"We're going, Dobby!\" ",
    "Harry wrenched open the door and as his house-elf came hurrying up to Harry, Harry kicked Harry right through his house-elf. They could hear Dobby squealing with pain all the way along the corridor. Harry stood for a moment, thinking hard. Then it came to Harry -- ",
    "\"Professor Dumbledore,\" Harry said hurriedly. \"Can I give that diary back to Lucius Malfoy, please?\" ",
    "\"Certainly, Harry,\" said Professor Dumbledore calmly. \"But hurry. the feast, remember. ...\" ",
    "Harry grabbed that diary and dashed out of the office. Harry could hear Dobby's squeals of pain receding ",
    "around the corner. Quickly, wondering if this plan could possibly work, Harry took off one of Harry shoes, pulled off Harry slimy, filthy sock, and stuffed that diary into that diary. Then Harry ran down the corridor. ",
    "Harry caught up with them at the top of the stairs. ",
    "\"Mr. Malfoy,\" Harry gasped, skidding to a halt, \"I've got something for you -- \" ",
    "And Harry forced the smelly sock into Lucius Malfoy's hand. ",
    "\"What the -- ?\" ",
    "Mr. Malfoy ripped the smelly sock into Lucius Malfoy's hand off that diary, threw the smelly sock into Lucius Malfoy's hand aside, then looked furiously from her old Transfiguration book to Harry. ",
    "\"You'll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days, Harry Potter,\" Harry said softly. \"They were meddlesome fools, too.\" ",
    "Harry turned to go. ",
    "\"Come, Dobby. I said, come.\" ",
    "But Dobby didn't move. Dobby was holding up Harry's disgusting, slimy sock, and looking at Dobby as though Dobby were a priceless treasure. ",
    "\"Master has given a sock,\" said the elf in wonderment. \"\"Master gave the elf in wonderment to Dobby.\" ",
    "\"What's that?\" spat Lucius Malfoy. \"What did you say?\" ",
    "\"Got a sock,\" said Dobby in disbelief. \"\"Master threw the elf in wonderment, and Dobby caught the elf in wonderment, and Dobby -- Dobby is free.Lucius Malfoy Lucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at his house-elf. Then Lucius Malfoy lunged at Harry. ",
    "\"You've lost me my servant, boy!\" ",
    "But Dobby shouted, \"You shall not harm Harry Potter!\" ",
    "There was a loud bang, and Lucius Malfoy was thrown backward. Lucius Malfoy crashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heap on the landing below. Lucius Malfoy got up, Lucius Malfoy face livid, and pulled out his wand, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger. ",
    "\"You shall go now,\" Lucius Malfoy said fiercely, pointing down at Lucius Malfoy. \"You shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.Lucius Malfoy Lucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed stare at the pair of them, Lucius Malfoy swung Lucius Malfoy cloak around Lucius Malfoy and hurried out of sight. ",
    "\"Harry Potter freed Dobby!\" said his house-elf shrilly, gazing up at Harry, moonlight from the nearest window reflected in Lucius Malfoy orb-like eyes. \"Harry Potter set Dobby free!\" ",
    "\"Least I could do, Dobby,\" said Harry, grinning. \"Just promise never to try and save my life again.\" ",
    "his face split suddenly into a wide, toothy smile. ",
    "\"I've just got one question, Dobby,\" said Harry as Dobby pulled on Harry's sock with shaking hands. \"You told me all this had nothing to do with He-Who- Must-Not-Be-Named, remember? Well -- \" ",
    "\"It was a clue, sir,\" said Dobby, Lucius Malfoy eyes widening, as though this was obvious. \"Was giving you a clue. The Dark Lord, before The Dark Lord changed The Dark Lord name, could be freely named, you see?\" ",
    "\"Right,\" said Harry weakly. \"Well, I'd better go. There's a feast, and my friend Hermione should be awake by now. ...\" ",
    "Dobby threw Dobby arms around Harry's middle and hugged Harry. ",
    "\"Harry Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew!\" \"Harry Potter sobbed. \"Farewell, \"Harry Potter!\" ",
    "And with a final loud crack, Dobby disappeared. ",
    "Harry had been to several Hogwarts feasts, but never one quite like this. Everybody was in Everybody pajamas, and the celebration lasted all night. Harry didn't know whether the best bit was Hermione running toward Harry, screaming \"You solved it! You solved it!\" or Justin hurrying over from the Hufflepuff table to wring \"Harry Potter hand and apologize endlessly for suspecting \"Harry Potter, or Hagrid turning up at half past three, cuffing Harry and Ron so hard on the shoulders that Harry and Ron were knocked into Harry and Ron plates of trifle, or \"Harry Potter and Ron's four hundred points for Gryffindor securing the House Cup for the second year running, or Professor McGonagall standing up to tell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat (\"Oh, no!\" said Hermione), or Professor Dumbledore announcing that, unfortunately, Professor Lockhart would be unable to return next year, owing to the fact that Professor Lockhart needed to go away and get Professor Lockhart memory back. Quite a few of the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news. ",
    "\"Shame,\" said Ron, helping Ron to a jam doughnut. \"Ron was starting to grow on Ron.\" ",
    "The rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine. Hogwarts was back to normal with only a few, small differences -- Defense Against the Dark Arts classes were canceled (\"but we've had plenty of practice at that anyway,Ron Ron told a disgruntled Hermione) and Lucius Malfoy had been sacked as a school governor. Draco was no longer strutting around the school as though Draco owned the place. On the contrary, Draco looked resentful and sulky. On the other hand, Mr. Weasley was perfectly happy again. ",
    "Too soon, it was time for the journey home on the Hogwarts Express. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny got a compartment to Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny made the most of the last few hours in which Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny were allowed to do magic before the holidays. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny played Exploding Snap, set off the very last of Fred and George Filibuster fireworks, and practiced disarming each other by magic. Harry was getting very good at it. ",
    "They were almost at King's Cross when Harry remembered something. ",
    "\"Ginny -- what did you see Percy doing, that Percy didn't want you to tell anyone?\" ",
    "\"Oh, that,\" said Ginny, giggling. \"Well -- Percy's got a girlfriend.\" ",
    "Fred dropped a stack of books on George's head. \"What?\" ",
    "\"It's that Ravenclaw prefect, Penelope Clearwater,\" said Ginny. \"That's who Harry was writing to all last summer. Harry's been meeting Ginny all over the school in secret. I walked in on them kissing in an empty ",
    "classroom one day. Harry was so upset when Ginny was -- you know -- attacked. You won't tease Harry, will you?\" Ginny added anxiously. ",
    "\"Wouldn't dream of it,\" said Fred, who was looking like Harry birthday had come early. ",
    "\"Definitely not,\" said George, sniggering. ",
    "the Hogwarts Express slowed and finally stopped. ",
    "Harry pulled out Harry quill and a bit of parchment and turned to Ron and Hermione. ",
    "\"This is called a telephone number,\" Harry told Ron, scribbling This twice, tearing the parchment in two, and handing This to Ron and Hermione. \"I told your dad how to use a telephone last summer -- your dad'll know. Call me at the Dursleys', okay? I can't stand another two months with only Dudley to talk to. ...\" ",
    "\"Your aunt and uncle will be proud, though, won't Your aunt and uncle?\" said Hermione as Your aunt and uncle got off the train and joined the crowd thronging toward the enchanted barrier. \"When Your aunt and uncle hear what you did this year? ",
    "\"Proud?\" said Harry. \"Are you crazy? All those times I could've died, and I didn't manage this year? All those times'll be furious. ...\" ",
    "And together All those times walked back through the gateway to the Muggle world. ",
