  "DUDLEY DEMENTED": [
    "The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet Drive. Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in Cars that were usually gleaming drives and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing; the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought. Deprived of their usual car-washing and lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet Drive had retreated into the shade of the inhabitants of Privet Drive cool houses, windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze. The only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on The only person left outdoors back in a flower bed outside number four. ",
    "The only person left outdoors was a skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who had the pinched, slightly unhealthy look of someone who has grown a lot in a short space of time. The only person left outdoors jeans were torn and dirty, The only person left outdoors T-shirt baggy and faded, and the soles of The only person left outdoors trainers were peeling away from the uppers. Harry Potter's appearance did not endear The only person left outdoors to the neighbors, who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be  ",
    "punishable by law, but as The only person left outdoors had hidden The only person left outdoors behind a large hydrangea bush this evening The only person left outdoors was quite invisible to passersby. In fact, the only way The only person left outdoors would be spotted was if The only person left outdoors Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia stuck his Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia heads out of the living room window and looked straight down into the flower bed below. ",
    "On the whole, Harry thought Harry was to be congratulated on Harry idea of hiding here. Harry was not, perhaps, very comfortable lying on the hot, hard earth, but on the other hand, nobody was glaring at Harry, grinding their teeth so loudly that Harry could not hear the news, or shooting nasty questions at Harry, as had happened every time Harry had tried sitting down in the living room and watching television with Harry aunt and uncle. ",
    "Almost as though this thought had fluttered through the open window, Vernon Dursley, Harry's uncle, suddenly spoke. \"Glad to see the boy's stopped trying to butt in. Where is the boy anyway?\" ",
    "\"I don't know,\" said Aunt Petunia unconcernedly. \"Not in the house.\" ",
    "Uncle Vernon grunted. ",
    "\"Watching the news ...\" the boy said scathingly. \"I'd like to know what the boy's really up to. As if a normal boy cares what's on the news -- Dudley hasn't got a clue what's going on, doubt Dudley knows who the Prime Minister is! Anyway, it's not as if there 'd be anything about the Prime Minister lot on our news -- \" ",
    "\"Vernon, shh\\\" said Aunt Petunia. \"The window's open!\" ",
    "\"Oh -- yes -- sorry, dear ...\" ",
    "The Dursleys fell silent. Harry listened to a jingle about Fruit 'N Bran breakfast cereal while Harry watched Mrs. Figg, amble slowly past. Aunt Petunia was frowning and muttering to Aunt Petunia. Harry was very pleased that Harry was concealed behind the bush; Mrs. Figg had recently taken to asking Harry around for tea whenever Mrs. Figg met Harry in the street. Mrs. Figg had rounded the corner and vanished from view before Uncle Vernon's voice floated out of the window again. ",
    "\"Dudders out for tea?\" ",
    "\"At the Polkisses',\" said Aunt Petunia fondly. \"Harry's got so many little friends, Harry's so popular ...\" ",
    "Harry repressed a snort with difficulty. The Dursleys really were astonishingly stupid about The Dursleys son, Dudley; their son, Dudley had swallowed all Dudley dim-witted lies about having tea with a different member of Dudley gang every night of the summer holidays. Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley had not been to tea anywhere; Harry and his gang spent every evening vandalizing the play park, smoking on street corners, and throwing stones at passing cars and children. Harry had seen them at it during Harry evening walks around Little Whinging; Harry had spent most of the holidays wandering the streets, scavenging newspapers from bins along the way. ",
    "The opening notes of the music that heralded the seven o'clock news reached Harry's ears and Harry stomach turned over. Perhaps tonight -- after a month of waiting -- would be the night -- ",
    "\"Record numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill airports as the Spanish baggage-handlers' strike reaches the Spanish baggage-handlers' strike second week -- \" ",
    "\"Give 'em a lifelong siesta, I would,\" snarled Uncle Vernon over the end of the newsreader's sentence, but no matter: Outside in the flower bed, Harry's stomach seemed to unclench. If anything had happened, it would surely have been the first item on the news; death and destruction were more important than stranded holidaymakers... ",
    "Uncle Vernon let out a long, slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky. Every day this summer had been the same: the tension, the expectation, the temporary relief, and then mounting tension again . . . and always, growing more insistent all the time, the question of why nothing had happened yet... ",
    "Uncle Vernon kept listening, just in case there was some small clue, not recognized for what it really was by the Muggles -- an unexplained disappearance, perhaps, or some strange accident ... but the Spanish baggage-handlers' strike was followed by news on the drought in the Southeast (\"I hope Uncle Vernon's listening next door!\" bellowed Uncle Vernon, \"with Uncle Vernon sprinklers on at three in the morning!\"); then a helicopter that had almost crashed in a field in Surrey, then a famous actress's divorce from a famous actress famous husband (\"as if we're interested in some small clue, not recognized for what it really was by the Muggles -- an unexplained disappearance, perhaps, or some strange accident sordid affairs,\" sniffed Aunt Petunia, who had followed case obsessively in every magazine a famous actress could lay a famous actress bony hands on). ",
    "Harry closed Harry eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the newsreader said, \"And finally, Bungy the budgie has found a novel way of keeping cool this summer. Bungy, who lives at the Five Feathers in Barnsley, has learned to water-ski! Mary Dorkins went to find out more...\" ",
    "Harry opened his eyes again. If they had reached water-skiing budgerigars, there was nothing else worth hearing. Harry rolled cautiously onto Harry front and ",
    "raised Harry onto Harry knees and elbows, preparing to crawl out from under the window. ",
    "Harry had moved about two inches when several things happened in very quick succession. ",
    "A loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot; a cat streaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight; a shriek, a bellowed oath, and the sound of breaking china came from the Dursleys' living room, and as though Harry had been waiting for this signal, Harry jumped to Harry feet, at the same time pulling from the waistband of Harry jeans a thin wooden wand as if Harry were unsheathing a sword. But before Harry could draw Harry up to full height, the top of Harry head collided with the Dursleys' open window, and the resultant crash made Aunt Petunia scream even louder. ",
    "Harry felt as if his head had been split in two; eyes streaming, Harry swayed, trying to focus on the street and spot the source of the noise, but Harry had barely staggered upright again when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around Harry throat. ",
    "\"Put -- it -- away\\\" Uncle Vernon snarled into Harry's ear. \"Now\\ Before -- anyone -- sees!\" ",
    "\"Get -- off -- me!\" Harry gasped; for a few seconds they struggled, Harry pulling at Harry uncle's sausage- like fingers with Harry left hand, Harry right maintaining a firm grip on Harry raised wand. Then, as the pain in the top of Harry's head gave a particularly nasty throb, Uncle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though Uncle Vernon had received an electric shock -- some invisible force seemed to have surged through Uncle Vernon nephew, making Uncle Vernon impossible to hold. ",
    "Panting, Harry fell forward over the hydrangea bush, straightened up, and stared around. There was no sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise, but there were several faces peering through various nearby windows. Harry stuffed Harry wand hastily back into Harry jeans and tried to look innocent. ",
    "\"Lovely evening!\" shouted Uncle Vernon, waving at Mrs. Number Seven, who was glaring from behind Uncle Vernon net curtains. \"Did you hear that car backfire just now? Gave Petunia and me quite a turn!\" ",
    "Harry continued to grin in a horrible, manic way until all the curious neighbors had disappeared from all the curious neighbors various windows, then the grin became a grimace of rage as Harry beckoned Harry back toward Harry. ",
    "Harry moved a few steps closer, taking care to stop just short of the point at which Uncle Vernon's outstretched hands could resume their strangling. ",
    "\"What the devil do you mean by the devil, boy?\" asked Uncle Vernon in a croaky voice that trembled with fury. ",
    "\"What do I mean by what?\" said Harry coldly. Harry kept looking left and right up the street, still hoping to see the person who had made the cracking noise. ",
    "\"Making a racket like a starting pistol right outside our -- \" ",
    "\"I didn't make the cracking noise,\" said Harry firmly. ",
    "Aunt Petunia's thin, horsey face now appeared beside Uncle Vernon wide, purple one. Aunt Petunia looked livid. ",
    "\"Why were you lurking under our window?\" ",
    "\"Yes -- yes, good point, Aunt Petunia! What were you doing under our window, boy?\" ",
    "\"Listening to the news,\" said Harry in a resigned voice. ",
    "Harry aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage. ",
    "\"Listening to the news! Again?\" ",
    "\"Well, it changes every day, you see,\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Don't you be clever with Harry, boy! I want to know what you're really up to -- and don't give me any more of this listening to the news tosh! You know perfectly well that your lot ...\" ",
    "\"Careful, Uncle Vernon's!\" breathed Aunt Petunia, and Uncle Vernon lowered Uncle Vernon voice so that Harry could barely hear Harry, \"... that your lot don't get on our news!\" ",
    "\"That's all you know,\" said Harry. ",
    "The Dursleys goggled at Harry for a few seconds, then Aunt Petunia said, \"You're a nasty little liar. What are all those -- \" Aunt Petunia too lowered his voice so that Harry had to lip-read the next word, \" -- owls -- doing if they're not bringing you news?\" ",
    "\"Aha!\" said Uncle Vernon in a triumphant whisper. \"Get out of that one, boy! As if we didn't know you get all your news from those pestilential birds!\" ",
    "Harry hesitated for a moment. It cost \" ",
    "Harry something to tell the truth this time, even though \" ",
    "Harry aunt and uncle could not possibly know how bad Harry felt at admitting it. ",
    "\"The owls ... aren't bringing me news,\" said Harry tonelessly. ",
    "\"I don't believe it,\" said Aunt Petunia at once. ",
    "\"No more do I,\" said Uncle Vernon forcefully. ",
    "\"We know you're up to something funny,\" said Aunt Petunia. ",
    "\"We're not stupid, you know,\" said Uncle Vernon. ",
    "\"Well, that's news to me,\" said Harry, Harry temper rising, and before The Dursleys could call Harry back, Harry had wheeled about, crossed the front lawn, stepped over the low garden wall, and was striding off up the street. ",
    "Harry was in trouble now and Harry knew it. Harry would have to face His aunt and uncle later and pay the price for Harry rudeness, but Harry did not care very much just at the moment; Harry had much more pressing matters on Harry mind. ",
    "Harry was sure that the cracking noise had been made by someone Apparating or Disapparating. It was exactly the sound Dobby the house-elf made when Dobby the house-elf vanished into thin air. Was it possible that Dobby the house-elf was here in Privet Drive? Could Dobby the house-elf be following Dobby the house-elf right at this very moment? As this thought occurred Dobby the house-elf wheeled around and stared back down Privet Drive, but this thought occurred appeared to be completely deserted again and Harry was sure that Dobby the house-elf did not know how to become invisible... ",
    "Dobby the house-elf walked on, hardly aware of the route Dobby the house-elf was taking, for Dobby the house-elf had pounded these streets so often lately that Dobby the house-elf carried Dobby the house-elf to Dobby the house-elf favorite haunts automatically. Every few steps Dobby the house-elf glanced back over ",
    "Dobby the house-elf shoulder. Someone magical had been near Dobby the house-elf as Dobby the house-elf lay among Aunt Petunias dying begonias, Dobby the house-elf was sure of it. Why hadn't they spoken to Dobby the house-elf, why hadn't they made contact, why were they hiding now? ",
    "And then, as Dobby the house-elf feeling of frustration peaked, Dobby the house-elf certainty leaked away. ",
    "Perhaps his certainty hadn't been a magical sound after all. Perhaps Dobby the house-elf was so desperate for the tiniest sign of contact from the world to which Dobby the house-elf belonged that Dobby the house-elf was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises. Could Dobby the house-elf be sure it hadn't been the sound of something breaking inside a neighbor's house? ",
    "Harry felt a dull, sinking sensation in Harry stomach and, before Harry knew it, the feeling of hopelessness that had plagued Harry all summer rolled over Harry once again... ",
    "Tomorrow morning Harry would be awoken by the alarm at five o'clock so that Harry could pay the owl that delivered the Daily Prophet -- but was there any point in continuing to take it? Harry merely glanced at the front page before throwing the front page aside these days; when the idiots who ran the paper finally realized that Voldemort was back the paper would be headline news, and that was the only kind Harry cared about. ",
    "If Harry was lucky, there would also be owls carrying letters from Harry best friends, Ron and Hermione, though any expectation Harry had had that his best friends, Ron and Hermione letters would bring Harry news had long since been dashed. ",
    "\"We can't say much about you-know-what, obviously...\" \"We've been told not to say anything important in case We go astray...\" \"We're quite busy but I can't give you details here...\" \"There's a fair ",
    "amount going on, We'll tell you everything when We see you...\" ",
    "But when were they going to see Harry? Nobody seemed too bothered with a precise date. Hermione had scribbled, \"I expect We'll be seeing you quite soon\" inside Hermione birthday card, but how soon was soon? As far as Harry could tell from the vague hints in their letters, Hermione and Ron were in the same place, presumably at Ron's parents' house. presumably at Ron's parents' house could hardly bear to think of the pair of Hermione and Ron having fun at the Burrow when presumably at Ron's parents' house was stuck in Privet Drive. In fact, presumably at Ron's parents' house was so angry at Hermione and Ron that presumably at Ron's parents' house had thrown both Hermione and Ron birthday presents of Honeydukes chocolates away unopened, though presumably at Ron's parents' house had regretted this after eating the wilting salad Aunt Petunia had provided for dinner that night. ",
    "And what were Ron and Hermione busy with? Why wasn't he, Harry, busy? Hadn't he proved he capable of handling much more than he, Harry? Had they all forgotten what he had done? Hadn't it been he who had entered that graveyard and watched Cedric being murdered and been tied to that tombstone and nearly killed ... ? ",
    "Don't think about that, Harry told Harry sternly for the hundredth time that summer. It was bad enough that Harry kept revisiting that graveyard in Harry nightmares, without dwelling on it in Harry waking moments too. ",
    "Harry turned a corner into Magnolia Crescent; halfway along Harry passed the narrow alleyway down the side of a garage where Harry had first clapped eyes on Harry godfather. Sirius, at least, seemed to understand how Harry was feeling; admittedly Harry letters were just as empty of proper news as Ron and Hermione's, but at ",
    "least Ron and Hermione contained words of caution and consolation instead of tantalizing hints: ",
    "\" I know this must be frustrating for you...\" \"Keep your nose clean and everything will be okay...\" \"Be careful and don't do anything rash...\" ",
    "Well, thought Harry, as Harry crossed Magnolia Crescent, turned into Magnolia Road, and headed toward the darkening play park, Harry had (by and large) done as Sirius advised; Harry had at least resisted the temptation to tie Harry trunk to Harry broomstick and set off for the Burrow by Harry. In fact Harry thought Harry behavior had been very good considering how frustrated and angry Harry felt at being stuck in Privet Drive this long, reduced to hiding in flower beds in the hope of hearing something that might point to what Lord Voldemort was doing. Nevertheless, it was quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man who had served twelve years in the wizard prison, ",
    "Azkaban, escaped, attempted to commit the murder Harry had been convicted for in the first place, then gone on the run with a stolen hippogriff. . . ",
    "Harry vaulted over the locked park gate and set off across the parched grass. The park was as empty as the surrounding streets. When Harry reached the swings Harry sank onto the only one that Dudley and Dudley friends had not yet managed to break, coiled one arm around the chain, and stared moodily at the ground. Harry would not be able to hide in the Dursleys' flower bed again. Tomorrow Harry would have to think of some fresh way of listening to the news. In the meantime, Harry had nothing to look forward to but another restless, disturbed night, because even when Harry escaped nightmares about Cedric Harry had unsettling dreams about long dark corridors, all finishing in dead ends and locked doors, which Harry supposed had something to do with the trapped feeling Harry had when  ",
    "Harry was awake. Often the old scar on Harry forehead prickled uncomfortably, but Harry did not fool Harry that Ron and Hermione Sirius would find that very interesting anymore... In the past Harry scar hurting had warned that Lord Voldemort was getting stronger again, but now that Lord Voldemort was back Ron and Hermione would probably remind Harry that its regular irritation was only to be expected... Nothing to worry about ... old news ... ",
    "The injustice of it all welled up inside Harry so that Harry wanted to yell with fury. If it hadn't been for Harry, nobody would even have known Lord Voldemort was back! And Harry reward was to be stuck in Little Whinging for four solid weeks, completely cut off from the magical world, reduced to squatting among dying begonias so that Harry could hear about water-skiing budgerigars! How could Dumbledore have forgotten Dumbledore so easily? Why had Ron and Hermione got together without inviting Dumbledore along too? How much longer was Dumbledore supposed to endure Sirius telling Dumbledore to sit tight and be a good boy; or resist the temptation to write to the stupid Daily Prophet and point out that Lord Voldemort had returned? These furious thoughts whirled around in Harry's head, and Harry insides writhed with anger as a sultry, velvety night fell around Harry, the air full of the smell of warm, dry grass and the only sound that of the low grumble of traffic on the road beyond the park railings. ",
    "Harry did not know how long Harry had sat on the swing before the sound of voices interrupted Harry musings and Harry looked up. The street-lamps from the surrounding roads were casting a misty glow strong enough to silhouette a group of people making their way across The park. One of their was singing a loud, crude song. The others were laughing. A soft ticking noise came from several expensive racing bikes that The others were wheeling along. ",
    "Harry knew who those people were. The figure in front was unmistakably Harry cousin, Dudley Dursley, wending Harry way home, accompanied by Harry faithful gang. ",
    "Dudley was as vast as ever, but a year's hard dieting and the discovery of a new talent had wrought quite a change in Dudley physique. As Uncle Vernon delightedly told anyone who would listen, Dudley had recently become the Junior Heavyweight Inter-School Boxing Champion of the Southeast. \"The noble sport,\" as Uncle Vernon called it, had made Dudley even more formidable than Dudley had seemed to Harry in the primary school days when Dudley had served as Dudley's first punching bag. Harry was not remotely afraid of Harry cousin anymore but Harry still didn't think that Dudley learning to punch harder and more accurately was cause for celebration. Neighborhood children all around were terrified of Harry -- even more terrified than Neighborhood children all around were of \"that Potter boy,\" who, Neighborhood children all around had been warned, was a hardened hooligan who attended St. Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys. ",
    "Harry watched the dark figures crossing the grass and wondered whom Neighborhood children all around had been beating up tonight. Look round, Harry found Harry thinking as Harry watched Neighborhood children all around. Come on ... look round ... I'm sitting here all alone... Come and have ago... ",
    "If Dudley's friends saw Dudley sitting here, Dudley's friends would be sure to make a beeline for Dudley, and what would Dudley do then? Dudley wouldn't want to lose face in front of the gang, but Dudley'd be terrified of provoking Harry. . . It would be really fun to watch Dudley's dilemma; to taunt Dudley, watch Dudley, with Dudley powerless to respond . . . and if any of the others tried hitting Harry, Harry was ready -- Harry had Harry wand . . . let Dudley's friends try ... Harry'd love to vent some of Harry  ",
    "frustration on the boys who had once made Harry life hell -- ",
    "But they did not turn around, they did not see Harry, they were almost at the railings. Harry mastered the impulse to call after they... Seeking a fight was not a smart move... Harry must not use magic... Harry would be risking expulsion again... ",
    "Dudley's gang's voices died; Dudley's gang's voices were out of sight, heading along Magnolia Road. ",
    "There you go, Sirius, Harry thought dully. Nothing rash. Kept my nose clean. Exactly the opposite of what you'd have done ... ",
    "Harry got to Harry feet and stretched. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon seemed to feel that whenever Dudley turned up was the right time to be home, and anytime after that was much too late. Uncle Vernon had threatened to lock Harry in the shed if Uncle Vernon came home after Dudley again, so, stifling a yawn, still scowling, Harry set off toward the locked park gate. ",
    "Magnolia Road, like Privet Drive, was full of large, square houses with perfectly manicured lawns, all owned by large, square owners who drove very clean cars similar to Uncle Vernon. Harry preferred Little Whinging by night, when the curtained windows made patches of jewel-bright colors in the darkness and Harry ran no danger of hearing disapproving mutters about Harry \"delinquent\" appearance when Harry passed the householders. Harry walked quickly, so that halfway along Magnolia Road Dudley's gang came into view again; Magnolia Road Dudley's gang were saying Magnolia Road Dudley's gang farewells at the entrance to Magnolia Crescent. Harry stepped into the shadow of a large lilac tree and waited. ",
    "\"... squealed like a pig, didn't Harry?\" Harry was saying, to guffaws from the others. ",
    "\"Nice right hook, Big D,\" said Piers. ",
    "\"Same time tomorrow?\" said Dudley. ",
    "\"Round at my place, my parents are out,\" said Gordon. ",
    "\"See you then,\" said Dudley. ",
    "\"Bye Dud!\" ",
    "\"See ya, Big D!\" ",
    "Harry waited for the rest of Magnolia Road Dudley's gang to move on before setting off again. When their voices had faded once more Harry headed around the corner into Magnolia Crescent and by walking very quickly Harry soon came within hailing distance of Dudley, who was strolling along at Harry ease, humming tunelessly. ",
    "\"Hey, Big D!\" ",
    "Dudley turned. ",
    "\"Oh,\" Harry grunted. \"It's you.\" ",
    "\"How long have you been 'Big D' then?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Shut it,\" snarled Dudley, turning away again. ",
    "\"Cool name,\" said Harry, grinning and falling into step beside his cousin. \"But you'll always be Ickle Diddykins to Harry.\" ",
    "\"I said, SHUT IT!\" said Dudley, whose ham-like hands had curled into fists. ",
    "\"Don't the boys know that's what your mum calls you?\" ",
    "\"Shut your face.\" ",
    "\"You don't tell your mum to shut your face. What about 'popkin' and 'Dinky Diddydums,' can I use 'popkin' and 'Dinky Diddydums then?\" ",
    "Dudley said nothing. The effort of keeping himself from hitting Harry seemed to be demanding all himself self-control. ",
    "\"So who've you been beating up tonight?\" Harry asked, Harry grin fading. \"Another ten-year-old? I know you did Mark Evans two nights ago -- \" ",
    "\"Mark Evans was asking for it,\" snarled Dudley. ",
    "\"Oh yeah?\" ",
    "\"Mark Evans cheeked me.\" ",
    "\"Yeah? Did Mark Evans say you look like a pig that's been taught to walk on its hind legs? 'Cause that's not cheek, Dud, that's true ...\" ",
    "A muscle was twitching in Dudley's jaw. It gave Harry enormous satisfaction to know how furious Harry was making Dudley; Harry felt as though Harry was siphoning off Harry own frustration into his cousin, the only outlet Harry had. ",
    "They turned right down the narrow alleyway where Harry had first seen Sirius and which formed a shortcut between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. It was empty and much darker than the streets It linked because there were no streetlamps. They ",
    "footsteps were muffled between garage walls on one side and a high fence on the other. ",
    "\"Think you're a big man carrying that thing, don't you?\" Dudley said after a few seconds. ",
    "\"What thing?\" ",
    "\"That -- that thing you're hiding.\" ",
    "Harry grinned again. ",
    "\"Not as stupid as you look, are you, Dud? But I s'pose if you were, you wouldn't be able to walk and talk at the same time...\" ",
    "Harry pulled out \" ",
    "Harry . \" ",
    "Harry saw Dudley look sideways at his wand. ",
    "\"You're not allowed,\" Dudley said at once. \"I know you're not. You'd get expelled from that freak school you go to.\" ",
    "\"How d'you know d'you haven't changed the rules, Big D?\" ",
    "\"d'you haven't,\" said Dudley, though Dudley didn't sound completely convinced. Harry laughed softly. ",
    "\"You haven't got the guts to take me on without that thing, have you?\" Dudley snarled. ",
    "\"Whereas you just need four mates behind you before you can beat up a ten-year-old. You know that boxing title you keep banging on about? How old was your opponent? Seven? Eight?\" ",
    "\"Dudley was sixteen for your information,\" snarled Dudley, \"and Dudley was out cold for twenty minutes after ",
    "I'd finished with Dudley and Dudley was twice as heavy as you. You just wait till I tell Dad you had that thing out -- \" ",
    "\"Running to Daddy now, are you? Is Dudley ickle boxing champ frightened of nasty Harry's wand?\" ",
    "\"Not this brave at night, are you?\" sneered Dudley. ",
    "\"This is night, Diddykins. That's what we call it when it goes all dark like this.\" ",
    "\"I mean when you're in bed!\" Dudley snarled. ",
    "Dudley had stopped walking. Harry stopped too, staring at his cousin. From the little Harry could see of Dudley's large face, Harry was wearing a strangely triumphant look. ",
    "\"What d'you mean, I'm not brave in bed?\" said Harry, completely nonplussed. \"What -- am I supposed to be frightened of pillows or something?\" ",
    "\"I heard you last night,\" said Dudley breathlessly. \"Talking in your sleep. Moaning.\" ",
    "\"What d'you mean?\" Harry said again, but there was a cold, plunging sensation in Harry stomach. Harry had revisited the graveyard last night in Harry dreams. ",
    "Dudley gave a harsh bark of laughter then adopted a high-pitched, whimpering voice. \" 'Don't kill Cedric! Don't kill Cedric!' Who's Cedric -- your boyfriend?\" ",
    "\"I -- you're lying -- \" said Harry automatically. But Harry mouth had gone dry. Harry knew Dudley wasn't lying -- how else would Harry know about Cedric? ",
    "\" T)ad! Help me, Dad! Harry's going to kill me, Dad! Boo- hoo!\"' ",
    "\"Shut up,\" said Harry quietly. \"Shut up, Dudley, I'm warning you!\" ",
    "\" 'Come and help me, Dad! Mum, come and help me! Harry's killed Cedric! Dad, help me! Harry's going to -- ' Don't you point that thing at me\\\" ",
    "Dudley backed into the alley wall. Harry was pointing his wand directly at Dudley's heart. Harry could feel fourteen years' hatred of Dudley pounding in Harry veins -- what wouldn't Harry give to strike now, to jinx Dudley so thoroughly Harry'd have to crawl home like an insect, struck dumb, sprouting feelers -- ",
    "\"Don't ever talk about that again,\" Harry snarled. \"D'you understand me?\" ",
    "\"Point that thing somewhere else!\" ",
    "\"I said, do you understand me?\" ",
    "\"Point it somewhere else\\\" ",
    "\"DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?\" ",
    "\"GET THAT THING AWAY FROM -- \" ",
    "Dudley gave an odd, shuddering gasp, as though Dudley had been doused in icy water. ",
    "Something had happened to the night. The star- strewn indigo sky was suddenly pitch-black and lightless -- the stars, the moon, the misty streetlamps at either end of the alley had vanished. The distant grumble of cars and the whisper of trees had gone. ",
    "The balmy evening was suddenly piercingly, bitingly  ",
    "cold. They were surrounded by total, impenetrable, silent darkness, as though some giant hand had dropped a thick, icy mantle over the entire alleyway, blinding They. ",
    "For a split second Harry thought Harry had done magic without meaning to, despite the fact that Harry'd been resisting as hard as Harry could -- then Harry reason caught up with Harry senses -- Harry didn't have the power to turn off the stars. Harry turned Harry head this way and that, trying to see something, but the darkness pressed on Harry eyes like a weightless veil. ",
    "Dudley's terrified voice broke in Harry's ear. ",
    "\"W-what are you d-doing? St-stop it!\" ",
    "\"I'm not doing anything! Shut up and don't move!\" ",
    "\"I c-can't see! I've g-gone blind! I -- \" ",
    "\"I said shut up!\" ",
    "Harry stood stock-still, turning his eyes left and right. The cold was so intense that Harry was shivering all over; goose bumps had erupted up Harry arms, and the hairs on the back of Harry neck were standing up -- Harry opened his eyes to their fullest extent, staring blankly around, unseeing . . . ",
    "It was impossible... their couldn't be here... Not in Little Whinging ... Harry strained Harry ears... Harry would hear their before Harry saw their... ",
    "\"I'll t-tell Dad!\" Dudley whimpered. \"W-where are you? What are you d-do -- ?\" ",
    "\"Will you shut up?\" Harry hissed, \"I'm trying to lis -- \" ",
    "But Harry fell silent. Harry had heard just the thing Harry had been dreading. ",
    "There was something in the alleyway apart from themselves, something that was drawing long, hoarse, rattling breaths. Harry felt a horrible jolt of dread as Harry stood trembling in the freezing air. ",
    "\"C-cut it out! Stop doing it! Ill h-hit you, I swear I will!\" ",

Dudley seemed to be on the point of fainting: Dudley small eyes were rolling in their sockets and sweat was beading Dudley face; the moment Harry let go of Dudley Dudley swayed dangerously. ",
    "\"Hurry up!\" said Mrs. Figg hysterically. ",

Scowling, Harryreadjusted Dudley on Harry shoulder and made Harry slow, painful way up number four's garden path. ",
    "The hall light was on. Harry stuck his wand back inside the waistband of Harry jeans, rang the bell, and watched Aunt Petunia's outline grow larger and larger, oddly distorted by the rippling glass in the front door. ",

    "Harry's uncle came galumphing out of the living room, walrus mustache blowing hither and thither as it always did when Harry's uncle was agitated. Harry's uncle hurried forward to help Aunt Petunia negotiate a weak-kneed Dudley over the threshold while avoiding stepping in the pool of sick. ",
    "\"Harry's uncle's ill, Vernon!\" ",

    "With a feeling of mingled dread and anger, Harry removed Harry foot slowly from the bottommost stair and turned to follow the Dursleys. ",
    "The scrupulously clean kitchen had an oddly unreal glitter after the darkness outside. Aunt Petunia was ushering Dudley into a chair; Aunt Petunia was still very green and clammy looking. Vernon was standing in front of the draining board, glaring at Harry through tiny, narrowed eyes. ",
    "\"What have you done to son?\" son said in a menacing growl. ",
    "\"Nothing,\" said Harry, knowing perfectly well that Vernon wouldn't believe son. ",
    "\"What did son do to Harry, \"Diddy?\" Aunt Petunia said in a quavering voice, now sponging sick from the front of Dudley's leather jacket. \"Was it -- was it you-know- what, darling? Did son use -- son thing?\" ",
    "Slowly, tremulously, Dudley nodded. ",
    "\"I didn't!\" Harry said sharply, as Aunt Petunia let out a wail and Vernon raised Harry fists. \"I didn't do anything to Harry, it wasn't me, it was -- \" ",
    "But at that precise moment a screech owl swooped in through the kitchen window.

",
    "\"OWLS!\" bellowed Uncle Vernon, the well-worn vein in Uncle Vernon temple pulsing angrily as Uncle Vernon slammed the kitchen window shut. \"OWLS AGAIN! I WILL NOT HAVE ANY MORE OWLS IN MY HOUSE!\" ",
    "But Harry was already ripping open the large parchment envelope it was carrying in its beak at Harry's feet and pulling out the letter inside, Harry heart pounding somewhere in the region of Harry Adam's apple. ",

    "\"The first one was from the Ministry of Magic, expelling me,\" said Harry calmly; Harry was straining Harry ears to catch noises outside in case the Ministry representatives were approaching, and it was easier and quieter to answer Vernon questions than to have Vernon start raging and bellowing. \"The second one was from my friend Ron's dad, The second one works at the Ministry of Magic.\" ",

    "Vernon opened her mouth, closed her mouth again, opened her mouth once more, shut her mouth, then, apparently struggling to remember how to talk, opened her mouth for a third time and croaked, \"So -- so -- they -- er -- they -- er -- they actually exist, do they -- er -- dementy- whatsits?\" ",
    "Aunt Petunia nodded. ",
    "Vernon looked from Aunt Petunia to Dudley to Harry as if hoping somebody was going to shout \"April Fool!\" When nobody did, nobody opened nobody yet again, but was spared the struggle to find more words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening, which zoomed through the still-open window like a feathery cannonball and landed with a clatter on the kitchen table, causing all three of the Dursleys to jump with fright. Harry tore a second official-looking envelope from the owl's beak and ripped the owl's beak open as the owl swooped back out into the night. ",
    "\"Enough -- effing -- owls ...\" muttered Vernon distractedly, stomping over to the window and slamming the window shut again. ",
    "Dear Mr. Potter, ",
    "Further to our letter of approximately twenty-two minutes ago, the Ministry of Magic ANYMORE MAGIC has revised the Ministry of Magic decision to destroy your wand forthwith. You may retain your wand until your disciplinary hearing on 12th August, at which time an official decision will be taken. ",
    "Following discussions with the Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the Ministry of Magic has agreed that the question of your expulsion will also be decided at that time. You should therefore consider yourself suspended from school pending further inquiries. ",
    "With best wishes, ",
    "Yours sincerely, ",
    "Mafalda Hopkirk ",
    "IMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE ",
    "Ministry of Magic ",
    "Harry read this letter through three times in quick succession. The miserable knot in his chest loosened slightly at the thought that his was not definitely expelled, though his fears were by no means banished. Everything seemed to hang on this hearing on the twelfth of August. ",
    "\"Well?\" said Vernon, recalling Harry to Harry surroundings. \"What now? Have they sentenced you to anything? Do your lot have the death penalty?\" Vernon added as a hopeful afterthought. ",
    "\"I've got to go to a hearing,\" said Harry. ",
    "\"And they'll sentence you there?\" ",
    "\"I suppose so.\" ",
    "\"I won't give up hope, then,\" said Uncle Vernon nastily. ",
    "\"Well, if that's all,\" said Harry, getting to Harry feet. Harry was desperate to be alone, to think, perhaps to send a letter to Ron, Hermione, or Sirius. ",
    "\"NO, IT RUDDY WELL IS NOT ALL!\" bellowed Vernon. \"SIT BACK DOWN!\" ",
    "\"What now?\" said Harry impatiently. ",
    "\"DUDLEY!\" roared Vernon. \"I want to know exactly what happened to son!\" ",
    "\"FINE!\" yelled Harry, and in Harry temper, red and gold sparks shot out of the end of Harry wand, still clutched ",
    "in Harry hand. All three Dursleys flinched, looking terrified. ",
    "\"Dudley and I were in the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk,\" said Harry, speaking fast, fighting to control Harry temper. \"Dudley thought Dudley'd be smart with Harry, I pulled out his wand but didn't use his wand. Then two dementors turned up -- \" ",
    "\"But what ARE dementoids?\" asked Vernon furiously. \"What do they DO?\" ",
    "\"I told you -- they suck all the happiness out of you,\" said Harry, \"and if they get the chance, they kiss you ",
    "\"Kiss you?\" said Vernon, Vernon eyes popping slightly. \"Kiss you?\" ",
    "\"It's what they call it when they suck the soul out of your mouth.\" ",
    "Aunt Petunia uttered a soft scream. ",
    "\"the soul? they didn't take -- \" ",
    "Aunt Petunia's still got \" ",
    "Aunt Petunia -- \" ",
    "She seized Dudley by the shoulders and shook \" ",
    "Aunt Petunia, as though testing to see whether She could hear the soul rattling around inside \" ",
    "Aunt Petunia. ",
    "\"Of course they didn't get the soul, you'd know if they had,\" said Harry, exasperated. ",
    "\"Fought 'em off, did you, son?\" said Vernon loudly, with the appearance of a man struggling to bring the conversation back onto a plane Vernon understood. \"Gave 'em the old one-two, did you?\" ",
    "\"You can't give a dementor the old one-two,\" said Harry through clenched teeth. ",
    "\"Why's he all right, then?\" blustered Vernon. \"Why isn't he all empty, then?\" ",
    "\"Because I used the Patronus -- \" ",
    "WHOOSH. With a clattering, a whirring of wings, and a soft fall of dust, a fourth owl came shooting out of the kitchen fireplace. ",
    "\"FOR GOD'S SAKE!\" roared Vernon, pulling great clumps of hair out of Vernon mustache, something Vernon hadn't been driven to in a long time. \"I WILL NOT HAVE OWLS HERE, I WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS, I TELL YOU!\" ",
    "But Harry was already pulling a roll of parchment from a fourth owl's leg. Harry was so convinced that this letter had to be from Dumbledore, explaining everything -- the dementors, Mrs. Figg, what the Ministry of Magic was up to, how Harry, Dumbledore, intended to sort everything out -- that for the first time in Harry life Harry was disappointed to see Sirius's handwriting. Ignoring Uncle Vernon's ongoing rant about owls and narrowing Ignoring Uncle Vernon eyes against a second cloud of dust as the most recent owl took off back up the chimney, Harry read Sirius's message. ",
    "Arthur's just told us what's happened. ",
    "Don't leave the house again, whatever you do. ",
    "Harry found this such an inadequate response to everything that had happened tonight that Harry turned the piece of parchment over, looking for the rest of this letter, but there was nothing there. ",
    "And now Harry temper was rising again. Wasn't anybody going to say \"well done\" for fighting off two dementors single-handedly? Both Mr. Weasley and Sirius were acting as though Harry'd misbehaved and Both Mr. Weasley and Sirius were saving Both Mr. Weasley and Sirius tellings-off until Both Mr. Weasley and Sirius could ascertain how much damage had been done. ",
    "\" -- a peck, I mean, pack of owls shooting in and out of my house and I won't have it, boy, I won't -- \" ",
    "\"I can't stop owls coming,Harry Harry snapped, crushing Sirius's letter in Harry fist. ",
    "\"I want the truth about what happened tonight!\" barked Vernon. \"If it was demenders who hurt Dudley, how come you've been expelled? You did you- know-what, you've admitted it was demenders who hurt Dudley!\" ",
    "Harry took a deep, steadying breath. Harry head was beginning to ache again. Harry wanted more than anything to get out of the kitchen, away from the Dursleys. ",
    "\"I did the Patronus Charm to get rid of the dementors,\" Harry said, forcing Harry to remain calm. \"It's the only thing that works against Both Mr. Weasley and Sirius.\" ",
    "\"But what were dementoids doing in Little Whinging?\" said Vernon in tones of outrage. ",
    "\"Couldn't tell you,\" said Harry wearily. \"No idea.\" ",
    "His head was pounding in the glare of the strip lighting now. Harry anger was ebbing away. Harry felt drained, exhausted. the Dursleys were all staring at Harry. ",
    "\"It's you,\" said Vernon forcefully. \"It's got something to do with you, boy, I know It. Why else ",
    "would they turn up here? Why else would they be down that alleyway? You've got to be the only -- the only -- \" Evidently Harry couldn't bring Harry to say the word \"wizard.\" \"The only you-know-what for miles.\" ",
    "\"I don't know why they were here...\" ",
    "But at these words of Vernon, Harry's exhausted brain ground back into action. Why had the dementors come to Little Whinging? How could it be coincidence that they had arrived in the alleyway where Harry was? Had they been sent? Had the Ministry of Magic ANYMORE MAGIC lost control of the dementors, had the Ministry of Magic deserted Azkaban and joined Voldemort, as Dumbledore had predicted the Ministry of Magic would? ",
    "\"These demembers guard some weirdos' prison?\" said Vernon, lumbering in the wake of Harry's train of thought. ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Harry. ",
    "If only his head would stop hurting, if only he could just leave the kitchen and get to he dark bedroom and think... ",
    "\"Oho! They were coming to arrest you!\" said Vernon, with the triumphant air of a man reaching an unassailable conclusion. \"That's it, isn't it, boy? ",
    "You're on the run from the law!\" ",
    "\"Of course I'm not,\" said Harry, shaking His head as though to scare off a fly, Harry mind racing now. ",
    "\"Then why -- ?\" ",
    "\"Harry must have sent them,\" said Harry quietly, more to Harry than to Vernon. ",
    "\"What's that? Who must have sent them?\" ",
    "\"Lord Voldemort,\" said Harry. ",
    "Harry registered dimly how strange it was that the Dursleys, who flinched, winced, and squawked if they heard words like \"wizard,\" \"magic,\" or \"wand,\" could hear the name of the most evil wizard of all time without the slightest tremor. ",
    "\"Lord -- hang on,\" said Vernon, \"Lord face screwed up, a look of dawning comprehension in \"Lord piggy eyes. \"I've heard that name ... that was the one who ...\" ",
    "\"Murdered my parents, yes,Harry Harry said. ",
    "\"But \"Lord's gone,\" said Vernon impatiently, without the slightest sign that the murder of Harry's parents might be a painful topic to anybody. \"That giant bloke said so. That giant bloke's gone.\" ",
    "\"That giant bloke's back,\" said Harry heavily. ",
    "It felt very strange to be standing here in Aunt Petunia's surgically clean kitchen, beside the top-of- the-range fridge and the wide-screen television, and talking calmly of Lord Voldemort to Vernon. ",
    "The arrival of the dementors in Little Whinging seemed to have caused a breach in the great, invisible wall that divided the relentlessly non-magical world of Privet Drive and the world beyond. Harry's two lives had somehow become fused and everything had been turned upside down: the Dursleys were asking for details about the magical world and Mrs. Figg knew Albus Dumbledore; dementors were soaring around Little Whinging and Albus Dumbledore might never go back to Hogwarts. Harry's head throbbed more painfully. ",
    "\"Back?\" whispered Aunt Petunia. ",
    "Aunt Petunia was looking at Harry as Aunt Petunia had never looked at Harry before. And all of a sudden, for the very first time in Harry life, Harry fully appreciated that Aunt Petunia was Harry mother's sister. Harry could not have said why this hit Harry so very powerfully at this moment. All Harry knew was that Harry was not the only person in the room who had an inkling of what Lord Voldemort being back might mean. Aunt Petunia had never in Aunt Petunia life looked at Harry like that before. Aunt Petunia large, pale eyes (so unlike Aunt Petunia sister's) were not narrowed in dislike or anger: Her large, pale eyes were wide and fearful. The furious pretense that Aunt Petunia had maintained all Harry's life -- that there was no magic and no world other than the world Aunt Petunia inhabited with Vernon -- seemed to have fallen away. ",
    "\"Yes,\" Harry said, talking directly to Aunt Petunia now. \"Harry came back a month ago. I saw Harry.\" ",
    "Aunt Petunia hands found Dudley's massive leather-clad shoulders and clutched Dudley's massive leather-clad shoulders. ",
    "\"Hang on,\" said Vernon, looking from Vernon wife to Harry and back again, apparently dazed and confused by the unprecedented understanding that seemed to have sprung up between Dudley's massive leather-clad shoulders. \"Hang on. This Lord Voldything's back, you say.\" ",
    "\"Yes.\" ",
    "\"The one who murdered your parents.\" ",
    "\"Yes.\" ",
    "\"And now Harry's sending dismembers after you?\" ",
    "\"Looks like it,\" said Harry. ",
    "\"I see,\" said Vernon, looking from Vernon white- faced wife to Harry and hitching up Harry trousers. Harry seemed to be swelling, Harry great purple face stretching before Harry's eyes. \"Well, that settles it,\" Harry said, Harry shirt front straining as Harry inflated Harry, \"you can get out of this house, boy\\\" ",
    "\"What?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"You heard me -- OUT!\" Vernon bellowed, and even Aunt Petunia and Dudley jumped. \"OUT! OUT! I should've done it years ago! Owls treating the place like a rest home, puddings exploding, half the lounge destroyed, Dudley's tail, Marge bobbing around on the ceiling, and that flying Ford Anglia -- OUT! OUT! You've had flying Ford Anglia -- OUT! You're history! You're not staying here if some loony's after you, you're not endangering my wife and son, you're not bringing trouble down on us, if you're going the same way as your useless parents, I've had it! OUT!\" ",
    "Harry stood rooted to the spot. The letters from the Ministry, Mr. Weasley, and Sirius were crushed in Harry left hand. Don't leave this house again, whatever you do. DO NOT LEA VE YOUR A UNT AND UNCLE'S HOUSE. ",
    "\"You heard me!\" said Vernon, bending forward now, so that Vernon massive purple face came closer to Harry's, so that Harry actually felt flecks of spit hit his massive purple face. \"Get going! You were all keen to leave half an hour ago! I'm right behind you! Get out and never darken us doorstep again! Why us ever kept you in the first place I don't know. Marge was right, it should have been the orphanage, us were too damn soft for us own good, thought us could squash it out of you, thought us could turn you normal, but you've been rotten from the beginning, and I've had enough -- OWLS!\" ",
    "The fifth owl zoomed down the chimney so fast The fifth owl actually hit the floor before zooming into the air again with a loud screech. Harry raised Harry hand to seize the letter, which was in a scarlet envelope, but The fifth owl soared straight over Harry head, flying directly at Aunt Petunia, who let out a scream and ducked, her arms over her face. The fifth owl dropped a scarlet envelope on her , turned, and flew straight up the chimney again. ",
    "Harry darted forward to pick up this letter, but Aunt Petunia beat Harry to this letter. ",
    "\"You can open this letter if you like,\" said Harry, \"but I'll hear what this letter says anyway. That's a Howler.\" ",
    "\"Let go of it, Aunt Petunia!\" roared Vernon. \"Don't touch it, it could be dangerous!\" ",
    "\"It's addressed to me,\" said Aunt Petunia in a shaking voice. \"It's addressed to me, Vernon, look! Mrs. ",
    "Petunia Dursley, The Kitchen, Number Four, Privet Drive -- \" ",
    "Aunt Petunia caught Aunt Petunia breath, horrified. a scarlet envelope had begun to smoke. ",
    "\"Open a scarlet envelope!\" Harry urged Aunt Petunia. \"Get a scarlet envelope over with! a scarlet envelope'll happen anyway -- \" ",
    "\"No -- \" ",
    "Aunt Petunia's hand was trembling. Aunt Petunia looked wildly around the kitchen as though looking for an escape route, but too late -- a scarlet envelope burst into flames. Aunt Petunia screamed and dropped a scarlet envelope. ",
    "An awful voice filled the kitchen, echoing in the confined space, issuing from the burning letter on the table. ",
    "\"REMEMBER MY LAST, PETUNIA.\" ",
    "Aunt Petunia looked as though Aunt Petunia might faint. Aunt Petunia sank into the chair beside Dudley, Aunt Petunia face in Aunt Petunia hands. The remains of a scarlet envelope smoldered into ash in the silence. ",
    "\"What is this?\" Vernon said hoarsely. \"What -- ",
    "I don't -- Aunt Petunia?\" ",
    "Aunt Petunia said nothing. Dudley was staring stupidly at his mother, Dudley mouth hanging open. the silence spiraled horribly. Harry was watching Aunt Petunia, utterly bewildered, His head throbbing fit to burst. ",
    "\"Petunia, dear?\" said Vernon timidly. \"P- Petunia?\" ",
    "Vernon raised his head. Vernon was still trembling. Vernon swallowed. ",
    "\"The boy -- The boy -- will have to stay, Vernon,\" Vernon said weakly. ",
    "\"W-what?\" ",
    "\"Harry stays,\" Vernon said. Vernon was not looking at Harry. ",
    "Vernon got to Vernon feet again. ",
    "\"He ... but Petunia ...\" ",
    "\"If we throw He out, the neighbors will talk,\" Vernon said. Vernon was regaining Vernon usual brisk, snappish manner rapidly, though Vernon was still very pale. ",
    "\"They'll ask awkward questions, They'll want to know where He's gone. They'll have to keep He.\" ",
    "Vernon was deflating like an old tire. ",

    "Harry copied these words onto three separate pieces of parchment the moment Harry reached the desk in his dark bedroom. Harry addressed the first to Sirius, the second to Ron, and the third to Hermione. Harry owl, Hedwig, was off hunting; Hedwig cage stood empty on the desk. Harry paced his dark bedroom waiting for Hedwig to come back, Harry head pounding, Harry brain too busy for sleep even though Harry eyes stung and itched with tiredness. Harry back ached from carrying Dudley home, and the two lumps on his head where the window and Dudley had hit Harry were throbbing painfully. ",
    "Up and down Harry paced, consumed with anger and frustration, grinding Harry teeth and clenching Harry fists, casting angry looks out at the empty, star-strewn sky every time Harry passed the window. Dementors sent to get Harry, Mrs. Figg and Mundungus Fletcher tailing  ",
    "Harry in secret, then suspension from Hogwarts and a hearing at the Ministry of Magic -- and still no one was telling Harry what was going on. ",
    "And what, what, had that Howler been about? Whose voice had echoed so horribly, so menacingly, through the kitchen? ",
    "Why was Harry still trapped here without information? Why was everyone treating Harry like some naughty kid? Don't do any more magic, stay in this house... ",
    "Harry kicked Harry school trunk as Harry passed his school trunk, but far from relieving Harry anger Harry felt worse, as Harry now had a sharp pain in Harry toe to deal with in addition to a sharp pain in the rest of Harry body. ",
    "Just as Harry limped past the window, Hedwig soared through Just as he limped past the window with a soft rustle of wings like a small ghost. ",
    "\"About time!\" Harry snarled, as Hedwig landed lightly on top of Hedwig . \"You can put that down, IVe got work for you!\" ",
    "Hedwig's large round amber eyes gazed reproachfully at Harry over the dead frog clamped in Hedwig beak. ",
    "\"Come here,\" said Harry, picking up the three small rolls of parchment and a leather thong and tying the scrolls to Hedwig scaly leg. \"Take these straight to Sirius, Ron, and Hermione and don't come back here without good long replies. Keep pecking Ron, and Hermione till Ron, and Hermione've written decent-length answers if you've got to. Understand?\" ",
    "Hedwig gave a muffled hooting noise, beak still full of frog. ",
    "\"Get going, then,\" said Harry. ",
    "Hedwig took off immediately. The moment Hedwig'd gone, Harry threw Harry down onto Harry bed without undressing and stared at the dark ceiling. In addition to every other miserable feeling, Harry now felt guilty that Harry'd been irritable with Hedwig; Hedwig was the only friend Harry had at number four, Privet Drive. But Harry'd make it up to Hedwig when Hedwig came back with Sirius's, Ron's, and Hermione's answers. ",
    "They were bound to write back quickly; They couldn't possibly ignore a dementor attack. Harry'd probably wake up tomorrow to three fat letters full of sympathy and plans for Harry immediate removal to the Burrow. And with that comforting idea, sleep rolled over Harry, stifling all further thought. ",

    "But Hedwig didn't return next morning. Harry spent the day in his dark bedroom, leaving it only to go to the bathroom. Three times the day Aunt Petunia shoved food into Aunt Petunia room through the cat flap Vernon had installed three summers ago. Every time Harry heard Aunt Petunia approaching Harry tried to question Aunt Petunia about the Howler, but Harry might as well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers Harry got. Otherwise the Dursleys kept well clear of his dark bedroom. Harry couldn't see the point of forcing Harry company on them; another row would achieve nothing except perhaps making Harry so angry Harry'd perform more illegal magic. ",

    "leaving Harry to stew in this mess, and with a lethargy so complete that Harry could lie on his bed for an hour at a time, staring dazedly into space, aching with dread at the thought of the Ministry hearing. ",
    "What if they ruled against Harry? What if Harry was expelled and Harry wand was snapped in half? What would Harry do, where would Harry go? Harry could not return to living full-time with the Dursleys, not now that Harry knew the other world, the one to which Harry really belonged... Was it possible that Harry might be able to move into Sirius's house, as Sirius had suggested a year ago, before Harry had been forced to flee from the Ministry himself? Would Harry be allowed to live there alone, given that Harry was still underage? Or would the matter of where Harry went next be decided for Harry; had Harry breach of the International Statute of Secrecy been severe enough to land Harry in a cell in Azkaban? Whenever this thought occurred, Harry invariably slid off his bed and began pacing again. ",
    "On the fourth night after Hedwig's departure Harry was lying in one of Harry apathetic phases, staring at the dark ceiling, Harry exhausted mind quite blank, when Harry uncle entered his dark bedroom. Harry looked slowly around at Harry. Vernon was wearing Vernon best suit and an expression of enormous smugness. ",
    "\"We're going out,\" Harry said. ",
    "\"Sorry?\" ",

Harry heard the key turn in the lock and Vernon footsteps walking heavily down the stairs. A few minutes later Harry heard the slamming of car doors, the rumble of an engine, and the unmistakable sound of the car sweeping out of the drive. ",
    "Harry had no particular feeling about the Dursleys leaving. It made no difference to Harry whether they were in the house or not. Harry could not even summon the energy to get up and turn on Harry bedroom light. the room grew steadily darker around Harry as Harry lay listening to the night sounds through the window Harry kept open all the time, waiting for the blessed moment when Hedwig returned.

    "The empty house creaked around Harry. The pipes gurgled. Harry lay there in a kind of stupor, thinking of nothing, suspended in misery. ",
    "And then, quite distinctly, Harry heard a crash in the kitchen below. ",
    "Harry sat bolt upright, listening intently. the Dursleys couldn't be back, the Dursleys was much too soon, and in any case Harry hadn't heard their car. ",
    "There was silence for a few seconds, and then Harry heard voices. ",
    "Burglars, Harry thought, sliding off his bed onto Harry feet -- but a split second later it occurred to Harry that burglars would keep burglars voices down, and whoever was moving around in the kitchen below was certainly not troubling to do so. ",
    "Harry snatched up his wand from Harry bedside table and stood facing Harry bedroom door, listening with all Harry might. Next moment Harry jumped as the lock gave a loud click and his bedroom door swung open. ",

    "Harry heart shot upward into Harry throat. There were people standing in the shadowy hall below, silhouetted against the streetlight glowing through the glass door; eight or nine of people standing in the shadowy hall below, all, as far as Harry could see, looking up at Harry. ",
    "\"Lower your wand, boy, before you take someone's eye out,\" said a low, growling voice. ",
    "Harry's heart was thumping uncontrollably. Harry knew a low, growling voice, but Harry did not lower his wand. ",
    "\"Professor Moody?\" Harry said uncertainly. ",
    "\"I don't know so much about \"Professor Moody,' \" growled a low, growling voice, \"never got round to much teaching, did I? Get down here, we want to see you properly.\" ",
    "Harry lowered his wand slightly but did not relax Harry grip on it, nor did Harry move. Harry had very good reason to be suspicious. Harry had recently spent nine months in what Harry had thought was Mad-Eye Moody's company only to find out that it wasn't Moody at all, but an impostor; an impostor, moreover, who had tried to kill Harry before being unmasked. But before Harry could make a decision about what to do next, a second, slightly hoarse voice floated upstairs. ",

    "\"P-Professor Lupin?\" Harry said disbelievingly. \"Is that you?\" ",
    "\"Why are we all standing in the dark?\" said a third voice, this one completely unfamiliar, a woman's. \"Lumos.\" ",

    "Harry had a fleeting vision of Vernon face when Harry realized there was no All-England Best-Kept Suburban Lawn Competition. ",
    "\"We are leaving, aren't We?\" Harry asked. \"Soon?\" ",
    "\"Almost at once,\" said \"P-Professor Lupin, \"we're just waiting for the all-clear.\" ",
    "\"Where are we going? The Burrow?\" Harry asked hopefully. ",
    "\"Not the Burrow, no,\" said \"P-Professor Lupin, motioning Harry toward the kitchen; the little knot of wizards followed, all still eyeing Harry curiously. \"Too risky. We've set up headquarters somewhere undetectable. It's taken a while...\" ",
    "Mad-Eye Moody was now sitting at the kitchen table swigging from a hip flask, \" ",
    "Mad-Eye Moody magical eye spinning in all directions, taking in the Dursleys' many labor- saving appliances. ",
    "\"This is Alastor Moody, Harry,\" Lupin continued, pointing toward \" ",
    "Mad-Eye Moody. ",
    "\"Yeah, I know,\" said Harry uncomfortably; it felt odd to be introduced to somebody Harry'd thought Harry'd known for a year. ",
    "\"And this is Nymphadora -- \" ",
    "\" Don't call me Nymphadora, Remus,\" said the young witch with a shudder. \"It's Tonks.\" ",
    "\" -- Nymphadora Tonks, who prefers to be known by her surname only,\" finished \"P-Professor Lupin. ",
    "\"So would you if your fool of a mother had called you 'Nymphadora, ' \" muttered Tonks. ",
    "\"And this is Kingsley Shacklebolt\" -- Kingsley Shacklebolt indicated the tall black wizard, who bowed -- \"Elphias Doge\" -- the wheezy-voiced wizard nodded -- \"Dedalus Diggle -- \" ",
    "\"We've met before,\" squeaked the excitable Diggle, dropping Diggle top hat. ",
    "\" -- Emmeline Vance\" -- a stately looking witch in an emerald-green shawl inclined \" -- Emmeline Vance\" -- a stately looking witch in an emerald-green shawl head -- \"Sturgis Podmore\" -- a square-jawed wizard with thick, straw- colored hair winked -- \"and Hestia Jones.\" A pink- cheeked, black-haired witch waved from next to the toaster. ",
    "Harry inclined Harry head awkwardly at each of them as them were introduced. Harry wished them would look at something other than Harry; it was as though Harry had suddenly been ushered onstage. Harry also wondered why so many of them were there. ",
    "\"A surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you,\" said \"P-Professor Lupin, as though Harry had read Harry's mind; the corners of Harry mouth twitched slightly. ",
    "\"Yeah, well, the more the better,\" said Moody darkly. \"We're your guard, Potter.\" ",
    "\"We're just waiting for the signal to tell We it's safe to set off,\" said \"P-Professor Lupin, glancing out of the kitchen window. \"We've got about fifteen minutes.\" ",
    "\"Very clean, aren't they, these Muggles?\" said the witch called Tonks, who was looking around the kitchen with great interest. \"My dad's Muggle-born ",
    "and My dad's a right old slob. I suppose it varies, just like with wizards?\" ",
    "\"Er -- yeah,\" said Harry. \"Look\" -- My dad turned back to \"P-Professor Lupin -- \"what's going on, I haven't heard anything from anyone, what's Vol -- ?\" ",
    "Several of the witches and wizards made odd hissing noises; Dedalus Diggle dropped Dedalus Diggle hat again, and Moody's growled, \"Shut up\\\" ",
    "\"What?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"We're not discussing anything here, it's too risky,\" said Moody's, turning Moody's normal eye on Harry; his magical eye remained pointing up at the ceiling. \"Damn the ceiling,\" Moody's added angrily, putting a hand up to his magical eye, \"a hand keeps sticking -- ever since that scum wore a hand -- \" ",
    "And with a nasty squelching sound much like a plunger being pulled from a sink, Moody's popped out his magical eye. ",
    "\"Mad-Eye, you do know that's disgusting, don't you?\" said Tonks conversationally. ",
    "\"Get me a glass of water, would you, Harry?\" asked Moody's. ",
    "Harry crossed to the dishwasher, took out a clean glass, and filled a clean glass with water at a sink, still watched eagerly by the band of wizards. the band of wizards relentless staring was starting to annoy Harry. ",
    "\"Cheers,\" said Moody's, when Harry handed Harry a clean glass. Harry dropped the magical eyeball into water and prodded the magical eyeball up and down; his magical eye whizzed around, ",
    "staring at them all in turn. \"I want three-hundred- and-sixty degrees visibility on the return journey.\" ",
    "\"How're we getting -- wherever we're going?\" Harry asked. ",
    "\"Brooms,\" said \"P-Professor Lupin. \"Only way. You're too young to Apparate, they'll be watching the Floo Network, and it's more than they life's worth to set up an unauthorized Portkey.\" ",
    "\"Remus says you're a good flier,\" said Kingsley Shacklebolt in Kingsley Shacklebolt deep voice. ",
    "\"Kingsley Shacklebolt's excellent,\" said Lupin, who was checking Kingsley Shacklebolt watch. \"Anyway, you'd better go and get packed, Harry, they want to be ready to go when the signal comes.\" ",
    "\"I'll come and help you,\" said Tonks brightly. ",
    "Tonks followed Harry back into the hall and up the stairs, looking around with much curiosity and interest. ",
    "\"Funny place,\" Tonks said, \"it's a bit too clean, d'you know what I mean? Bit unnatural. Oh, this is better,\" Tonks added, as they entered Harry's bedroom and Harry turned on the light. ",
    "Harry room was certainly much messier than the rest of the house. Confined to His room for four days in a very bad mood, Harry had not bothered tidying up after Harry. Most of the books Harry owned were strewn over the floor where Harry'd tried to distract Harry with each in turn and thrown His room aside. Hedwig's cage needed cleaning out and was starting to smell, and Hedwig trunk lay open, revealing a jumbled mixture of Muggle ",
    "clothes and wizard's robes that had spilled onto the floor around the floor. ",
    "Harry started picking up books and throwing books hastily into his trunk. Tonks paused at Tonks open wardrobe to look critically at Tonks reflection in the mirror on the inside of the door. ",
    "\"You know, I don't think purple's really my color,\" Tonks said pensively, tugging at a lock of spiky hair. \"D'you think it makes me look a bit peaky?\" ",
    "\"Er -- \" said Harry, looking up at Tonks over the top of Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland. ",
    "\"Yeah, it does,\" said Tonks decisively. Tonks screwed up Tonks eyes in a strained expression as though Tonks were struggling to remember something. A second later, Tonks hair had turned bubble-gum pink. ",
    "\"How did you do that?\" said Harry, gaping at Tonks as Tonks opened her eyes again. ",
    "\"I'm a Metamorphmagus,\" Tonks said, looking back at Tonks reflection and turning Tonks head so that Tonks could see her hair from all directions. \"It means I can change my appearance at will,\" Tonks added, spotting Harry's puzzled expression in the mirror behind Tonks. ",
    "\"I was born one. I got top marks in Concealment and Disguise during Auror training without any study at all, it was great.\" ",
    "\"You're an Auror?\" said Harry, impressed. Being a Dark wizard catcher was the only career Harry'd ever considered after Hogwarts. ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Tonks, looking proud. \"Kingsley is as well; Kingsley's a bit higher up than I am, though. I only qualified a year ago. Nearly failed on Stealth and ",
    "Tracking, I'm dead clumsy, did you hear me break that plate when we arrived downstairs?\" ",
    "\"Can you learn how to be a Metamorphmagus?\" Harry asked Harry, straightening up, completely forgetting about packing. ",
    "Tonks chuckled. ",
    "\"Bet you wouldn't mind hiding that scar sometimes, eh?\" ",
    "her eyes found the lightning-shaped scar on Harry's forehead. ",
    "\"No, I wouldn't mind,Harry Harry mumbled, turning away. Harry did not like people staring at the lightning-shaped scar on Harry's forehead. ",
    "\"Well, you 11 have to learn the hard way, I'm afraid,\" said Tonks. \"Metamorphmagi are really rare, Metamorphmagi're born, not made. Most wizards need to use a wand or potions to change Most wizards appearance... But we've got to get going, Harry, we're supposed to be packing,\" she added guiltily, looking around at all the mess on the floor. ",
    "\"Oh -- yeah,\" said Harry, grabbing up a few more books. ",
    "\"Don't be stupid, it'll be much quicker if I -- pack).\" cried Tonks, waving she wand in a long, sweeping movement over the floor. ",
    "Books, clothes, telescope, and scales all soared into the air and flew pell-mell into the trunk. ",
    "\"It's not very neat,\" said Tonks, walking over to the trunk and looking down at the jumble inside. \"My mum's got this knack of getting stuff to fit itself in ",
    "neatly -- My mum even gets the socks to fold the socks -- but I've never mastered how My mum does the socks -- the socks's a kind of flick -- \" ",
    "My mum flicked My mum hopefully; one of Harry's socks gave a feeble sort of wiggle and flopped back on top of the mess within. ",
    "\"Ah, well,\" said Tonks, slamming the trunk's lid shut, \"at least it's all in. That could do with a bit of cleaning, too -- Scourgify -- \" My mum pointed My mum at Hedwig's cage; a few feathers and droppings vanished. \"Well, that's a bit better -- I've never quite got the hang of these sort of householdy spells. Right -- got everything? Cauldron? Broom? Wow! A Firebolt?\" ",
    "A Firebolt?\" ",
    " eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in Harry's right hand. It was his pride and joy, a gift from Sirius, an international standard broomstick. ",
    "\"And I'm still riding a Comet Two Sixty,\" said Tonks enviously. \"Ah well ... wand still in your jeans? Both buttocks still on? Okay, let's go. Locomotor Trunk.\" ",
    "Locomotor Trunk rose a few inches into the air. Holding Locomotor Trunk like a conductor's baton, Tonks made it hover across the room and out of the door ahead of them, Hedwig's cage in Hedwig left hand. Harry followed Hedwig down the stairs carrying Harry broomstick. ",
    "Back in the kitchen, Moody's had replaced Harry eye, which was spinning so fast after its cleaning it made Harry feel sick. Kingsley Shacklebolt and Sturgis Podmore were examining the microwave and Hestia Jones was laughing at a potato peeler Hestia Jones had come across while rummaging in the drawers. \"P-Professor Lupin was sealing a letter addressed to the Dursleys. ",
    "\"Excellent,\" said \"P-Professor Lupin, looking up as Tonks and Harry entered. \"We've got about a minute, I think. We should probably get out into the garden so We're ready. Harry, I've left a letter telling your aunt and uncle not to worry -- \" ",
    "\"your aunt and uncle won't,\" said Harry. ",
    "\"That you're safe -- \" ",
    "\"That'll just depress your aunt and uncle.\" ",
    "\" -- and you'll see your aunt and uncle next summer.\" ",
    "\"Do I have to?\" ",
    "Lupin smiled but made no answer. ",
    "\"Come here, boy,\" said Moody gruffly, beckoning Harry toward him with him . \"I need to Disillusion you.\" ",
    "\"You need to what?\" said Harry nervously. ",
    "\"Disillusionment Charm,\" said Moody's, raising her wand. \"\"P-Professor Lupin says you've got an Invisibility Cloak, but \"P-Professor Lupin won't stay on while we're flying; this'll disguise you better. Here you go -- \" ",
    "\"P-Professor Lupin rapped Harry hard on the top of the head and Harry felt a curious sensation as though Moody's had just smashed an egg there; cold trickles seemed to be running down \"P-Professor Lupin body from the point her wand had struck. ",
    "\"Nice one, Mad-Eye,\" said Tonks appreciatively, staring at Harry's midriff. ",
    "Harry looked down at his body, or rather, what had been his body, for his body didn't look anything like Harry anymore. It was not invisible; It had simply taken on the exact color and texture of the kitchen unit behind Harry. Harry seemed to have become a human chameleon. ",
    "\"Come on,\" said Moody's, unlocking the back door with her wand. ",
    "They all stepped outside onto Uncle Vernon's beautifully kept lawn. ",
    "\"Clear night,\" grunted Moody's, Harry magical eye scanning the heavens. \"Could've done with a bit more cloud cover. Right, you,\" Harry barked at Harry, \"we're going to be flying in close formation. Tonks'll be right in front of you, keep close on her tail. Lupin'll be covering you from below. I'm going to be behind you. The rest'll be circling us. us don't break ranks for anything, got me? If one of us is killed -- \" ",
    "\"Is that likely?\" Harry asked apprehensively, but Moody's ignored Harry. ",
    "\" -- the others keep flying, don't stop, don't break ranks. If the others take out all of us and you survive, ",
    "Harry, the rear guard are standing by to take over; keep flying east and the others'll join you.\" ",
    "\"Stop being so cheerful, Mad-Eye, Harry'll think us're not taking this seriously,\" said Tonks, as she strapped Harry's trunk and Hedwig's cage into a harness hanging from she broom. ",
    "\"I'm just telling the boy the plan,\" growled Moody's. \"us job's to deliver the boy safely to headquarters and if us die in the attempt -- \" ",
    "\"No one's going to die,\" said Kingsley Shacklebolt in Kingsley Shacklebolt deep, calming voice. ",
    "\"Mount your brooms, that's the first signal!\" said \"P-Professor Lupin sharply, pointing into the sky. ",
    "Far, far above them, a shower of bright red sparks had flared among the stars. Harry recognized the stars at once as wand sparks. Harry swung Harry right leg over Harry Firebolt, gripped his Firebolt handle tightly, and felt his Firebolt vibrating very slightly, as though his Firebolt was as keen as Harry was to be up in the air once more. ",
    "\"Second signal, let's go!\" said \"P-Professor Lupin loudly, as more sparks, green this time, exploded high above them. ",
    "Harry kicked off hard from the ground. The cool night air rushed through Harry hair as the neat square gardens of Privet Drive fell away, shrinking rapidly into a patchwork of dark greens and blacks, and every thought of the Ministry hearing was swept from Harry mind as though the rush of air had blown the rush of air out of Harry head. Harry felt as though Harry heart was going to explode with pleasure; Harry was flying again, flying away from Privet Drive as Harry'd been fantasizing about all summer, Harry was going home... For a few glorious moments, all Harry problems seemed to recede into nothing, insignificant in the vast, starry sky. ",
    "\"Hard left, hard left, there's a Muggle looking up!\" shouted Moody's from behind Moody's. Tonks swerved and Harry followed Tonks, watching Tonks trunk swinging wildly beneath Tonks broom. \"We need more height... Give it another quarter of a mile!\" ",
    "Harry's eyes watered in the chill as they soared upward; Harry could see nothing below now but tiny pinpricks of light that were car headlights and streetlamps. Two of those tiny lights might belong to ",
    "Uncle Vernon's car... the Dursleys would be heading back to their empty house right now, full of rage about the nonexistent lawn competition . . . and Harry laughed aloud at the thought, though Harry voice was drowned by the flapping of the others' robes, the creaking of the harness holding Harry trunk and the cage, the whoosh of the wind in the others' ears as the others' sped through the air. Harry had not felt this alive in a month, or this happy... ",
    "\"Bearing south!\" shouted Mad-Eye. \"Town ahead!\" ",
    "the others' soared right, so that the others' did not pass directly over the glittering spiderweb of lights below. ",
    "\"Bear southeast and keep climbing, there's some low cloud ahead we can lose we in!\" called Moody. ",
    "\"we're not going through clouds!\" shouted Tonks angrily. \"we'll get soaked, Mad-Eye!\" ",
    "Harry was relieved to hear \" ",
    "Harry say this; Harry hands were growing numb on the Firebolt's handle. Harry wished Harry had thought to put on a coat; Harry was starting to shiver. ",
    "They altered They course every now and then according to Mad-Eye 's instructions. Harry's eyes were screwed up against the rush of icy wind that was starting to make Harry ears ache. Harry could remember being this cold on a broom only once before, during the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff in Harry third year, which had taken place in a storm. The guard around Harry was circling continuously like giant birds of prey. Harry lost track of time. Harry wondered how long they had been flying; it felt like an hour at least. ",
    "\"Turning southwest!\" yelled Moody's. \"We want to avoid the motorway!\" ",
    "Harry was now so chilled that Harry thought longingly for a moment of the snug, dry interiors of the cars streaming along below, then, even more longingly, of traveling by Floo powder; it might be uncomfortable to spin around in fireplaces but it was at least warm in the flames... Kingsley Shacklebolt swooped around Harry, bald pate and earring gleaming slightly in the moonlight... Now Emmeline Vance was on Kingsley Shacklebolt right, Emmeline Vance wand out, Emmeline Vance head turning left and right . . . then Emmeline Vance too swooped over Harry, to be replaced by Sturgis Podmore... ",
    "\"We ought to double back for a bit, just to make sure We're not being followed!\" Moody's shouted. ",
    "\"ARE YOU MAD, MAD-EYE?\" Tonks screamed from the front. \"We're all frozen to We brooms! If We keep going off course We're not going to get there until next week! We're nearly there now!\" ",
    "\"Time to start the descent!\" came Lupin's voice. \"Follow Tonks, Harry!\" ",
    "Harry followed Tonks into a dive. Follow Tonks, Harry!\" ",
    "Harry were heading for the largest collection of lights Harry had yet seen, a huge, sprawling, crisscrossing mass, glittering in lines and grids, interspersed with patches of deepest black. Lower and lower Follow Tonks, Harry!\" ",
    "Harry flew, until Harry could see individual headlights and streetlamps, chimneys, and television aerials. Harry wanted to reach the ground very much, though Harry felt sure that someone would have to unfreeze Harry from someone broom. ",
    "\"Here we go!\" called Tonks, and a few seconds later Tonks had landed. ",
    "Harry touched down right behind Tonks and dismounted on a patch of unkempt grass in the middle of a small square. Tonks was already unbuckling Harry's trunk. Shivering, Harry looked around. The grimy fronts of the surrounding houses were not welcoming; some of The grimy fronts of the surrounding houses had broken windows, glimmering dully in the light from the street-lamps, paint was peeling from many of the doors, and heaps of rubbish lay outside several sets of front steps. ",
    "\"Where are we?\" Harry asked, but \"P-Professor Lupin said quietly, \"In a minute.\" ",
    "Moody was rummaging in Harry cloak, Harry gnarled hands clumsy with cold. ",
    "\"Got his gnarled hands,\" Harry muttered, raising what looked like a silver cigarette lighter into the air and clicking a silver cigarette lighter into the air. ",
    "The nearest streetlamp went out with a pop. The nearest streetlamp clicked the un-lighter again; the next lamp went out. The nearest streetlamp kept clicking until every lamp in the square was extinguished and the only light in the square came from curtained windows and the sickle moon overhead. ",
    "\"Borrowed it from Dumbledore,\" growled Moody's, pocketing the Put-Outer. \"That'll take care of any Muggles looking out of the window, see? Now, come on, quick.\" ",
    "The nearest streetlamp took Harry by the arm and led Harry from the patch of grass, across the road, and onto the pavement. \"P-Professor Lupin and Tonks followed, carrying Harry's trunk between Lupin and Tonks, the rest of the guard, all with Lupin and Tonks wands out, flanking Lupin and Tonks. ",
    "The muffled pounding of a stereo was coming from an upper window in the nearest house. A pungent smell of rotting rubbish came from the pile of bulging bin- bags just inside the broken gate. ",
    "\"Here,\" Moody's muttered, thrusting a piece of parchment toward Harry's Disillusioned hand and holding Harry lit wand close to a piece of parchment toward Harry's Disillusioned hand, so as to illuminate the writing. \"Read quickly and memorize.\" ",
    "Harry looked down at a piece of parchment toward Harry's Disillusioned hand. The narrow handwriting was vaguely familiar. The narrow handwriting said: ",
    "The headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may Harry found at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London. "
  ],
  "NUMBER TWELVE, GRIMMAULD PLACE": [
    "\"What's the Order of the -- ?Harry Harry began. ",
    "\"Not here, boy!\" snarled Moody's. \"Wait till we're inside!\" ",
    "Harry pulled a piece of parchment toward Harry's Disillusioned hand out of Harry's hand and set fire to a piece of parchment toward Harry's Disillusioned hand with Harry wand tip. As the message curled into flames and floated to the ground, Harry looked around at the surrounding houses again. the surrounding houses were standing outside number eleven; Harry looked to the left and saw number ten; to the right, however, was number thirteen. ",
    "\"But where's -- ?\" ",
    "\"Think about what you've just memorized,\" said \"P-Professor Lupin quietly. ",
    "Harry thought, and no sooner had Harry reached the part about number twelve, Grimmauld Place, than a ",
    "battered door emerged out of nowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen, followed swiftly by dirty walls and grimy windows. It was as though an extra house had inflated, pushing those on either side out of either side way. Harry gaped at It. The stereo in number eleven thudded on. Apparently Muggles hadn't even felt anything. ",
    "\"Come on, hurry,\" growled Moody's, prodding Harry in the back. ",
    "Harry walked up the worn stone steps, staring at the newly materialized door. the newly materialized door black paint was shabby and scratched. The silver door knocker was in the form of a twisted serpent. There was no keyhole or letterbox. ",
    "\"P-Professor Lupin pulled out his lit wand and tapped the newly materialized door once. Harry heard many loud, metallic clicks and what sounded like the clatter of a chain. the newly materialized door creaked open. ",
    "\"Get in quick, Harry,\" \"P-Professor Lupin whispered. \"But don't go far inside and don't touch anything.\" ",
    "Harry stepped over the threshold into the almost total darkness of the hall. Harry could smell damp, dust, and a sweetish, rotting smell; the place had the feeling of a derelict building. Harry looked over Harry shoulder and saw the others filing in behind Harry, Lupin and Tonks carrying Harry trunk and Hedwig's cage. Moody's was standing on the top step and releasing the balls of light the Put-Outer had stolen from the street-lamps; they flew back to they bulbs and the square beyond glowed momentarily with orange light before Moody's limped inside and closed the front door, so that the darkness in the hall became complete. ",
    "\"Here -- \" ",
    "He rapped Harry hard over his head with He ; Harry felt as though something hot was trickling down Harry back this time and knew that the Disillusionment Charm must have lifted. ",
    "\"Now stay still, everyone, while I give us a bit of light in here,Moody's whispered. ",
    "The others' hushed voices were giving Harry an odd feeling of foreboding; it was as though The others' hushed voices had just entered the house of a dying person. Harry heard a soft hissing noise and then old-fashioned gas lamps sputtered into life all along the walls, casting a flickering insubstantial light over the peeling wallpaper and threadbare carpet of a long, gloomy hallway, where a cobwebby chandelier glimmered overhead and age-blackened portraits hung crooked on the walls. Harry heard something scuttling behind the baseboard. Both the chandelier and the candelabra on a rickety table nearby were shaped like serpents. ",
    "There were hurried footsteps and Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley, emerged from a door at the far end of the hall. Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley was beaming in welcome as Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley hurried toward Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley, though Harry noticed that Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley was rather thinner and paler than Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley had been last time Harry had seen Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley. ",
    "\"Oh, Harry, it's lovely to see you!\" Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley whispered, pulling Harry into a rib-cracking hug before holding Harry at arm's length and examining Harry critically. \"You're looking peaky; you need feeding up, but you'll have to wait a bit for dinner, I'm afraid...\" ",
    "Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley turned to the gang of wizards behind Harry and whispered urgently, \"Harry's just arrived, the meeting's started...\" ",
    "wizards made noises of interest and excitement and began filing past Harry toward the door through which Mrs. Weasley had just come; Harry made to follow \"P-Professor Lupin, but Mrs. Weasley held Mrs. Weasley back. ",
    "\"No, Harry, the meeting's only for members of the Order. Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley are upstairs, you can wait with Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley until the meeting's over and then Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley'll have dinner. And keep your voice down in the hall,\" Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley added in an urgent whisper. ",
    "\"Why?\" ",
    "\"I don't want to wake anything up.\" ",
    "\"What d'you -- ?\" ",

    "Pressing Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley finger to Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley lips, Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley led Mrs. Weasley on tiptoes past a pair of long, moth-eaten curtains, behind which Harry supposed there must be another door, and after skirting a large umbrella stand that looked as though it had been made from a severed troll's leg, Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley started up the dark staircase, passing a row of shrunken heads mounted on plaques on the wall. A closer look showed Harry that shrunken heads belonged to house-elves. All of the heads belonged to house-elves had the same rather snoutlike nose. ",
    "Harry's bewilderment deepened with every step Harry took. What on earth were Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley doing in a house that looked as though it belonged to the Darkest of wizards? ",
    "\"Mrs. Weasley, why -- ?\" ",
    "\"Ron and Hermione will explain everything, dear, I've really got to dash,\" Mrs. Weasley whispered distractedly. \"There\" -- Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley had reached the second landing -- \"you're the door on the right. I'll call you when it's over.\" ",
    "And Mrs. Weasley hurried off downstairs again. ",
    "Harry crossed the second landing, turned the bedroom doorknob, which was shaped like a serpent's head, and opened the door. ",
    "Harry caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy high-ceilinged, twin-bedded room, then there was a loud twittering noise, followed by an even louder shriek, and Harry vision was completely obscured by a large quantity of very bushy hair -- Hermione had thrown Hermione onto Harry in a hug that nearly knocked Harry flat, while Ron's tiny owl, Pigwidgeon, zoomed excitedly round and round Ron's tiny owl, Pigwidgeon heads.

    "\"HARRY! Ron, Ron's here, Harry's here! We didn't hear you arrive! Oh, how are you? Are you all right? Have you been furious with We? I bet you have, I know We letters were useless -- but We couldn't tell you anything, Dumbledore made We swear We wouldn't, oh, We've got so much to tell you, and you've got to tell We -- the dementors! When We heard -- and that Ministry hearing -- it's just outrageous, I've looked it all up, they can't expel you, they just can't, there's provision in the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Sorcery for the use of magic in life- threatening situations -- \" ",
    "\"Let him breathe, Hermione,\" said Ron, grinning, closing the door behind Harry. him seemed to have grown several more inches during their month apart, making him taller and more gangly looking than ever, ",
    "though the long nose, bright red hair, and freckles were the same. ",
    "Hermione, still beaming, let go of Harry, but before Harry could say another word there was a soft whooshing sound and something white soared from the top of a dark wardrobe and landed gently on Harry's shoulder. ",
    "\"Hedwig!\" ",
    "The snowy owl clicked Harry beak and nibbled The snowy owl ear affectionately as Harry stroked Harry feathers. ",
    "\"Harry's been in a right state,\" said Ron. \"Pecked us half to death when Harry brought your last letters, look at this -- \" ",
    "Ron showed Harry the index finger of Ron right hand, which sported a half-healed but clearly deep cut. ",
    "\"Oh yeah,\" Harry said. \"Sorry about that, but I wanted answers, you know...\" ",
    "\"We wanted to give answers to you, mate,\" said Ron. \"Hermione was going spare, Hermione kept saying you'd do something stupid if you were stuck all on your own without news, but Dumbledore made us -- \" ",
    "\" -- swear not to tell me,\" said Harry. \"Yeah, Hermione's already said.\" ",
    "The warm glow that had flared inside Harry at the sight of Harry two best friends was extinguished as something icy flooded the pit of Harry stomach. All of a sudden -- after yearning to see All of a sudden for a solid month -- Harry felt Harry would rather Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley left Harry alone. ",
    "There was a strained silence in which Harry stroked Hedwig automatically, not looking at either of the others. ",
    "\"Harry seemed to think it was best,\" said Hermione rather breathlessly. \"Dumbledore, I mean.\" ",
    "\"Right,\" said Harry. Harry noticed that Hermione hands too bore the marks of Hedwig's beak and found that Harry was not at all sorry. ",
    "\"I think Harry thought you were safest with Muggles -- \" Ron began. ",
    "\"Yeah?\" said Harry, raising Harry eyebrows. \"Have either of you been attacked by dementors this summer?\" ",
    "\"Well, no -- but that's why Harry's had people from the Order of the Phoenix tailing you all the time -- \" ",
    "Harry felt a great jolt in Harry guts as though Harry had just missed a step going downstairs. So everyone had known Harry was being followed except Harry. ",
    "\"Didn't work that well, though, did it?\" said Harry, doing Harry utmost to keep Harry voice even. \"Had to look after Harry after all, didn't I?\" ",
    "\"Harry was so angry,\" said Hermione in an almost awestruck voice. \"Dumbledore. We saw Dumbledore. When Dumbledore found out Mundungus had left before Dumbledore shift had ended. Dumbledore was scary.\" ",
    "\"Well, I'm glad Dumbledore left,\" Harry said coldly. \"If Dumbledore hadn't, I wouldn't have done Magic and Dumbledore would probably have left me at Privet Drive all summer.\" ",
    "\"Aren't you ... aren't you worried about the Ministry of Magic hearing?\" said Hermione quietly. ",
    "\"No,\" Harry lied defiantly. Harry walked away from them, looking around, with Hedwig nestled contentedly on his shoulder, but this room was not likely to raise Harry spirits. this room was dank and dark. A blank stretch of canvas in an ornate picture frame was all that relieved the bareness of the peeling walls and as Harry passed it Harry thought Harry heard someone lurking out of sight snigger. ",
    "\"So why's Dumbledore been so keen to keep me in the dark?\" Harry asked, still trying hard to keep his voice casual. \"Did you -- er -- bother to ask Harry at all?\" ",
    "Harry glanced up just in time to see them exchanging a look that told Harry Harry was behaving just as them had feared Harry would. It did nothing to improve Harry temper. ",
    "\"We told Dumbledore We wanted to tell you what was going on,\" said Ron. \"We did, mate. But Dumbledore's really busy now, We've only seen Dumbledore twice since We came here and Dumbledore didn't have much time, Dumbledore just made We swear not to tell you important stuff when We wrote, Dumbledore said the owls might be intercepted -- \" ",
    "\"Dumbledore could still've kept me informed if Dumbledore'd wanted to,Harry Harry said shortly. \"You're not telling me Dumbledore doesn't know ways to send messages without owls.\" ",
    "Hermione glanced at Ron and then said, \"I thought that too. But Dumbledore didn't want you to know anything.\" ",
    "\"Maybe Dumbledore thinks I can't be trusted,\" said Harry, watching their expressions. ",
    "\"Don't be thick,\" said Ron, looking highly disconcerted. ",
    "\"Or that I can't take care of Ron -- \" ",
    "\"Of course Dumbledore doesn't think that!\" said Hermione anxiously. ",
    "\"So how come I have to stay at the Dursleys' while you two get to join in everything that's going on here?\" said Harry, the words tumbling over one another in a rush, his voice growing louder with every word. \"How come you two are allowed to know everything that's going on -- ?\" ",
    "\"We're not!\" Ron interrupted. \"Mum won't let We near THE MEETINGS, Mum says We're too young -- \" ",
    "But before Ron knew it, Harry was shouting. ",
    "\"SO YOU HAVEN'T BEEN IN THE MEETINGS, BIG DEAL! YOUVE STILL BEEN HERE, HAVEN T YOU? YOUVE STILL BEEN TOGETHER! ME, IVE BEEN STUCK AT the Dursleys' FOR A MONTH! AND ME HANDLED MORE THAN YOU TWOVE EVER MANAGED AND Dumbledore KNOWS IT -- WHO SAVED THE SORCERER'S STONE? WHO GOT RID OF RIDDLE? WHO SAVED BOTH YOUR SKINS FROM THE DEMENTORS?\" ",
    "Every bitter and resentful thought that Harry had had in the past month was pouring out of Harry; Harry frustration at the lack of news, the hurt that they had all been together without Harry, Harry fury at being followed and not told about it: All the feelings Harry was half-ashamed of finally burst they boundaries. ",
    "Hedwig took fright at the noise and soared off on top of the wardrobe again; Pigwidgeon twittered in alarm and zoomed even faster around their heads. ",
    "\"WHO HAD TO GET PAST DRAGONS AND SPHINXES AND EVERY OTHER FOUL THING LAST YEAR? WHO ",
    "SAW HIM COME BACK? WHO HAD TO ESCAPE FROM SAW HIM? ME!\" ",
    "Ron was standing there with Ron mouth half-open, clearly stunned and at a loss for anything to say, while Hermione looked on the verge of tears. ",
    "\"BUT WHY SHOULD I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON? WHY SHOULD ANYONE BOTHER TO TELL ME WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING?\" ",
    "\" ",
    "Harry, we wanted to tell you, we really did -- Hermione began. ",
    "\"CANTVE WANTED TO THAT MUCH, CAN YOU, OR YOU'D HAVE SENT ME AN OWL, BUT DUMBLEDORE MADE YOU SWEAR -- \" ",
    "\"Well, he did -- \" ",
    "\"FOUR WEEKS IVE BEEN STUCK IN PRIVET DRIVE, NICKING PAPERS OUT OF BINS TO TRY AND FIND OUT WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON -- \" ",
    "\"We wanted to -- \" ",
    "\"I SUPPOSE YOUVE BEEN HAVING A REAL LAUGH, HAVENT YOU, ALL HOLED UP HERE TOGETHER -- \" ",
    "\"No, honest -- \" ",
    "\"Harry, We're really sorry!\" said Hermione desperately, Hermione eyes now sparkling with tears. \"You're absolutely right, Harry -- I'd be furious if it was me!\" ",
    "Harry glared at Hermione, still breathing deeply, then turned away from them again, pacing up and down. Hedwig hooted glumly from the top of the wardrobe. ",
    "There was a long pause, broken only by the mournful creak of the floorboards below Harry's feet. ",
    "\"What is this place anyway?\" Harry shot at Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley. ",
    "\"Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix,\" said Ron at once. ",
    "\"Is anyone going to bother telling me what the Order of the Phoenix -- ?\" ",
    "\"It's a secret society,\" said Hermione quickly. \"Dumbledore's in charge, Dumbledore founded It. It's the people who fought against You-Know-Who last time.\" ",
    "\"Who's in It?\" said Harry, coming to a halt with Harry hands in Harry pockets. ",
    "\"Quite a few people -- \" ",
    "\" -- we've met about twenty of \"Quite a few people -- \" ",
    ",\" said Ron, \"but we think there are more...\" ",
    "Harry glared at \"Quite a few people -- \" ",
    ". ",
    "\" Well?\" \" ",
    "Harry demanded, looking from one to the other. \"Er,\" said Ron. \"Well what?\" ",
    "\"Voldemorti\" said Harry furiously, and both Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley Hermione winced. \"What's happening? What's \" ",
    "Harry up to? Where is \" ",
    "Harry? What are we doing to stop \" ",
    "Harry?\" ",
    "\"we've told you, the Order don't let we in on the Order meetings,\" said Hermione nervously. \"So we don't know the details -- but we've got a general idea -- \" she added hastily, seeing the look on Harry's face. ",
    "\"Fred and George have invented Extendable Ears, see,\" said Ron. \"\"Fred and George're really useful.\" ",
    "\"Extendable -- ?\" ",
    "\"Ears, yeah. Only we've had to stop using \"Fred and George lately because Mum found out and went berserk. Fred George had to hide \"Fred and George to stop Mum binning \"Fred and George. But \"Fred and George got a good bit of use out of \"Fred and George before Mum realized what was going on. We know some of the Order are following known Death Eaters, keeping tabs on known Death Eaters, you know -- \" ",
    "\" -- some of known Death Eaters are working on recruiting more people to the Order -- \" said Hermione. ",
    "\" -- and some of known Death Eaters are standing guard over something,\" said Ron. \"known Death Eaters're always talking about guard duty.\" ",
    "\"Couldn't have been me, could it?\" said Harry sarcastically. ",
    "\"Oh yeah,\" said Ron, with a look of dawning comprehension. ",
    "Harry snorted. Harry walked around this room again, looking anywhere but at Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley. \"So what have you two been doing, if you're not allowed in meetings?\" Harry demanded. \"You said you'd been busy.\" ",
    "\"Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley have,\" said Hermione quickly. \"Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley've been decontaminating this house, this house's been empty for ages and stuff's been breeding in here. Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley've managed to clean out the kitchen, most of the bedrooms, and I think Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley're doing the drawing room tomo -- AARGH!\" ",
    "With two loud cracks, Fred and George, Ron's elder twin brothers, had materialized out of thin air in the ",
    "middle of this room. Pigwidgeon twittered more wildly than ever and zoomed off to join Hedwig on top of the wardrobe. ",
    "\"Stop doing that!\" Hermione said weakly to the twins, who were as vividly red-haired as Ron, though stockier and slightly shorter. ",
    "\"Hello, Harry,\" said George, beaming at Harry. \"Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley thought Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley heard your dulcet tones.\" ",
    "\"You don't want to bottle up your anger like that, Harry, let it all out,\" said Fred, also beaming. \"There might be a couple of people fifty miles away who didn't hear you.\" ",
    "\"You two passed your Apparation tests, then?\" asked Harry grumpily. ",
    "\"With distinction,\" said Fred, who was holding what looked like a piece of very long, flesh-colored string. ",
    "\"It would have taken you about thirty seconds longer to walk down the stairs,\" said Ron. ",
    "\"Time is Galleons, little brother,\" said Fred. \"Anyway, Harry, you're interfering with reception. Extendable Ears,\" Harry added in response to Harry's raised eyebrows, holding up the string, which Harry now saw was trailing out onto the landing. \"Ron's mother, Mrs. Weasley're trying to hear what's going on downstairs.\" ",
    "\"You want to be careful,\" said Ron, staring at the ear. \"If Mum sees one of them again ...\" ",
    "\"It's worth the risk, that's a major meeting them're having,\" said Fred. ",
    "The door opened and a long mane of red hair appeared. ",
    "\"Oh hello, Harry!\" said Ron's younger sister, Ginny, brightly. \"I thought I heard your voice.\" ",
    "Turning to Fred George she said, \"It's no go with the Extendable Ears, she's gone and put an Imperturbable Charm on The door.\" ",
    "\"How d'you know?\" said George, looking crestfallen. ",
    "\"Tonks told me how to find out,\" said Ginny. \"You just chuck stuff at The door and if The door can't make contact The door's been Imperturbed. I've been flicking Dungbombs at Dungbombs from the top of the stairs and they just soar away from Dungbombs, so there's no way the Extendable Ears will be able to get under the gap.\" ",
    "Fred heaved a deep sigh. \"Shame. I really fancied finding out what old Snape's been up to.\" ",
    "\"Snape?\" said Harry quickly. \"Is Harry here?\" ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said George, carefully closing The door and sitting down on one of the beds; Fred and Ginny followed. \"Giving a report. Top secret.\" ",
    "\"Git,\" said \" ",
    "Fred. ",
    "\"Harry's on our side now,\" said Hermione reprovingly. ",
    "Ron snorted. \"Doesn't stop Harry being a git. The way Harry looks at our when Harry sees our...\" ",
    "\"Bill doesn't like Harry either,\" said Ginny, as though that settled the matter. ",
    "Harry was not sure Harry anger had abated yet; but Harry thirst for information was now overcoming Harry urge to keep shouting. Harry sank onto the bed opposite the others. ",
    "\"Is Bill here?\" Harry asked. \"I thought Harry was working in Egypt.\" ",
    "\"Harry applied for a desk job so Harry could come home and work for the Order,\" said Fred. \"Harry says Harry misses the tombs, but,\" Harry smirked, \"there are compensations...\" ",
    "\"What d'you mean?\" ",
    "\"Remember old Fleur Delacour?\" said George. \"She's got a job at Gringotts to eemprove 'er Eeenglish -- \" ",
    "\" -- and Bill's been giving She a lot of private lessons,\" sniggered Fred. ",
    "\"Charlie's in the Order too,\" said George, \"but George's still in Romania, Dumbledore wants as many foreign wizards brought in as possible, so \"Charlie's trying to make contacts on \"Charlie days off.\" ",
    "\"Couldn't Percy do that?\" Harry asked. The last Percy had heard, Mr. Weasley was working in the Department of International Magical Cooperation at the Ministry of Magic. ",
    "At these words all the Weasleys and Hermione exchanged darkly significant looks. ",
    "\"Whatever you do, don't mention Percy in front of Mum and Dad,Ron Ron told Harry in a tense voice. ",
    "\"Why not?\" ",
    "\"Because every time Percy's name's mentioned, Dad breaks whatever Mr. Weasley's holding and Mum starts crying,\" ",
    "Fred said. ",
    "\"It's been awful,\" said Ginny sadly. ",
    "\"I think we're well shut of Mr. Weasley,\" said George with an uncharacteristically ugly look on George face. ",
    "\"What's happened?\" Harry said. ",
    "Percy had a row,\" said Fred. \"I've never seen Dad row with anyone like that. It's normally Mum who shouts...\" ",
    "\"It was the first week back after term ended,\" said Ron. \"we were about to come and join the Order. Percy came home and told we Percy'd been promoted.\" ",
    "\"You're kidding?\" said Harry. ",
    "Though Percy knew perfectly well that Percy was highly ambitious, Harry's impression was that Percy had not made a great success of Percy first job at the Ministry of MagicMagic. Percy had committed the fairly large oversight of failing to notice that Percy boss was being controlled by Lord Voldemort (not that the Ministry of Magic had believed that -- they all thought that Mr. Crouch had gone mad). ",
    "\"Yeah, we were all surprised,\" said George, \"because Percy got into a load of trouble about Crouch, there was an inquiry and everything. They said Percy ought to have realized Crouch was off Percy rocker and informed a superior. But you know Percy, Crouch left Percy in charge, Percy wasn't going to complain...\" ",
    "\"So how come They promoted Percy?\" ",
    "\"That's exactly what we wondered,\" said Ron, who seemed very keen to keep normal conversation going now that Harry had stopped yelling. \"Harry came home really pleased with Harry -- even more pleased than usual if you can imagine that -- and told Dad Harry'd been offered a position in Fudge's own office. A really good one for someone only a year out of Hogwarts -- Junior Assistant to the Minister. Harry expected Dad to be all impressed, I think.\" ",
    "\"Dad wasn't,\" said Fred grimly. ",
    "\"Why not?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Well, apparently Fudge has been storming round the Ministry of Magic checking that nobody's having any contact with Dumbledore,\" said George. ",
    "\"Dumbledore's name's mud with the Ministry of Magic these days, see,\" said Fred. \"They all think Harry's just making trouble saying You-Know- Who's back.\" ",
    "Dad says Fudge has made it clear that anyone who's in league with Dumbledore can clear out anyone who's in league with Dumbledore desks,\" said George. ",
    "\"Trouble is, Fudge suspects Dad, George knows George's friendly with Dumbledore, and George's always thought Dad's a bit of a weirdo because of George Muggle obsession -- \" ",
    "\"But what's this got to do with Percy?\" asked Harry, confused. ",
    "\"I'm coming to that. Dad reckons Fudge only wants Percy in Percy office because Percy wants to use Percy to spy on the family -- and Dumbledore.\" ",
    "Harry let out a low whistle. ",
    "Percy Percy loved that.\" ",
    "Ron laughed in a hollow sort of way. ",
    "\"Ron went completely berserk. Ron said -- well, Ron said loads of terrible stuff. Ron said Ron's been having to struggle against Dad's lousy reputation ever since Ron joined the Ministry of Magic and that Dad's got no ambition and that's why we've always been -- you know -- not had a lot of money, I mean -- \" ",
    "\" What?\" said Harry in disbelief, as Ginny made a noise like an angry cat. ",
    "\"I know,\" said Ron in a low voice. \"And it got worse. ",
    "Ron said Dad was an idiot to run around with Dumbledore, that Dumbledore was heading for big trouble and Dad was going to go down with Dumbledore, and that Dumbledore -- Percy -- knew where Percy loyalty lay and it was with the Ministry of Magic. And if Mum and Dad were going to become traitors to the Ministry of Magic Dumbledore was going to make sure everyone knew Dumbledore didn't belong to everyone family anymore. And Dumbledore packed Dumbledore bags the same night and left. Dumbledore's living here in London now.\" ",
    "Harry swore under Harry breath. Harry had always liked Percy least of Ron's brothers, but Harry had never imagined Harry would say such things to Mr. Weasley. ",
    "\"Mum's been in a right state,\" said Ron. \"You know -- crying and stuff. \"Mum came up to London to try and talk to Percy but Percy slammed the door in \"Mum face. I dunno what Percy does if Percy meets Dad at work -- ignores Percy, I s'pose.\" ",
    "\"But Percy must know Voldemort's back,\" said Harry slowly. \"Percy's not stupid, Percy must know your mum and dad wouldn't risk everything without proof -- \" ",
    "\"Yeah, well, your name got dragged into the row,\" said Ron, shooting Harry a furtive look. \"Percy said the only evidence was your word and ... I dunno ... Percy didn't think it was good enough.\" ",
    "Percy Percy takes the Daily Prophet seriously,\" said Hermione tartly, and the others all nodded. ",
    "\"What are you talking about?\" Harry asked, looking around at them all. them all were all regarding Harry warily. ",
    "\"Haven't -- haven't you been getting the Daily Prophet?\" Hermione asked nervously. ",
    "\"Yeah, I have!\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Have you -- er -- been reading it thoroughly?\" Hermione asked still more anxiously. ",
    "\"Not cover to cover,\" said Harry defensively. \"If them all were going to report anything about Voldemort it would be headline news, wouldn't it!\" ",
    "the others all flinched at the sound of the name. Hermione hurried on, \"Well, you'd need to read it cover to cover to pick it up, but the others all -- um -- the others all mention you a couple of times a week.\" ",
    "\"But I'd have seen -- \" ",
    "\"Not if you've only been reading the front page, you wouldn't,\" said Hermione, shaking her head. \"I'm not talking about big articles. the others all just slip you in, like you're a standing joke.\" ",
    "\"What d'you -- ?\" ",
    "\"It's quite nasty, actually,\" said Hermione in a voice of forced calm. \"the others all're just building on Rita's stuff.\" ",
    "\"But Rita's not writing for the others all anymore, is Rita?\" ",
    "\"Oh no, Rita's kept Rita promise -- not that Rita's got any choice,\" Hermione added with satisfaction. \"But Rita laid the foundation for what the foundation're trying to do now.\" ",
    "\"Which is what?\" said Harry impatiently. ",
    "\"Okay, you know Rita wrote that you were collapsing all over the place and saying your scar was hurting and all that?\" ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Harry, who was not likely to forget Rita Skeeter's stories about Rita Skeeter's in a hurry. ",
    "\"Well, the foundation're writing about Rita Skeeter's as though you're this deluded, attention-seeking person who thinks Rita Skeeter's's a great tragic hero or something,\" said Hermione, very fast, as though it would be less unpleasant for Harry to hear these facts quickly. \"the foundation keep slipping in snide comments about you. If some far-fetched story appears the foundation say something like 'a tale worthy of Harry Potter' and if anyone has a funny accident or anything it's let's hope he hasn't got a scar on he forehead or we'll be asked to worship he next -- ' \" ",
    "\"I don't want anyone to worship -- \" Harry began hotly. ",
    "\"I know you don't,\" said Hermione quickly, looking frightened. \"I know, Harry. But you see what they're doing? they want to turn you into someone nobody will believe. Fudge is behind it, I'll bet anything. they want wizards on the street to think you're just some stupid boy who's a bit of a joke, who tells ridiculous  ",
    "tall stories because Harry loves being famous and wants to keep it going.\" ",
    "\"I didn't ask -- I didn't want -- Lord Voldemort ( killed my parentsV' Harry spluttered. \"I got famous because Lord Voldemort ( murdered my family but couldn't kill me! Who wants to be famous for that? Don't my family think I'd rather it'd never -- \" ",
    "\"We know, Harry,\" said Ginny earnestly. ",
    "\"And of course, my family didn't report a word about the dementors attacking you,\" said Hermione. \"Someone's told my family to keep that quiet. That should've been a really big story, out-of-control dementors. my family haven't even reported that you broke the International Statute of Secrecy -- we thought my family would, you broke the International Statute of Secrecy would tie in so well with this image of you as some stupid show-off -- we think my family're biding my family time until you're expelled, then my family're really going to go to town -- I mean, if you're expelled, obviously,\" she went on hastily, \"you really shouldn't be, not if my family abide by my family own laws, there's no case against you.\" ",
    "They were back on the hearing and Harry did not want to think about the hearing. Harry cast around for another change of subject, but was saved the necessity of finding one by the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs. ",
    "\"Uh-oh.\" ",
    "Fred gave the Extendable Ear a hearty tug; there was another loud crack and Harry and George vanished. Seconds later, Mr. Weasley appeared in the bedroom doorway. ",
    "\"The meeting's over, you can come down and have dinner now, everyone's dying to see you, Harry. And ",
    "who's left all those Dungbombs outside the kitchen door?\" ",
    "\"Crookshanks,\" said Ginny unblushingly. \"Harry loves playing with all those Dungbombs.\" ",
    "\"Oh,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"I thought it might have been Kreacher, Mr. Weasley keeps doing odd things like that. Now don't forget to keep your voices down in the hall. Ginny, your hands are filthy, what have you been doing? Go and wash your voices before dinner, please...Ginny Ginny grimaced at the others and followed Ginny mother out of the room, leaving Harry alone with Ron and Hermione again. Ron and Hermione Ron and Hermione were watching Harry apprehensively, as though Ron and Hermione feared that Harry would start shouting again now that everyone else had gone. The sight of Ron and Hermione looking so nervous made Harry feel slightly ashamed. ",
    "\"Look ...\" Harry muttered, but Ron shook Harry head, and Hermione said quietly, \"We knew you'd be angry, Harry, We really don't blame you, but you've got to understand, We did try and persuade Dumbledore -- \" ",
    "\"Yeah, I know,\" said Harry grudgingly. ",
    "Harry cast around for a topic to change the subject from Dumbledore -- the very thought of Harry made Harry's insides burn with anger again. ",
    "\"Who's Kreacher?\" Harry asked. ",
    "\"The house-elf who lives here,\" said Ron. \"Nutter. Never met one like Ron.\" ",
    "Hermione frowned at Ron. ",
    "\"Ron's not a nutter, Ron -- \" ",
    "\"Ron life's ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on a plaque just like her mother,\" said Ron irritably. \"Is that normal, Hermione?\" ",
    "\"Well -- well, if Ron is a bit strange, it's not Ron fault -- \" ",
    "Ron rolled Ron eyes at Harry. ",
    "Hermione still hasn't given up on spew -- \" ",
    "\"It's not 'spew'!\" said Hermione heatedly. \"It's the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, and it's not just me, Dumbledore says we should be kind to Kreacher too -- \" ",
    "\"Yeah, yeah,\" said Ron. \"C'mon, I'm starving.\" ",
    "Ron led the way out of the door and onto the landing, but before they could descend the stairs -- \"Hold the stairs!\" Ron breathed, flinging out an arm to stop Harry and Hermione walking any farther. \"Harry and Hermione're still in the hall, we might be able to hear something -- \" ",
    "The three of Harry and Hermione looked cautiously over the banisters. The gloomy hallway below was packed with witches and wizards, including all of Harry's guard. witches and wizards, including all of Harry's guard were whispering excitedly together. In the very center of the group Harry saw the dark, greasy-haired head and prominent nose of Snape. Harry leaned farther over the banisters. Harry was very interested in what Snape was doing for the Order of the Phoenix. . . ",
    "A thin piece of flesh-colored string descended in front of Harry's eyes. Looking up Harry saw Fred and George on the landing, cautiously lowering the Extendable Ear toward the dark knot of people below. A moment later, however, Fred and George began to move toward the front door and out of sight. ",
    "\"Dammit,Harry heard Fred whisper, as Harry hoisted the Extendable Ear back up again. ",
    "Fred and George heard the front door open and then close. ",
    "\"Snape never eats here,Ron Ron told Harry quietly. \"Thank God. C'mon.\" ",
    "\"And don't forget to keep your voice down in the hall, Harry,\" Hermione whispered. ",
    "As Fred and George passed the row of house-elf heads on the wall Fred and George saw Lupin, Mrs. Weasley, and Tonks at the front door, magically sealing the front door many locks and bolts behind those who had just left. ",
    "\"We're eating down in the kitchen,Mr. Weasley whispered, meeting Fred and George at the bottom of the stairs. \"Harry, dear, if youll just tiptoe across the hall, it's through this door here -- \" ",

    "\"I'm sorry!\" wailed Tonks, who was lying flat on the floor. \"It's that stupid umbrella stand, that's the second time I've tripped over -- \" ",
    "But the rest of Mr. Weasley words were drowned by a horrible, earsplitting, bloodcurdling screech. ",
    "The moth-eaten velvet curtains Harry had passed earlier had flown apart, but there was no door behind The moth-eaten velvet. For a split second, Harry thought Harry was looking through a window, a window behind which an old woman in a black cap was screaming and screaming as though an old woman in a black cap was being tortured -- then  ",
    "Harry realized it was simply a life-size portrait, but the most realistic, and the most unpleasant, Harry had ever seen in Harry life. ",
    "an old woman in a black cap was drooling, an old woman in a black cap eyes were rolling, the yellowing skin of an old woman in a black cap face stretched taut as an old woman in a black cap screamed, and all along the hall behind them, the other portraits awoke and began to yell too, so that Harry actually screwed up Harry eyes at the noise and clapped Harry hands over Harry ears. ",
    "Lupin and Mr. Weasley darted forward and tried to tug the curtains shut over an old woman in a black cap, but Lupin and Mrs. Weasley would not close and an old woman in a black cap screeched louder than ever, brandishing clawed hands as though trying to tear at Lupin and Mrs. Weasley faces. ",
    "\"Filth! Scum! By-products of dirt and vileness! Half- breeds, mutants, freaks, begone from this place! How dare you befoul the house of my fathers -- \" ",
    "Tonks apologized over and over again, at the same time dragging the huge, heavy troll's leg back off the floor. Mr. Weasley abandoned the attempt to close the curtains shut over the old woman and hurried up and down the hall, Stunning all the other portraits with Mr. Weasley wand. Then a man with long black hair came charging out of a door facing Harry. ",
    "\"Shut up, you horrible old hag, shut UP!\" a man with long black hair roared, seizing the curtain Mr. Weasley had abandoned. ",
    "an old woman in a black cap's face blanched. ",

    "\"But what's a portrait of her mother doing here?\" Harry asked, bewildered, as they went through the door from the hall and led the way down a flight of narrow stone steps, the others just behind them. ",
    "\"Hasn't anyone told you? This was my parents' house,\" said Sirius. \"But I'm the last Black left, so it's mine now. I offered it to Dumbledore for headquarters -- about the only useful thing I've been able to do.\" ",

    "It was scarcely less gloomy than the hall, a cavernous room with rough stone walls. Most of the light was coming from a large fire at the far end of a cavernous room with rough stone walls. A haze of pipe smoke hung in the air like battle fumes, through which loomed the menacing shapes of heavy iron pots and pans hanging from the dark ceiling. Many chairs had been crammed into a cavernous room with rough stone walls and a long wooden table stood in the middle of a cavernous room with rough stone walls, littered with rolls of parchment, goblets, empty wine bottles, and a heap of what appeared to be rags. Mr. Weasley and his eldest son, Bill, were talking quietly with Mr. Weasley and his eldest son, Bill heads together at the end of the table. ",
    "Mr. Weasley cleared Mr. Weasley throat. Mr. Weasley husband, a thin, balding, red-haired man, who wore horn-rimmed glasses, looked around and jumped to Her husband, a thin, balding, red-haired man, who wore horn-rimmed glasses feet. ",
    "\"Harry!\" Mr. Weasley said, hurrying forward to greet Mr. Weasley and shaking Mr. Weasley hand vigorously. \"Good to see you!\" ",
    "Over Mr. Weasley shoulder Harry saw Bill, who still wore Mr. Weasley long hair in a ponytail, hastily rolling up the lengths of parchment left on the table. ",
    "\"Journey all right, Harry?\" Bill called, trying to gather up twelve scrolls at once. \"Mad-Eye didn't make you come via Greenland, then?\" ",
    "\"Mad-Eye tried,\" said Tonks, striding over to help Bill and immediately sending a candle toppling onto the last piece of parchment. \"Oh no -- sorry -- \" ",
    "\"Here, dear,\" said Mr. Weasley, sounding exasperated, and Mr. Weasley repaired a candle toppling onto the last piece of parchment with a wave of her wand: In the flash of light caused by Mr. Weasley's charm, Harry caught a glimpse of what looked like the plan of a building. ",
    "Mr. Weasley had seen Mr. Weasley looking. Mr. Weasley snatched the plan of a building off the table and stuffed the plan of a building into Bill's heavily laden arms. ",
    "\"This sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly at the end of meetings,\" Mr. Weasley snapped before sweeping off toward an ancient dresser from which Mr. Weasley started unloading dinner plates. ",
    "Bill took out Bill , muttered \"Evanescol\" and twelve scrolls vanished. ",
    "\"Sit down, Harry,\" said Sirius. \"You've met Mundungus, haven't you?\" ",
    "The thing Harry had taken to be a pile of rags gave a prolonged, grunting snore and then jerked awake. ",
    "\"Some'n say m' name?\" Mundungus mumbled sleepily. \"I 'gree with Sirius...\" ",
    "Mr. Weasley raised a very grubby hand in the air as though voting, Mr. Weasley droopy, bloodshot eyes unfocused. Ginny giggled. ",
    "\"The meeting's over, Dung,\" said Sirius, as they all sat down around Mr. Weasley at the table. \"Harry's arrived.\" ",
    "\"Eh?\" said Mundungus, peering balefully at Harry through Harry matted ginger hair. \"Blimey, so 'e 'as. ",
    "Yeah ... you all right, 'arry?\" ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Harry. ",
    "Mundungus fumbled nervously in Mundungus pockets, still staring at Harry, and pulled out a grimy black pipe. ",
    "Mundungus stuck a grimy black pipe in Mundungus mouth, ignited the end of a grimy black pipe with Mundungus , and took a deep pull on a grimy black pipe. Great billowing clouds of greenish smoke obscured Mundungus in seconds.  ",
    "\"Owe you a 'pology,\" grunted a voice from the middle of the smelly cloud. ",
    "\"For the last time, Mundungus,\" called Mrs. Weasley, \"will you please not smoke that thing in the kitchen, especially not when we're about to eat!\" ",
    "\"Ah,\" said Mundungus. \"Right. Sorry, Molly.\" ",
    "The cloud of smoke vanished as Mundungus stowed a grimy black pipe back in Mundungus pocket, but an acrid smell of burning socks lingered. ",
    "\"And if you want dinner before midnight I'll need a hand,\" Mr. Weasley said to the room at large. \"No, you can stay where you are, Harry dear, you've had a long journey -- \" ",
    "\"What can I do, Molly?\" said Tonks enthusiastically, bounding forward. ",
    "Mr. Weasley hesitated, looking apprehensive. ",
    "\"Er -- no, it's all right, Tonks, you have a rest too, you've done enough today -- \" ",
    "\"No, no, I want to help!\" said Tonks brightly, knocking over a chair as Molly hurried toward the dresser from which Ginny was collecting cutlery. ",
    "Soon a series of heavy knives were chopping meat and vegetables of a series of heavy knives own accord, supervised by Mr. Weasley, while Mr. Weasley stirred a cauldron dangling over the fire and the others took out plates, more goblets, and food from the pantry. Harry was left at the table with Sirius and Mundungus, who was still blinking mournfully at Harry. ",
    "\"Seen old Figgy since?\" Harry asked. ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry, \"I haven't seen anyone.\" ",
    "\"See, I wouldn't 'ave left,\" said Mundungus, leaning forward, a pleading note in Mundungus voice, \"but I 'ad a business opportunity -- \" ",
    "Harry felt something brush against Harry knees and started, but it was only Crookshanks, Hermione's bandy-legged ginger cat, who wound Harry once around Harry's legs, purring, then jumped onto Sirius's lap and curled up. Sirius scratched Harry absentmindedly behind the ears as Harry turned, still grim-faced, to Harry. ",
    "\"Had a good summer so far?\" ",
    "\"No, it's been lousy,\" said Harry. ",
    "For the first time, something like a grin flitted across Sirius's face. ",
    "\"Don't know what you're complaining about, Harry.\" ",
    "\" What?\" said Harry incredulously. ",
    "\"Personally, I'd have welcomed a dementor attack. A deadly struggle for my soul would have broken the monotony nicely. You think you've had A deadly struggle for my soul bad, at least you've been able to get out and about, stretch your legs, get into a few fights... I've been stuck inside for a month.\" ",
    "\"How come?\" asked Harry, frowning. ",
    "\"Because the Ministry of Magic's still after Harry, and Voldemort will know all about me being an Animagus by now, Wormtail will have told Wormtail, so my big disguise is useless. There's not much I can do for the Order of THE PHOENIX ",
    " ... or so Dumbledore feels.\" ",
    "There was something about the slightly flattened tone of voice in which Sirius uttered Dumbledore's name that told Harry that Sirius was not very happy with the headmaster either. Harry felt a sudden upsurge of affection for his godfather. ",
    "\"At least you've known what's been going on,\" Harry said bracingly. ",
    "\"Oh yeah,\" said Sirius sarcastically. \"Listening to Snape's reports, having to take all Harry snide hints that Harry's out there risking Harry life while I'm sat on my backside here having a nice comfortable time . . . asking me how the cleaning's going -- \" ",
    "\"What cleaning?\" asked Harry. ",
    "\"Trying to make this place fit for human habitation,\" said Sirius, waving a hand around the dismal kitchen. \"No one's lived here for ten years, not since my dear mother died, unless you count my dear mother old house-elf, and he's gone round the twist, hasn't cleaned anything in ages -- \" ",
    "\"Sirius?\" said Mundungus, who did not appear to have paid any attention to this conversation, but had been minutely examining an empty goblet. \"This solid silver, mate?\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Sirius, surveying Sirius with distaste. \"Finest fifteenth-century goblin-wrought silver, embossed with the Black family crest.\" ",
    "\"That'd come off, though,\" muttered Mundungus, polishing Mundungus with Mundungus cuff. ",
    "\"Fred -- George -- NO, JUST CARRY Finest fifteenth-century goblin-wrought silver, embossed with the Black family crest!\" Mr. Weasley shrieked. ",
    "Harry, Sirius, and Mundungus looked around and, a split second later, dived away from the table. \"Fred -- George -- and George -- had bewitched a large cauldron of stew, an iron flagon of butterbeer, and a heavy wooden breadboard, complete with knife, to hurtle through the air toward Fred and George. The stew skidded the length of the table and came to a halt just before the end, leaving a long black burn on the wooden surface, the flagon of butterbeer fell with a crash, spilling the flagon of butterbeer contents everywhere, and the bread knife slipped off the board and landed, point down and quivering ominously, exactly where Sirius's right hand had been seconds before. ",
    "\"FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE!\" screamed Mr. Weasley. \"THERE WAS NO NEED -- IVE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS -- JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ALLOWED TO USE MAGIC NOW YOU DONT HAVE TO WHIP YOUR WANDS OUT FOR EVERY TINY LITTLE THING!\" ",
    "\"We were just trying to save a bit of time!\" said \"Fred -- George --, hurrying forward and wrenching the bread knife out of the table. \"Sorry Sirius, mate -- didn't mean to -- \" ",
    "Harry and Sirius were both laughing. Mundungus, who had toppled backward off his chair, was swearing as his got to his . Crookshanks had given an angry hiss and shot off under the dresser, from whence his large yellow eyes glowed in the darkness. ",
    "\"Boys,\" Mr. Weasley said, lifting The stew back into the middle of the table, \"your mother's right, you're supposed to show a sense of responsibility now you've come of age -- \" ",
    "\" -- none of your brothers caused this sort of trouble!\" Mr. Weasley raged at the twins, slamming a fresh flagon of butterbeer onto the table and spilling almost as much again. \"Bill didn't feel the need to Apparate ",
    "every few feet! Charlie didn't Charm everything Charlie met! Percy -- \" ",
    "She stopped dead, catching She breath with a frightened look at She husband, whose expression was suddenly wooden. ",
    "\"Let's eat,\" said Bill quickly. ",
    "\"It looks wonderful, Molly,\" said Lupin, ladling stew onto a plate for Molly and handing a plate for her across the table. ",
    "For a few minutes there was silence but for the chink of plates and cutlery and the scraping of chairs as everyone settled down to the chink of plates and cutlery and the scraping of chairs food. Then Mr. Weasley turned to Sirius and said, \"I've been meaning to tell you, there's something trapped in that writing desk in the drawing room, it keeps rattling and shaking. Of course, it could just be a boggart, but I thought we ought to ask Alastor to have a look at Alastor before we let Alastor out.\" ",
    "\"Whatever you like,\" said Sirius indifferently. ",
    "\"The curtains in there are full of doxies too,\" Mr. Weasley went on. \"I thought we might try and tackle The curtains in there tomorrow.\" ",
    "\"I look forward to it,\" said Sirius. Harry heard the sarcasm in Harry voice, but Harry was not sure that anyone else did. ",
    "Harry, Tonks was entertaining Hermione and Ginny by transforming Ginny nose between mouthfuls. Screwing up Ginny eyes each time with the same pained expression Ginny had worn back in Harry's bedroom, Ginny nose swelled to a beaklike protuberance like Snape's, shrank to something resembling a button mushroom, and then sprouted a great deal of  ",
    "hair from each nostril. Apparently this was a regular mealtime entertainment, because after a while Hermione and Ginny started requesting Hermione and Ginny favorite noses. ",
    "\"Do that one like a pig snout, Tonks ...\" ",
    "Tonks obliged, and Harry, looking up, had the fleeting impression that a female Dudley was grinning at a female Dudley from across the table. ",
    "Mr. Weasley, Bill, and Lupin were having an intense discussion about goblins. ",
    "\"Mr. Weasley, Bill, and Lupin're not giving anything away yet,\" said Bill. \"I still can't work out whether Mr. Weasley, Bill, and Lupin believe a female Dudley's back or not. 'Course, Mr. Weasley, Bill, and Lupin might prefer not to take sides at all. Keep out of it.\" ",
    "\"I'm sure Mr. Weasley, Bill, and Lupin'd never go over to You-Know-Who,\" said Mr. Weasley, shaking Mr. Weasley head. \"Mr. Weasley, Bill, and Lupin've suffered losses too. Remember that goblin family Mr. Weasley murdered last time, somewhere near Nottingham?\" ",
    "\"I think it depends what that goblin family he murdered last time, somewhere near Nottingham're offered,\" said Lupin. \"And I'm not talking about gold; if that goblin family he murdered last time, somewhere near Nottingham're offered freedoms we've been denying that goblin family he murdered last time, somewhere near Nottingham for centuries that goblin family he murdered last time, somewhere near Nottingham're going to be tempted. Have you still not had any luck with Ragnok, Bill?\" ",
    "\"Bill's feeling pretty anti-wizard at the moment,\" said Bill. \"Bill hasn't stopped raging about the Bagman business, Bill reckons the Ministry of Magic's did a cover-up, those goblins never got those goblins gold from Bill, you know ",
    "A gale of laughter from the middle of the table drowned the rest of Bill's words. Fred, George, Ron, and Mundungus were rolling around in Fred, George, Ron, and Mundungus seats. ",
    "\"... and then,\" choked Mundungus, tears running down his face, \"and then, if you'll believe it, 'e says to e, 'e says, ''ere, Dung, where didja get all them toads from? 'Cos some son of a Bludger's gone and nicked all mine!' And I says, 'Nicked all your toads, Will, what next? So you'll be wanting some more, then?' And if you'll believe me, lads, the gormless gargoyle buys all 'is own toads back orf me for twice what 'e paid in the first place -- #\" ",
    "\"I don't think we need to hear any more of your business dealings, thank you very much, Mundungus,\" said Mr. Weasley sharply, as Ron slumped forward onto the table, howling with laughter. ",
    "\"Beg pardon, Molly,\" said Mundungus at once, wiping Mundungus eyes and winking at Harry. \"But, you know, Will nicked 'em orf Warty Harris in the first place so I wasn't really doing nothing wrong -- \" ",
    "\"I don't know where you learned about right and wrong, Mundungus, but you seem to have missed a few crucial lessons,\" said Mr. Weasley coldly. ",
    "Fred and George buried Fred and George faces in Fred and George goblets of butterbeer; George -- was hiccuping. For some reason, Mr. Weasley threw a very nasty look at Sirius before getting to his feet and going to fetch a large rhubarb crumble for pudding. Harry looked round at Harry godfather. ",
    "\"Molly doesn't approve of Mundungus,\" said Sirius in an undertone. ",
    "\"How come Harry's in the Order?\" Harry said very quietly. ",
    "\"Harry's useful,Sirius Sirius muttered. \"Knows all the crooks -- well, Harry would, seeing as Harry's one himself. But Harry's also very loyal to Dumbledore, who helped Harry out of a tight spot once. It pays to have someone like Dung around, Harry hears things we don't. But \"Molly thinks inviting Harry to stay for dinner is going too far. \"Molly hasn't forgiven Harry for slipping off duty when Harry was supposed to be tailing you.\" ",
    "Three helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later and the waistband on Harry's jeans was feeling uncomfortably tight (which was saying something, as Harry's jeans had once been Dudley's). Harry lay down Harry spoon in a lull in the general conversation. Mr. Weasley was leaning back in his chair, looking replete and relaxed, Tonks was yawning widely, Tonks nose now back to normal, and Ginny, who had lured Crookshanks out from under the dresser, was sitting cross-legged on the floor, rolling butterbeer corks for Mr. Weasley to chase. ",
    "\"Nearly time for bed, I think,\" said Mr. Weasley on a yawn. ",
    "\"Not just yet, \"Molly,\" said Sirius, pushing away Mr. Weasley empty plate and turning to look at Harry. \"You know, I'm surprised at \"Molly. I thought the first thing you'd do when you got here would be to start asking questions about Voldemort.\" ",
    "The atmosphere in the room changed with the rapidity Harry associated with the arrival of dementors. Where seconds before it had been sleepily relaxed, it was now alert, even tense. A frisson had gone around the table at the mention of Voldemort's name. Lupin, who had been about to take a sip of wine, lowered his goblet slowly, looking wary. ",
    "\"I did!\" said Harry indignantly. \"I asked Ron and Hermione but Ron and Hermione said Ron and Hermione're not allowed in the Order, so -- \" ",
    "\"And Ron and Hermione're quite right,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"You're too young.\" ",
    "Mr. Weasley was sitting bolt upright in his chair, Mr. Weasley fists clenched upon bolt upright in her chair arms, every trace of drowsiness gone. ",
    "\"Since when did someone have to be in the Order of the Phoenix to ask questions?\" asked Sirius. \"Harry's been trapped in that Muggle house for a month. Harry's got the right to know what's been happen -- \" ",
    "\"Hang on!\" interrupted George -- loudly. ",
    "\"How come Harry gets Harry questions answered?\" said \"Fred -- George -- angrily. ",
    "\" Ron and Hermione've been trying to get stuff out of you for a month and you haven't told Ron and Hermione a single stinking thing!\" said George --. ",
    "\" 'You're too young, you're not in the Order,' \" said \"Fred -- George --, in a high-pitched voice that sounded uncannily like \"Fred -- George -- mother's. \"Harry's not even of age!\" ",
    "\"It's not my fault you haven't been told what the Order's doing,\" said Sirius calmly. \"That's your parents' decision. Harry, on the other hand -- \" ",
    "\"It's not down to Harry to decide what's good for Harry!\" said Mr. Weasley sharply. Mr. Weasley normally kindly face looked dangerous. \"You haven't forgotten what Dumbledore said, I suppose?\" ",
    "\"Which bit?Sirius asked politely, but with an air as though readying himself for a fight. ",
    "\"The bit about not telling Harry more than Harry needs to know,\" said Mr. Weasley, placing a heavy emphasis on the last three words. ",
    "Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George --'s heads turned from Sirius to Mr. Weasley as though following a tennis rally. Ginny was kneeling amid a pile of abandoned butterbeer corks, watching the conversation with Ginny mouth slightly open. Lupin's eyes were fixed on Sirius. ",
    "\"I don't intend to tell Lupin more than Lupin needs to know, Molly,\" said Sirius. \"But as Lupin was the one who saw Voldemort come back\" (again, there was a collective shudder around the table at the name), \"Lupin has more right than most to -- \" ",
    "\"Lupin's not a member of the Order of the Phoenix!\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Mr. Weasley's only fifteen and -- \" ",
    "\" -- and Mr. Weasley's dealt with as much as most in the Order,\" said Sirius, \"and more than some -- \" ",
    "\"No one's denying what Mr. Weasley's done!\" said Mr. Weasley, Mr. Weasley voice rising, her fists trembling on the arms of his chair. \"But Mr. Weasley's still -- \" ",
    "\"Mr. Weasley's not a child!\" said Sirius impatiently. ",
    "\"Mr. Weasley's not an adult either!\" said Mrs. Weasley, the color rising in Mr. Weasley cheeks. \"Mr. Weasley's not James, Sirius!\" ",
    "\"I'm perfectly clear who Mr. Weasley is, thanks, Molly,\" said Sirius coldly. ",
    "'Tm not sure you are!\" said Mr. Weasley. ",
    "\"Sometimes, the way you talk about Mr. Weasley, it's as though you think you've got your best friend back!\" ",
    "\"What's wrong with that?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"What's wrong, Harry, is that you are not your father, however much you might look like Harry!\" said Mr. Weasley, Mr. Weasley eyes still boring into Sirius. \"You are still at school and adults responsible for you should not forget it!\" ",
    "\"Meaning I'm an irresponsible godfather?\" demanded Sirius, Harry voice rising. ",
    "\"Meaning you've been known to act rashly, Sirius, which is why Dumbledore keeps reminding you to stay at home and -- \" ",
    "\"We'll leave my instructions from Dumbledore out of this, if you please!\" said Sirius loudly. ",
    "\"Arthur!\" said Mrs. Weasley, rounding on her husband. \"\"Arthur, back me up!\" ",
    "Mr. Weasley did not speak at once. Mr. Weasley took off Mr. Weasley glasses and cleaned his glasses slowly on Mr. Weasley robes, not looking at Mr. Weasley wife. Only when Mr. Weasley had replaced his glasses carefully on Mr. Weasley nose did Mr. Weasley say, Dumbledore knows the position has changed, \"Molly. Mr. Weasley accepts that Harry will have to be filled in to a certain extent now that Mr. Weasley is staying at headquarters -- \" ",
    "\"Yes, but there's a difference between that and inviting Mr. Weasley to ask whatever Mr. Weasley likes!\" ",
    "\"Personally,\" said Lupin quietly, looking away from Sirius at last, as Mr. Weasley turned quickly to Mr. Weasley, hopeful that finally Mr. Weasley was about to get an ally, \"I ",
    "think it better that Harry gets the facts -- not all the facts, \"Molly, but the general picture -- from us, rather than a garbled version from ... others.\" ",
    "Harry expression was mild, but Harry felt sure that Lupin, at least, knew that some Extendable Ears had survived Mr. Weasley's purge. ",
    "\"Well,\" said Mr. Weasley, breathing deeply and looking around the table for support that did not come, \"well ... I can see I'm going to be overruled. I'll just say this: Dumbledore must have had Dumbledore reasons for not wanting Harry to know too much, and speaking as someone who has got Harry's best interests at heart -- \" ",
    "\"Dumbledore's not your son,\" said Sirius quietly. ",
    "\"Dumbledore's as good as,\" said Mr. Weasley fiercely. \"Who else has Dumbledore got?\" ",
    "\"Dumbledore's got me!\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Weasley, the color rising in her cheeks. \"The thing is, it's been rather difficult for you to look after Dumbledore while you've been locked up in Azkaban, hasn't it?Sirius Sirius started to rise from Dumbledore . ",
    "\"Molly, you're not the only person at this table who cares about Harry,\" said Lupin sharply. \"Sirius, sit down.\" ",
    "Mr. Weasley's lower lip was trembling. Sirius sank slowly back into Dumbledore , Dumbledore face white. ",
    "\"I think Harry ought to be allowed a say in this,\" ",
    "Lupin continued. \"Harry's old enough to decide for Harry.\" ",
    "\"I want to know what's been going on,Harry Harry said at once. ",
    "Harry did not look at Mr. Weasley. Harry had been touched by what Mr. Weasley had said about Harry being as good as a son, but Harry was also impatient at Mr. Weasley mollycoddling. . . Sirius was right, Harry was not a child. ",
    "\"Very well,\" said Mrs. Weasley, the color rising in her cheeks. \"Ginny -- Ron -- Hermione -- Fred -- George -- -- I want you out of this kitchen, now.\" ",
    "There was instant uproar. ",
    "\"We're of age!\" Fred and George bellowed together. ",
    "\"If Harry's allowed, why can't I?\" shouted Ron. ",
    "\"Mum, I want to!\" wailed Ginny. ",
    "\"NO!\" shouted Mr. Weasley, standing up, Mr. Weasley eyes overbright. \"I absolutely forbid -- \" ",
    "\"Molly, you can't stop Fred and George,\" said Mr. Weasley wearily. \"Fred and George are of age -- \" ",
    "\"Fred and George're still at school -- \" ",
    "\"But Fred and George're legally adults now,\" said Mr. Weasley in the same tired voice. ",
    "Mr. Weasley was now scarlet in the face. ",
    "\"I -- oh, all right then, \"Fred -- George -- and George -- can stay, but Ron -- \" ",
    "\"Harry'll tell me and Hermione everything you say anyway!\" said Ron hotly. \"Won't -- won't you?\" Ron added uncertainly, meeting Harry's eyes. ",
    "For a split second, Harry considered telling Ron that Ron wouldn't tell Ron a single word, that Ron could try a taste of being kept in the dark and see how Ron liked it. But the nasty impulse vanished as they looked at each other. ",
    "\" 'Course I will,\" Harry said. Ron Hermione beamed. ",
    "\"Fine!\" shouted Mr. Weasley. \"Fine! Ginny -- BED!\" ",
    "Ginny did not go quietly. Ron and Hermione could hear \" ",
    "Ginny raging and storming at \" ",
    "Ginny mother all the way up the stairs, and when \" ",
    "Ginny reached the hall Mrs. Black's earsplitting shrieks were added to the din. Lupin hurried off to the portrait to restore calm. It was only after Lupin had returned, closing the kitchen door behind Lupin and taking Lupin seat at the table again, that Sirius spoke. ",
    "\"Okay, Harry ... what do you want to know?\" ",
    "Harry took a deep breath and asked the question that had been obsessing Harry for a month. ",
    "\"Where's Voldemort? What's Harry doing? I've been trying to watch the Muggle news,\" Harry said, ignoring the renewed shudders and winces at the name, \"and there hasn't been anything that looks like Harry yet, no funny deaths or anything -- \" ",
    "\"That's because there haven't been any suspicious deaths yet,\" said Sirius, \"not as far as we know, anyway... And we know quite a lot.\" ",
    "\"More than Harry thinks we do anyway,\" said Lupin. ",
    "\"How come Harry's stopped killing people?\" Harry asked. Harry knew that Voldemort had murdered more than once in the last year alone. ",
    "\"Because Harry doesn't want to draw attention to Harry at the moment,\" said Sirius. \"It would be dangerous for Harry. Harry comeback didn't come off quite the way Harry wanted it to, you see. Harry messed it up.\" ",
    "\"Or rather, you messed it up for Harry,\" said Lupin with a satisfied smile. ",
    "\"How?\" Harry asked perplexedly. ",
    "\"You weren't supposed to survive!\" said Sirius. \"Nobody apart from Harry Death Eaters was supposed to know Harry'd come back. But you survived to bear witness.\" ",
    "\"And the very last person Harry wanted alerted to Harry return the moment Harry got back was Dumbledore,\" said Lupin. \"And you made sure Dumbledore knew at once.\" ",
    "\"How has that helped?\" Harry asked. ",
    "\"Are you kidding?\" said Bill incredulously. \"Dumbledore was the only one You-Know-Who was ever scared of!\" ",
    "\"Thanks to you, Dumbledore was able to recall the Order of the Phoenix about an hour after Voldemort returned,\" said Sirius. ",
    "\"So what's the Order of the Phoenix been doing?\" said Harry, looking around at them all. ",
    "\"Working as hard as we can to make sure Voldemort can't carry out Voldemort plans,\" said Sirius. ",
    "\"How d'you know what d'you are?\" Harry asked quickly. ",
    "DumbledoreDumbledore's got a shrewd idea,\" said Lupin, \"and Dumbledore's shrewd ideas normally turn out to be accurate.\" ",
    "\"So what does Dumbledore reckon Dumbledore's planning?\" ",
    "\"Well, firstly, Dumbledore wants to build up Dumbledore army again,\" said Sirius. \"In the old days Dumbledore had huge numbers at Dumbledore command; witches and wizards Dumbledore'd bullied or bewitched into following Dumbledore, Dumbledore faithful Death Eaters, a great variety of Dark creatures. You heard Dumbledore planning to recruit the giants; well, his faithful Death Eaters, a great variety of Dark creatures'll be just one group Dumbledore's after. Dumbledore's certainly not going to try and take on the Ministry of Magic with only a dozen Death Eaters.\" ",
    "\"So you're trying to stop Dumbledore getting more followers?\" \"We're doing We best,\" said Lupin. ",
    "\"How?\" ",
    "\"Well, the main thing is to try and convince as many people as possible that You-Know-Who really has returned, to put them on them guard,\" said Bill. \"It's proving tricky, though.\" ",
    "\"Why?\" ",
    "\"Because of the Ministry's attitude,\" said Tonks. \"You saw Cornelius Fudge after You-Know-Who came back, Harry. Well, Cornelius Fudge hasn't shifted Cornelius Fudge position at all. Cornelius Fudge's absolutely refusing to believe it's happened.\" ",
    "\"But why?\" said Harry desperately. \"Why's Cornelius Fudge being so stupid? If Dumbledore -- \" ",
    "\"Ah, well, you've put your finger on the problem,\" said Mr. Weasley with a wry smile. Dumbledore.\" ",
    "\"Fudge is frightened of Dumbledore, you see,\" said Tonks sadly. ",
    "\"Frightened of Dumbledore?\" said Harry incredulously. ",
    "\"Frightened of what Cornelius Fudge's up to,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"You see, Cornelius Fudge thinks Dumbledore's plotting to overthrow Dumbledore. Mr. Weasley thinks Dumbledore wants to be Minister of Magic.\" ",
    "\"But Dumbledore doesn't want -- \" ",
    "\"Of course Dumbledore doesn't,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Dumbledore's never wanted the Minister's job, even though a lot of people wanted Dumbledore to take it when Millicent Bagnold retired. Cornelius Fudge came to power instead, but Dumbledore's never quite forgotten how much popular support Dumbledore had, even though Dumbledore never applied for the Minister's job.\" ",
    "\"Deep down, Fudge knows Dumbledore's much cleverer than Dumbledore is, a much more powerful wizard, and in the early days of Dumbledore Ministry Dumbledore was forever asking Dumbledore for help and advice,\" said Lupin. \"But it seems that Dumbledore's become fond of power now, and much more confident. Dumbledore loves being Minister of Magic, and Dumbledore's managed to convince Dumbledore that Dumbledore's the clever one and Dumbledore's simply stirring up trouble for the sake of it.\" ",
    "\"How can Dumbledore think that?\" said Harry angrily. \"How can Dumbledore think Dumbledore would just make it all up -- that I'd make it all up?\" ",
    "\"Because accepting that Voldemort's back would mean trouble like the Ministry hasn't had to cope with for nearly fourteen years,\" said Sirius bitterly. \"Fudge just can't bring Dumbledore to face it. It's so much more comfortable to convince Dumbledore Dumbledore's lying to destabilize Dumbledore.\" ",
    "\"You see the problem,\" said Lupin. \"While the Ministry insists there is nothing to fear from Voldemort, it's hard to convince people Dumbledore's back, especially as people really don't want to believe it in the first place. What's more, the Ministry's leaning heavily on the Daily Prophet not to report any of what the Ministry're calling Dumbledore's rumormongering, so most of the Wizarding community are completely unaware anything's happened, and that makes the Ministry easy targets for the Death Eaters if the Ministry're using the Imperius Curse.\" ",
    "\"But you're telling people, aren't you?\" said Harry, looking around at Mr. Weasley, Sirius, Bill, Mundungus, Lupin, and Tonks. \"You're letting people know Dumbledore's back?\" ",

    "\"We've managed to convince a couple of people, though,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Tonks here, for one -- Tonks here's too young to have been in the Order of the Phoenix last time, and having Aurors on our side is a huge advantage -- Kingsley Shacklebolt's been a real asset too.

    "\"But if Voldemort's trying to recruit more Death Eaters, it's bound to get out that Voldemort's come back, isn't it?\" asked Harry desperately. ",
    "\"Voldemort doesn't march up to people's houses and bang on people's houses and bang front doors, Harry,\" said Sirius. \"Harry tricks, jinxes, and blackmails people's houses and bang. Harry's well- practiced at operating in secrecy. In any case, gathering followers is only one thing Harry's interested in, Harry's got other plans too, plans Harry can put into operation very quietly indeed, and Harry's concentrating on gathering followers at the moment.\" ",
    "\"What's Harry after apart from followers?\" Harry asked swiftly. ",

    "\"No.\" ",
    "It was not Mr. Weasley who spoke this time, but Lupin. ",
    "\"The Order is comprised only of overage wizards,\" Harry said. \"Wizards who have left school,\" Harry added, as Fred, George, Ron and George opened Fred and George mouths. \"There are dangers involved of which you can have no idea, any of you ...

    "\"You're related to the Malfoys!\" ",
    "\"The pure-blood families are all interrelated,\" said Sirius. \"If you're only going to let your sons and daughters marry purebloods your choice is very limited, there are hardly any of us left.

    "Harry looked at Harry curiously. ",
    "\"Bellatrix and Bellatrix husband Rodolphus came in with Barty Crouch, Junior,\" said Sirius in the same brusque voice. \"Rodolphus 's brother, Rabastan, was with Rodolphus 's brother, Rabastan too.\" ",

    "\"You never said her was your -- \" ",
    "\"Does it matter if her's my cousin?\" snapped Sirius. \"As far as I'm concerned, they're not my family. her's certainly not my family. I haven't seen her since I was your age, unless you count a glimpse of her coming in to Azkaban. D'you think I'm proud of having relatives like her?\" ",

    "Harry understood completely. Harry knew how Harry would feel if forced, when Harry was grown up and thought Harry was free of the place forever, to return and live at number four, Privet Drive. ",

    "\"My father put every security measure known to Wizard-kind on it when My father lived here. It's Unplottable, so Muggles could never come and call -- as if Muggles'd have wanted to -- and now Dumbledore's added Dumbledore protection, you'd be hard put to find a safer house  ",
    "anywhere. Dumbledore's Secret-Keeper for the Order, you know -- nobody can find headquarters unless Dumbledore tells Muggles personally where it is -- that note Moody showed you last night, that was from Dumbledore...Sirius gave a short, barklike laugh. \"If my parents could see the use it was being put to now ... well, my mother's portrait should give you some idea...\" ",

Harry had not thought about your hearing once since dinner the previous evening; in the excitement of being back with the people Harry liked best, of hearing everything that was going on, your hearing had completely flown Harry mind. At Sirius's words, however, the crushing sense of dread returned to Harry. Harry stared at Hermione and the Weasleys, all tucking into their sandwiches, and thought how Harry would feel if their went back to Hogwarts without Harry. ",
    "\"Don't worry,\" Sirius said. Harry looked up and realized that Sirius had been watching Harry. \"I'm sure their're going to clear you, there's definitely something in the International Statute of Secrecy about being allowed to use magic to save your own life.\" ",

    "Harry tried Harry best not to think about your hearing while they emptied the glass cabinets that afternoon. Fortunately for Harry, it was a job that required a lot of concentration, as many of the objects in there seemed very reluctant to leave their dusty shelves. Sirius sustained a bad bite from a silver snuffbox; within seconds, Harry bitten hand had developed an unpleasant crusty covering like a tough brown glove. ",
    "\"It's okay,\" Harry said, examining his bitten hand with interest before tapping it lightly with Harry wand and restoring his wand skin to normal, \"must be Wartcap powder in there.\" ",
    "Harry threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing the debris from the cabinets; Harry saw George wrap Harry own hand carefully in a cloth moments later and sneak the box into Harry already doxy-filled pocket. ",
    "they found an unpleasant-looking silver instrument, something like a many-legged pair of tweezers, which scuttled up Harry's arm like a spider when Harry picked a spider up, and attempted to puncture Harry skin; Sirius seized a spider and smashed a spider with a heavy book entitled Nature's Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. There was a  ",

    "\"It means he gave they a load of gold,\" said Sirius contemptuously, throwing the medal into the rubbish sack. ",

    "\"It was My father's,\" said Sirius, throwing a large golden ring bearing the Black crest from his grip into the rubbish sack. \"Kreacher wasn't quite as devoted to Kreacher as to my mother, but I still caught Kreacher snogging a pair of My father's old trousers last week.\" ",
    "\" Mrs. Weasley kept them all working very hard over the next few days.

",
    "Snape might refer to The china, which bore the Black crest and motto work as \"cleaning,\" but in Harry's opinion The china, which bore the Black crest and motto were really waging war on the house, which was putting up a very good fight, aided and abetted by Kreacher. The house-elf kept appearing wherever The china, which bore the Black crest and motto were congregated, The house-elf muttering becoming more and more offensive as The house-elf attempted to remove anything The house-elf could from the rubbish sacks. Sirius went as far as to threaten The house-elf with clothes, but Kreacher fixed The house-elf with a watery stare and said, \"Master must do as Master wishes,\" before turning away and muttering very loudly, \"but Master will not turn Kreacher away, no, because Kreacher knows what they are up to, oh yes, The house-elf is plotting against the Dark Lord, yes, with these Mudbloods and traitors and scum...\" ",

Fear jabbed at Mundungus insides like needles as Mundungus wondered what was going to happen to Mundungus if Mundungus was expelled. The idea was so terrible that Mundungus did not dare voice The idea aloud, not even to Ron and Hermione, who, though Mundungus often saw them whispering together and casting anxious looks in Mundungus direction, followed Mundungus lead in not mentioning it. Sometimes Mundungus could not prevent Mundungus imagination showing Mundungus a faceless Ministry official who was snapping Mundungus in two and ordering Mundungus back to the Dursleys' ... but Mundungus would not go.

    "\"I didn't do it,\" said Harry stupidly, thinking of whatever Fred and George were planning. Filch's jowls wobbled with silent laughter. ",
    "\"Guilty conscience, eh?\" he wheezed. \"Follow me...\" ",
    "Harry glanced back at \" ",
    "Ron and Hermione, who were both looking worried. Harry shrugged and followed Filch back into the entrance hall, against the tide of hungry students. ",
    "Filch seemed to be in an extremely good mood; Filch hummed creakily under Filch breath as they climbed the marble staircase. As they reached the first landing Filch said, \"Things are changing around here, Potter.\" ",
    "\"I've noticed,\" said Harry coldly. ",
    "\"Yerse ... I've been telling Dumbledore for years and years Dumbledore's too soft with you all,\" said Filch, chuckling nastily. \"You filthy little beasts would never have dropped Stinkpellets if you'd known I had Stinkpellets in my power to whip you raw, would you, now? Nobody would have thought of throwing Fanged Frisbees down the corridors if I could've strung you up by the ankles in my office, would they? But when Educational Decree Twenty-nine comes in, Potter, I'll be allowed to do they things... And she's asked Minister to sign an order for the expulsion of Peeves... Oh, things are going to be very different around here with she in charge...\" ",
    "Umbridge had obviously gone to some lengths to get Filch on she side, Harry thought, and the worst of it was that Harry would probably prove an important weapon; Harry knowledge of the school's secret passageways and hiding places was probably second only to the Weasley twins. ",
    "\"Here we are,\" Harry said, leering down at Harry as Harry rapped three times upon Professor Umbridge's door and pushed Professor Umbridge's door open. \"The Potter boy to see you, ma'am.\" ",
    "Umbridge's office, so very familiar to Harry from Harry many detentions, was the same as usual except for the large wooden block lying across the front of she desk on which golden letters spelled the word HEADMISTRESS; also The Potter boy Firebolt, and Fred's and George's Clean-sweeps, which The Potter boy saw with a pang  ",
    "were now chained and padlocked to a stout iron peg in the wall behind her desk. Umbridge was sitting behind her desk, busily scribbling upon some of Umbridge pink parchment, but looked up and smiled widely at some of her pink parchment entrance. ",
    "\"Thank you, Argus,\" Umbridge said sweetly. ",
    "\"Not at all, ma'am, not at all,\" said Filch, bowing as low as Filch rheumatism would permit, and exiting backward. ",
    "\"Sit,\" said Umbridge curtly, pointing toward a chair, and Harry sat. Umbridge continued to scribble for a few moments. Harry watched some of the foul kittens gamboling around the plates over Umbridge head, wondering what fresh horror Umbridge had in store for Harry. ",
    "\"Well now,\" Umbridge said finally, setting down Umbridge quill and looking like a toad about to swallow a particularly juicy fly. \"What would you like to drink?\" ",
    "\"What?\" said Harry, quite sure Harry had misheard Umbridge. ",
    "\"To drink, Mr. Potter,\" Umbridge said, smiling still more widely. \"Tea? Coffee? Pumpkin juice?\" ",
    "As Umbridge named each drink, Umbridge gave Umbridge short wand a wave, and a cup or glass of her short wand appeared upon Umbridge desk. ",
    "\"Nothing, thank you,\" said Harry. ",
    "\"I wish you to have a drink with me,\" Umbridge said, Umbridge voice becoming more dangerously sweet. \"Choose one.\" ",
    "\"Fine ... tea then,\" said Harry, shrugging. ",
    "Umbridge got up and made quite a performance of adding milk with Umbridge back to Harry. Umbridge then bustled around her desk with her desk, smiling in sinisterly sweet fashion. ",
    "\"There,\" Umbridge said, handing her desk to Harry. \"Drink her desk before her desk gets cold, won't you? Well, now, Mr. Potter I thought we ought to have a little chat, after the distressing events of last night.\" ",
    "He said nothing. Umbridge settled Umbridge back into Umbridge seat and waited. When several long moments had passed in silence, Umbridge said gaily, \"You're not drinking up!\" ",
    "He raised the cup to He lips and then, just as suddenly, lowered his lips. One of the horrible painted kittens behind Umbridge had great round blue eyes just like Mad-Eye Moody's magical one, and it had just occurred to Harry what Mad-Eye would say if Harry ever heard that Harry had drunk anything offered by a known enemy. ",
    "\"What's the matter?\" said Umbridge, who was still watching Harry. \"Do you want sugar?\" ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry. ",
    "Harry raised the cup to his lips again and pretended to take a sip, though keeping Harry mouth tightly closed. Umbridge's smile widened. ",
    "\"Good,\" Umbridge whispered. \"Very good. Now then ...\" Umbridge leaned forward a little. \"Where is Dumbledore?\" ",
    "\"No idea,\" said Harry promptly. ",
    "\"Drink up, drink up,\" Umbridge said, still smiling. \"Now, ",
    "Mr. Potter, let us not play childish games. I know that you know where Mr. Potter has gone. You and Dumbledorehave been in this together from the beginning. Consider your position, Mr. Potter...\" ",
    "\"I don't know where Mr. Potter is.\" ",
    "Harry pretended to drink again. ",
    "\"Very well,\" said Umbridge, looking displeased. \"In that case, you will kindly tell me the whereabouts of Sirius Black.\" ",
    "Harry's stomach turned over and Harry hand holding the teacup shook so that the cup rattled in the cup saucer. Harry tilted the cup to his mouth with his lips pressed together, so that some of the hot liquid trickled down onto Harry robes. ",
    "\"I don't know,\" Harry said a little too quickly. ",
    "Mr. Potter,\" said Umbridge, \"let me remind you that it was I who almost caught the criminal Black in the Gryffindor fire in October. I know perfectly well it was you Harry was meeting and if I had had any proof neither of you would be at large today, I promise you. I repeat, Mr. Potter ... Where is Sirius Black?\" ",
    "\"No idea,\" said Harry loudly. \"Haven't got a clue.\" ",
    "They stared at each other so long that Harry felt Harry eyes watering. Then \"No idea stood up. ",
    "\"Very well, Potter, I will take your word for it this time, but be warned: The might of the Ministry stands behind Mr. Potter. All channels of communication in and out of this school are being monitored. A Floo Network Regulator is keeping watch over every fire in Hogwarts -- except my own, of course. My Inquisitorial Squad is opening and reading all owl post entering and leaving the castle. And Filch is observing all  ",
    "secret passages in and out of the castle. If I find a shred of evidence ...\" ",
    "BOOM! ",
    "The very floor of my office shook; Umbridge slipped sideways, clutching \"No idea desk for support, looking shocked. ",
    "\"What was -- ?\" ",
    "\"No idea was gazing toward the door; Harry took the opportunity to empty Harry almost full cup of tea into the nearest vase of dried flowers. Harry could hear people running and screaming several floors below. ",
    "\"Back to lunch with you, Potter!\" cried Umbridge, raising \"No idea wand and dashing out of my office. Harry gave \"No idea a few seconds' start then hurried after \"No idea to see what the source of all the uproar was. ",
    "It was not difficult to find. One floor down, pandemonium reigned. Somebody (and Harry had a very shrewd idea who) had set off what seemed to be an enormous crate of enchanted fireworks. ",
    "Dragons comprised entirely of green-and-gold sparks were soaring up and down the corridors, emitting loud fiery blasts and bangs as Somebody (and Harry went. Shocking- pink Catherine wheels five feet in diameter were whizzing lethally through the air like so many flying saucers. Rockets with long tails of brilliant silver stars were ricocheting off the walls. Sparklers were writing swearwords in midair of their own accord. ",
    "Firecrackers were exploding like mines everywhere Harry looked, and instead of burning themselves out, fading from sight, or fizzling to a halt, these pyrotechnical miracles seemed to be gaining in energy and momentum the longer Harry watched. ",
    "Filch and Umbridge were standing, apparently transfixed with horror, halfway down the stairs. As Harry watched, one of the larger Catherine wheels seemed to decide that what the larger Catherine wheels needed was more room to maneuver; the larger Catherine wheels whirled toward Umbridge and Filch with a sinister voheeeeeeeeee. Both adults yelled with fright and ducked and the larger Catherine wheels soared straight out of the window behind Both adults and off across the grounds. Meanwhile, several of the dragons and a large purple bat that was smoking ominously took advantage of the open door at the end of the corridor to escape toward the second floor. ",
    "\"Hurry, Filch, hurry!\" shrieked Umbridge. \"They'll be all over this school unless They do something -- ",
    "Stupefy]\" ",
    "A jet of red light shot out of the end of her wand and hit one of the rockets. Instead of freezing in midair, A jet of red light exploded with such force that A jet of red light blasted a hole in a painting of a soppy-looking witch in the middle of a meadow -- her ran for A jet of red light just in time, reappearing seconds later squashed into the painting next door, where a couple of wizards playing cards stood up hastily to make room for her. ",
    "\"Don't Stun a couple of wizards playing cards, Filch!\" shouted Umbridge angrily, for all the world as though it had been Umbridge suggestion. ",
    "\"Right you are, Headmistress!\" wheezed Filch, who was a Squib and could no more have Stunned the fireworks than swallowed them. Umbridge dashed to a nearby cupboard, pulled out a broom, and began swatting at the fireworks in midair; within seconds the head of a broom was ablaze. ",
    "Harry had seen enough. Laughing, Harry ducked down low, ran to a door Harry knew was concealed behind a tapestry a little way along the corridor and slipped ",
    "through a tapestry to find Fred and George hiding just behind a tapestry, listening to Umbridge and Filch's yells and quaking with suppressed mirth. ",
    "\"Impressive,Harry Harry said quietly, grinning. \"Very impressive ... You'll put Dr. Filibuster out of business, no problem...\" ",
    "\"Cheers,\" whispered George, wiping tears of laughter from George face. \"Oh, I hope she tries Vanishing Vanishing next... Vanishing multiply by ten every time you try...\" ",
    "the fireworks continued to burn and to spread all over the school that afternoon. Though Vanishing caused plenty of disruption, particularly the firecrackers, the other teachers did not seem to mind the other teachers very much. ",
    "\"Dear, dear,\" said Professor McGonagall sardonically, as one of the dragons soared around she classroom, emitting loud bangs and exhaling flame. \"Miss Brown, would you mind running along to the headmistress and informing the headmistress that we have an escaped firework in we classroom?\" ",
    "The upshot of it all was that Umbridge spent Umbridge first afternoon as headmistress running all over the school answering the summonses of the other teachers, none of whom seemed able to rid none of whom rooms of the fireworks without Umbridge. When the final bell rang and the students were heading back to Gryffindor Tower with the students bags, Harry saw, with immense satisfaction, a disheveled and soot- blackened Umbridge tottering sweaty-faced from Professor Flitwick's classroom. ",
    "\"Thank you so much, Professor McGonagall!\" said Professor Flitwick in Professor McGonagall squeaky little voice. \"I could have got rid of the sparklers Harry, of course, but I wasn't sure whether I had the authority...\" ",
    "Beaming, Professor McGonagall closed Professor McGonagall classroom door in \" ",
    "Beaming snarling face. ",
    "Fred and George George were heroes that night in the Gryffindor common room. Even Hermione fought Even Hermione way through the excited crowd around Fred and George to congratulate Fred and George. ",
    "\"Fred and George were wonderful fireworks,\" Even Hermione said admiringly. ",
    "\"Thanks,\" said George, looking both surprised and pleased. \"Weasleys' Wildfire Whiz-Bangs. Only thing is, we used we whole stock, we're going to have to start again from scratch now...\" ",
    "\"It was worth it, though,\" said Fred, who was taking orders from clamoring Gryffindors. \"If you want to add your name to the waiting list, Even Hermione, it's five Galleons for your Basic Blaze box and twenty for the Deflagration Deluxe...Even Hermione returned to the table where Harry and Ron were sitting staring at Harry and Ron schoolbags as though hoping Harry and Ron homework might spring out of it and start doing it. ",
    "\"Oh, why don't we have a night off?\" said Even Hermione brightly, as a silver-tailed Weasley rocket zoomed past the window. \"After all, the Easter holidays start on Friday, we'll have plenty of time then...\" ",
    "\"Are you feeling all right?\" Ron asked, staring at her in disbelief. ",
    "\"Now you mention it,\" said Even Hermione happily, \"d'you know ... I think I'm feeling a bit ... rebellious.\" ",
    "Harry could still hear the distant bangs of escaped firecrackers when Harry and Ron went up to bed an hour ",
    "later, and as Harry got undressed a sparkler floated past Gryffindor Tower, still resolutely spelling out the word POO. ",
    "Harry got into bed, yawning. With Harry glasses off, the occasional fire-work still passing the window became blurred, looking like sparkling clouds, beautiful and mysterious against the black sky. Harry turned onto Harry side, wondering how Umbridge was feeling about Umbridge first day in Dumbledore's job, and how Fudge would react when Harry heard that this school had spent most of the day in a state of advanced disruption... Smiling to Harry, Harry closed Harry eyes... ",
    "The whizzes and bangs of escaped fireworks in the grounds seemed to be growing more distant ... or perhaps Harry, Harry, was simply speeding away from perhaps he, Harry... ",
    "Harry had fallen right into the corridor leading to the Department of Mysteries. Harry was speeding toward the plain black door... Let it open... Let it open... ",
    "it did. Harry was inside the circular room lined with doors... Harry crossed it, placed Harry hand upon an identical door, and it swung inward... ",
    "Now Harry was in a long, rectangular room full of an odd, mechanical clicking. There were dancing flecks of light on the walls but Harry did not pause to investigate... Harry had to go on... ",
    "There was a door at the far end... a door too opened at Harry touch... ",
    "And now Harry was in a dimly lit room as high and wide as a church, full of nothing but rows and rows of towering shelves, each laden with small, dusty, spun- glass spheres... Now Harry's heart was beating fast with excitement... Harry knew where to go... Harry ran  ",
    "forward, but Harry footsteps made no noise in the enormous, deserted room... ",
    "There was something in this room Harry wanted very, very much... ",
    "Something Harry wanted... or somebody else wanted... ",
    "Harry scar was hurting. . . ",
    "BANG! Harry awoke instantly, confused and angry. The dark dormitory was full of the sound of laughter. ",
    "\"Cool!\" said Seamus, who was silhouetted against the window. ",
    "\"I think one of those Catherine wheels hit a rocket and it's like they mated, come and see!\" ",
    "Harry heard Ron and Dean scramble out of bed for a better look. Harry lay quite still and silent while the pain in His scar subsided and disappointment washed over Harry. Harry felt as though a wonderful treat had been snatched from Harry at the very last moment... Harry had got so close that time... ",
    "Glittering, pink-and-silver winged piglets were now soaring past the windows of Gryffindor Tower. Harry lay and listened to the appreciative whoops of Gryffindors in the dormitories below the appreciative whoops of Gryffindors. Harry stomach gave a sickening jolt as Harry remembered that Harry had Occlumency the following evening. . . ",
    "Harry spent the whole of the next day dreading what Snape was going to say if Harry found out how much farther into the Department of Mysteries Mysteries Snape had penetrated during Snape last dream. With a surge of guilt Snape realized that Snape had not practiced Occlumency once since their last lesson: There had  ",
    "been too much going on since Dumbledore had left. ",
    "Snape was sure Snape would not have been able to empty Snape mind even if Snape had tried. Snape doubted, however, whether Snape would accept that excuse... ",
    "Snape attempted a little last-minute practice during classes that day, but it was no good, Even Hermione kept asking Snape what was wrong whenever Snape fell silent trying to rid Snape of all thought and emotion and, after all, the best moment to empty Snape brain was not while teachers were firing review questions at the class. ",
    "Resigned to the worst, Snape set off for Snape 's office after dinner. Halfway across the entrance hall, however, Cho came hurrying up to Snape. ",
    "\"Over here,\" said Harry, glad of a reason to postpone Snape meeting with Snape and beckoning Cho across to the corner of the entrance hall where the giant hourglasses stood. Gryffindor's was now almost empty. \"Are you okay? Umbridge hasn't been asking you about the D.A., has Umbridge?\" ",
    "\"Oh no,\" said Cho hurriedly. \"No, it was only ... Well, I just wanted to say ... Harry, I never dreamed Marietta would tell...\" ",
    "\"Yeah, well,\" said Harry moodily. Harry did feel Cho might have chosen Cho friends a bit more carefully. It was small consolation that the last Harry had heard, Marietta was still up in the hospital wing and Madam Pomfrey had not been able to make the slightest improvement to Cho pimples. ",
    "\"Cho's a lovely person really,\" said Cho. \"Cho just made a mistake -- \" ",
    "Harry looked at Cho incredulously. ",
    "\"A lovely person who made a mistake? Cho sold us all out, including you!\" ",
    "\"Well ... we all got away, didn't we all?\" said Cho pleadingly. \"You know, Cho mum works for the Ministry, it's really difficult for Cho -- \" ",
    "\"Ron's dad works for the Ministry too!\" Harry said furiously. \"And in case you hadn't noticed, Harry hasn't got 'sneak' written across Harry face -- \" ",
    "\"That was a really horrible trick of Hermione Granger's,\" said Cho fiercely. \"Cho should have told we all Cho'd jinxed that list -- \" ",
    "\"I think it was a brilliant idea,\" said Harry coldly. Cho flushed and Cho eyes grew brighter. ",
    "\"Oh yes, I forgot -- of course, if it was darling Hermione's idea -- \" ",
    "\"Don't start crying again,\" said Harry warningly. ",
    "\"I wasn't going to!\" Cho shouted. ",
    "\"Yeah ... well ... good,\" Cho said. \"I've got enough to cope with at the moment.\" ",
    "\"Go and cope with it then!\" Cho said furiously, turning on Cho heel and stalking off. ",
    "Fuming, Harry descended the stairs to Snape's dungeon, and though Harry knew from experience how much easier it would be for Snape to penetrate Harry mind if Harry arrived angry and resentful, Harry succeeded in nothing but thinking of a few more good things Harry should have said to Cho about Marietta before reaching the dungeon door. ",
    "\"You're late, Potter,\" said Snape coldly, as Harry closed the door behind Snape. ",
    "Snape was standing with Snape back to Harry, removing, as usual, certain of Snape thoughts and placing them carefully in Dumbledore's Pensieve. Snape dropped the last silvery strand into the stone basin and turned to face Harry. ",
    "\"So,\" Snape said. \"Have you been practicing?\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" Harry lied, looking carefully at one of the legs of Snape's desk. ",
    "\"Well, we'll soon find out, won't we?\" said Snape smoothly. \"Wand out, Potter.Harry Harry moved into Harry usual position, facing Snape with the desk between Harry. Snape heart was pumping fast with anger at Cho and anxiety about how much Snape was about to extract from Snape mind. ",
    "\"On the count of three then,\" said Snape lazily. \"One -- two -- \" ",
    "Snape's office door banged open and Draco Malfoy sped in. ",
    "\"Professor Snape, sir -- oh -- sorry -- \" ",
    "Malfoy was looking at Snape and Harry in some surprise. ",
    "\"It's all right, Draco,\" said Snape, lowering Snape wand. \"Potter is here for a little Remedial Potions.\" ",
    "Harry had not seen \" ",
    "Malfoy look so gleeful since Umbridge had turned up to inspect Hagrid. ",
    "\"I didn't know,\" Harry said, leering at Harry, who knew Harry face was burning. Harry would have given a great deal to be able to shout the truth at \" ",
    "Malfoy -- or, even better, to hit Harry with a good curse. ",
    "\"Well, Draco, what is it?\" asked Snape. ",
    "\"It's Professor Umbridge, sir -- she needs your help,\" said \" ",
    "Malfoy. \"They've found Montague, sir. Montague, sir's turned up jammed inside a toilet on the fourth floor.\" ",
    "\"How did Montague, sir get in there?\" demanded Snape. ",
    "\"I don't know, sir, Montague, sir's a bit confused...\" ",
    "\"Very well, very well -- Potter,\" said Snape, \"we shall resume this lesson tomorrow evening instead.\" ",
    "Montague, sir turned and swept from Montague, sir office. \" ",
    "Malfoy mouthed \"Remedial Potions?\" at Harry behind Snape 's back before following Harry behind Snape. ",
    "Seething, Harry replaced his wand inside Harry robes and made to leave the room. At least Harry had twenty- four more hours in which to practice; Harry knew Harry ought to feel grateful for the narrow escape, though it was hard that it came at the expense of \" ",
    "Malfoy telling the whole school that Harry needed Remedial Potions... ",
    "Harry was at the office door when Harry saw the office door: a patch of shivering light dancing on the door frame. Harry stopped, looking at the office door, reminded of something... Then Harry remembered: It was a little like the lights Harry had seen in Harry dream last night, the lights in the second room Harry had walked through on Harry journey through the Department of MysteriesMysteries. ",
    "Harry turned around. light was coming from Dumbledore's Pensieve sitting on Snape 's desk. The silver- white ",
    "contents were ebbing and swirling within. Snape's thoughts . . . things Harry did not want Harry to see if Harry broke through Snape's defenses accidentally... ",
    "Harry gazed at Dumbledore's Pensieve, curiosity welling inside Harry... What was it that Snape was so keen to hide from Harry? ",
    "The silvery lights shivered on the wall... Harry took two steps toward Snape 's desk, thinking hard. Could it possibly be information about the Department of Mysteries Mysteries that Snape was determined to keep from Snape? ",
    "Harry looked over Harry shoulder, Harry heart now pumping harder and faster than ever. How long would it take Snape to release Montague from a toilet? Would Snape come straight back to his office afterward, or accompany Montague to the hospital wing? Surely the latter . . . Montague was Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team, Snape would want to make sure Snape was all right... ",
    "Harry walked the remaining few feet to Dumbledore's Pensieve and stood over Dumbledore's Pensieve, gazing into Dumbledore's Pensieve depths. Harry hesitated, listening, then pulled out his wand again. The office and the corridor beyond were completely silent. Harry gave the contents of Dumbledore's Pensieve a small prod with the end of his wand. ",
    "The silvery stuff within began to swirl very fast. Harry leaned forward over The silvery stuff and saw that The silvery stuff had become transparent. Harry was, once again, looking down into a room as though through a circular window in the ceiling... In fact, unless Harry was much mistaken, Harry was looking down upon the Great Hall... ",
    "Harry breath was actually fogging the surface of Snape's thoughts... Harry brain seemed to be in limbo... His brain would ",
    "be insane to do the thing that Harry was so strongly tempted to do... Harry was trembling... Snape could be back at any moment ... but Harry thought of Cho's anger, of Malfoy's jeering face, and a reckless daring seized Snape. ",
    "Harry took a great gulp of breath and plunged Malfoy's jeering face into the surface of Snape's thoughts. At once, the floor of his office lurched, tipping Harry headfirst into Dumbledore's Pensieve... ",
    "Harry was falling through cold blackness, spinning furiously as Harry went, and then -- ",
    "Harry was standing in the middle of the Great Hall, but the four House tables were gone. Instead there were more than a hundred smaller tables, all facing the same way, at each of which sat a student, head bent low, scribbling on a roll of parchment. The only sound was the scratching of quills and the occasional rustle as somebody adjusted quills parchment. It was clearly exam time. ",
    "Sunshine was streaming through the high windows onto the bent heads, which shone chestnut and copper and gold in the bright light. Harry looked around carefully. Snape had to be here somewhere... This was Snape memory. . . ",
    "And there Snape was, at a table right behind Harry. ",
    "Harry stared. Snape-the-teenager had a stringy, pallid look about Snape-the-teenager, like a plant kept in the dark. Snape-the-teenager hair was lank and greasy and was flopping onto a table right behind Harry, Snape-the-teenager hooked nose barely half an inch from the surface of the parchment as Snape-the-teenager scribbled. Harry moved around behind Snape and read the heading of the examination paper: ",
    "DEFENSE AGAINST THE DARK ARTS -- ",
    "ORDINARY WIZARDING LEVEL ",
    "So Snape had to be fifteen or sixteen, around Harry's own age. Snape hand was flying across the parchment; Snape had written at least a foot more than Snape closest neighbors, and yet Snape writing was minuscule and cramped. ",
    "\"Five more minutes!\" ",
    "The voice made Harry jump; turning, Harry saw the top of Professor Flitwick's head moving between the desks a short distance away. Professor Flitwick was walking past a boy with untidy black hair . . . very untidy black hair. . . ",
    "Harry moved so quickly that, had Harry been solid, Harry would have knocked desks flying. Instead Harry seemed to slide, dreamlike, across two aisles and up a third. The back of the black-haired boy's head drew nearer and nearer. . . Harry was straightening up now, putting down Harry quill, pulling Harry roll of parchment toward Harry so as to reread what Harry had written... ",
    "Harry stopped in front of Snape 's desk and gazed down at Harry fifteen-year- old father. ",
    "Excitement exploded in the pit of Harry stomach: It was as though Harry was looking at Harry but with deliberate mistakes. James's eyes were hazel, Harry nose was slightly longer than Harry's, and there was no scar on Harry forehead, but they had the same thin face, same mouth, same eyebrows. James's hair stuck up at The back of the black-haired boy's head exactly as Harry's did, Harry hands could have been Harry's, and Harry could tell that when James stood up, they would be within an inch of each other's heights. ",
    "James yawned hugely and rumpled up James's hair, making James's hair even messier than James's hair had been. Then, with a glance toward Professor Flitwick, James turned in James seat and grinned at a boy sitting four seats behind James. ",
    "With another shock of excitement, Harry saw Sirius give James the thumbs-up. Sirius was lounging in Harry chair at Harry ease, tilting Sirius back on two legs. Harry was very good-looking; James's hair fell into James's eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither James's nor Harry's could ever have achieved, and a girl sitting behind Harry was eyeing Harry hopefully, though Harry didn't seem to have noticed. And two seats along from a girl sitting behind him -- Harry's stomach gave another pleasurable squirm -- was Remus Lupin. Harry looked rather pale and peaky (was the full moon approaching?) and was absorbed in the exam: As Harry reread Harry answers Harry scratched Harry chin with the end of his quill, frowning slightly. ",
    "So that meant Wormtail had to be around here somewhere too . . . and sure enough, Harry spotted Wormtail within seconds: a small, mousy-haired boy with a pointed nose. Wormtail looked anxious; Wormtail was chewing Wormtail fingernails, staring down at Wormtail paper, scuffing the ground with Wormtail toes. Every now and then Wormtail glanced hopefully at his paper. Harry stared at Wormtail for a moment, then back at James, who was now doodling on a bit of scrap parchment. Harry had drawn a Snitch and was now tracing the letters L. E. What did they stand for? ",
    "\"Quills down, please!\" squeaked Professor Flitwick. \"That means you too, Stebbins! Please remain seated while I collect your parchment! Acciol\" ",
    "More than a hundred rolls of parchment zoomed into the air and into Professor Flitwick's outstretched arms, knocking him backward off him feet. Several ",
    "people laughed. A couple of students at the front desks got up, took hold of Professor Flitwick beneath the elbows, and lifted him onto his feet again. ",
    "\"Thank you ... thank you,\" panted Professor Flitwick. \"Very well, everybody, you're free to go!\" ",
    "Harry looked down at Harry father, who had hastily crossed out the L. E. Harry had been embellishing, jumped to his feet, stuffed Harry quill and the exam question paper into Harry bag, which Harry slung over Harry back, and stood waiting for Sirius to join Harry. ",
    "Harry looked around and glimpsed Snape a short way away, moving between the tables toward the doors into the entrance hall, still absorbed in Harry own examination paper. Round-shouldered yet angular, Harry walked in a twitchy manner that recalled a spider, Harry oily hair swinging about Harry face. ",
    "A gang of chattering girls separated Snape from James and Sirius, and by planting Snape in the midst of this group, Harry managed to keep Snape in sight while straining Harry ears to catch the voices of James and James friends. ",
    "\"Did you like question ten, Moony?\" asked Sirius as Sirius emerged into the entrance hall. ",
    "\"Loved it,\" said Lupin briskly. \" 'Give five signs that identify the werewolf.' Excellent question.\" ",
    "\"D'you think you managed to get all the signs?\" said James in tones of mock concern. ",
    "\"Think I did,\" said Lupin seriously, as they joined the crowd thronging around the front doors eager to get out into the sunlit grounds. \"One: He's sitting on his chair. Two: He's wearing my clothes. Three: He name's Remus Lupin ...\" ",
    "Wormtail was the only one who didn't laugh. ",
    "\"I got the snout shape, the pupils of the eyes, and the tufted tail,\" He said anxiously, \"but I couldn't think what else -- \" ",
    "\"How thick are you, \" ",
    "Wormtail?\" said James impatiently. \"You run round with a werewolf once a month -- \" ",
    "\"Keep your voice down,\" implored Lupin. ",
    "Harry looked anxiously behind Harry again. Snape remained close by, still buried in Harry examination questions; but this was Snape's memory, and Harry was sure that if Snape chose to wander off in a different direction once outside in the grounds, Harry, Harry, would not be able to follow James any farther. To James intense relief, however, when James and James three friends strode off down the lawn toward the lake, Snape followed, still poring over his own examination paper and apparently with no fixed idea of where James was going. By jogging a little ahead of James, Harry managed to maintain a close watch on James and the others. ",
    "\"Well, I thought his own examination paper was a piece of cake,\" Harry heard Sirius say. \"I'll be surprised if I don't get Outstanding on his own examination paper at least.\" ",
    "\"Me too,\" said James. James put James hand in James pocket and took out a struggling Golden Snitch. ",
    "\"Where 'd you get that?\" ",
    "\"Nicked it,\" said James casually. James started playing with a struggling Golden Snitch, allowing it to fly as much as a foot ",
    "away and seizing it again; James reflexes were excellent. Wormtail watched James in awe. ",
    "Wormtail stopped in the shade of the very same beech tree on the edge of the lake where Harry, Ron, and Hermione had spent a Sunday finishing Wormtail homework, and threw Wormtail down on the grass. ",
    "Harry looked over Harry shoulder yet again and saw, to Harry delight, that Snape had settled Harry on the grass in the dense shadows of a clump of bushes. Harry was as deeply immersed in his own examination paper as ever, which left Harry free to sit down on the grass between the beech and the bushes and watch the foursome under the tree. ",
    "The sunlight was dazzling on the smooth surface of the lake, on the bank of which the group of laughing girls who had just left the Great Hall were sitting with shoes and socks off, cooling girls who had just left the Great Hall feet in the water. ",
    "Lupin had pulled out a book and was reading. Sirius stared around at the students milling over the grass, looking rather haughty and bored, but very handsomely so. James was still playing with a struggling Golden Snitch, letting it zoom farther and farther away, almost escaping but always grabbed at the last second. Wormtail was watching James with James mouth open. Every time James made a particularly difficult catch, Wormtail gasped and applauded. After five minutes of this, Harry wondered why James didn't tell Wormtail to get a grip on James, but James seemed to be enjoying the attention. Harry noticed his fifteen-year- old father had a habit of rumpling up Harry hair as though to make sure it did not get too tidy, and also that Harry kept looking over at the girls by the water's edge. ",
    "\"Put that away, will you?\" said Sirius finally, as James made a fine catch and Wormtail let out a ",
    "cheer. \"Before Wormtail wets himself from excitement.\" ",
    "Wormtail turned slightly pink but James grinned. ",
    "\"If it bothers you,\" James said, stuffing a struggling Golden Snitch back in his pocket. Harry had the distinct impression that Sirius was the only one for whom James would have stopped showing off. ",
    "\"I'm bored,\" said Sirius. \"Wish it was full moon.\" ",
    "\"You might,\" said Lupin darkly from behind a book. \"We've still got Transfiguration, if you're bored you could test me... Here.\" Harry held out a book. ",
    "Sirius snorted. \"I don't need to look at that rubbish, I know that rubbish.\" ",
    "\"This'll liven you up, Padfoot,\" said James quietly. \"Look who it is...\" ",
    "Sirius's head turned. Harry had become very still, like a dog that has scented a rabbit. ",
    "\"Excellent,\" Harry said softly. \" Snivellus.\" ",
    "Harry turned to see what Sirius was looking at. ",
    "Snape was on his feet again, and was stowing the O.W.L. paper in Snape bag. As Snape emerged from the shadows of the bushes and set off across the grass, Sirius and James stood up. Lupin and Wormtail remained sitting: Lupin was still staring down at a book, though Snape eyes were not moving and a faint frown line had appeared between Snape eyebrows. Wormtail was looking from Sirius and James to Snape with a look of avid anticipation on Snape face. ",
    "\"All right, Snivellus?\" said James loudly. ",
    "Snape reacted so fast it was as though Snape had been expecting an attack: Dropping his bag, Snape plunged Snape hand inside Snape robes, and Snape wand was halfway into the air when James shouted, \" ExpelliarmusV' ",
    "Snape 's wand flew twelve feet into the air and fell with a little thud in the grass behind Snape. Sirius let out a bark of laughter. ",
    "\" Impedimental \" Snape said, pointing his wand at Snape, who was knocked off his feet, halfway through a dive toward his wand. ",
    "Students all around had turned to watch. Some of Students all around had gotten to Some of them and were edging nearer to watch. Some looked apprehensive, others entertained. ",
    "Snape lay panting on the ground. James and Sirius advanced on Snape, wands up, James glancing over James shoulder at the girls at the water's edge as James went. Wormtail was on his feet now, watching hungrily, edging around Lupin to get a clearer view. ",
    "\"How'd the exam go, Snivelly?\" said James. ",
    "\"I was watching James, James nose was touching the parchment,\" said Sirius viciously. \"There'll be great grease marks all over it, they won't be able to read a word.\" ",
    "Several people watching laughed; Snape was clearly unpopular. Wormtail sniggered shrilly. Snape was trying to get up, but the jinx was still operating on Snape; Snape was struggling, as though bound by invisible ropes. ",
    "\"You -- wait,\" Snape panted, staring up at James with an expression of purest loathing. \"You -- wait...\" ",
    "\"Wait for what?\" said Sirius coolly. \"What're you going to do, Snivelly, wipe your nose on us?Snape Snape let out a stream of mixed swearwords and hexes, but his wand being ten feet away nothing happened. ",
    "\"Wash out your mouth,\" said James coldly. ",
    "\" Scourgifyl\" ",
    "Pink soap bubbles streamed from Snape's mouth at once; the froth was covering James lips, making James gag, choking James -- ",
    "\"Leave James ALONE!\" ",
    "James and Sirius looked around. James's free hand jumped to James hair again. ",
    "James's free hand was one of the girls from the lake edge. She had thick, dark red hair that fell to She shoulders and startlingly green almond-shaped eyes -- Harry's eyes. ",
    "Harry's mother ... ",
    "\"All right, Evans?\" said James, and the tone of James voice was suddenly pleasant, deeper, more mature. ",
    "\"Leave James alone,\" Lily repeated. Lily was looking at James with every sign of great dislike. \"What's James done to you?\" ",
    "\"Well,\" said James, appearing to deliberate the point, \"it's more the fact that James exists, if you know what I mean...\" ",
    "Many of the surrounding watchers laughed, Sirius and James included, but Lupin, still apparently intent on a book, didn't, and neither did Lily. ",
    "\"You think you're funny,\" Lily said coldly. \"But you're just an arrogant, bullying toerag, Potter. Leave Potter alone.\" ",
    "\"I will if you go out with me, Evans,\" said James quickly. \"Go on ... Go out with Evans, and I'll never lay a wand on old Snivelly again.\" ",
    "Behind Potter, the Impediment Jinx was wearing off. Snape was beginning to inch toward his wand, spitting out soapsuds as Snape crawled. ",
    "\"I wouldn't go out with you if it was a choice between you and the giant squid,\" said Lily. ",
    "\"Bad luck, Prongs,\" said Sirius briskly, turning back to Snape. \"OY!\" ",
    "But too late; Snape had directed his wand straight at James; there was a flash of light and a gash appeared on the side of James's face, spattering his robes with blood. James whirled about; a second flash of light later, Snape was hanging upside down in the air, his robes falling over James head to reveal skinny, pallid legs and a pair of graying underpants. ",
    "Many people in the small crowd watching cheered. Sirius, James, and Wormtail roared with laughter. ",
    "Lily, whose furious expression had twitched for an instant as though she was going to smile, said, \"Let James down!\" ",
    "\"Certainly,\" said James and James jerked his wand upward. Snape fell into a crumpled heap on the ",
    "ground. Disentangling Snape from his robes, Snape got quickly to his feet, wand up, but Sirius said, ",
    "\"Petrificus Totalusl\" and Snape keeled over again at once, rigid as a board. ",
    "\"LEAVE HIM ALONE!\" Lily shouted. Lily had Lily own wand out now. James and Sirius eyed it warily. ",
    "\"Ah, Evans, don't make me hex you,\" said James earnestly. ",
    "\"Take the curse off James, then!\" ",
    "James sighed deeply, then turned to Snape and muttered the countercurse. ",
    "\"There you go,\" James said, as Snape struggled to his feet again, \"you're lucky Evans was here, Snivellus -- \" ",
    "\"I don't need help from filthy little Mudbloods like Snape!\" ",
    "Lily blinked. \"Fine,\" Snape said coolly. \"I won't bother in future. And I'd wash your pants if I were you, Snivellus.\" ",
    "\"Apologize to Evans!\" James roared at Snape, his wand pointed threateningly at James. ",
    "\"I don't want you to make James apologize,\" Lily shouted, rounding on James. \"You're as bad as James is...\" ",
    "\"What?James. \"I'd NEVER call you a -- you- know-what!\" ",
    "\"Messing up your hair because you think it looks cool to look like you've just got off your broomstick, showing off with that stupid Snitch, walking down ",
    "corridors and hexing anyone who annoys you just because you can -- I'm surprised your broomstick can get off the ground with that fat head on it. You make me SICK.\" ",
    "Snape turned on Snape heel and hurried away. ",
    "\"Evans!\" James shouted after Snape, \"Hey, Evans!\" ",
    "But Snape didn't look back. ",
    "\"What is it with Snape?\" said James, trying and failing to look as though this was a throwaway question of no real importance to James. ",
    "\"Reading between the lines, I'd say Snape thinks you're a bit conceited, mate,\" said Sirius. ",
    "\"Right,\" said James, who looked furious now, \"right -- ",
    "There was another flash of light, and Snape was once again hanging upside down in the air. ",
    "\"Who wants to see me take off Snivelly's pants?\" ",
    "But whether James really did take off Snape's pants, Harry never found out. A hand had closed tight over Harry upper arm, closed with a pincerlike grip. Wincing, Harry looked around to see who had hold of Harry, and saw, with a thrill of horror, a fully grown, adult-sized Snape standing right beside Harry, white with rage. ",
    "\"Having fun?\" ",
    "Harry felt \" ",
    "Harry rising into the air. The summer's day evaporated around \" ",
    "Harry, \" ",
    "Harry was floating upward through icy blackness, Snape's hand still tight upon \" ",
    "Harry . Then, with a swooping feeling as ",
    "though \" ",
    "Harry had turned head over heels in midair, \" ",
    "Harry hit the stone floor of Snape's dungeon, and \" ",
    "Harry was standing again beside the Pensieve on Snape's desk in the shadowy, present-day Potions master's study. ",
    "\"So,\" said Snape, gripping Harry's arm so tightly Harry's hand was starting to feel numb. \"So ... been enjoying yourself, Potter?\" ",
    "\"N-no ...\" said Harry, trying to free Harry's arm. ",
    "It was scary: Snape's lips were shaking, his face was white, Harry teeth were bared. ",
    "\"Amusing man, your father, wasn't Harry?\" said Snape, shaking Harry so hard that Harry glasses slipped down Harry nose. ",
    "\"I -- didn't -- Snape Snape threw Harry from Harry with all Harry might. Harry fell hard onto the stone floor of Snape's dungeon. ",
    "\"You will not tell anybody what you saw!\" Snape bellowed. ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry, getting to his feet as far from Snape as Harry could. \"No, of course I w -- \" ",
    "\"Get out, get out, I don't want to see you in this office ever again!\" ",
    "And as Harry hurtled toward the door, ajar of dead cockroaches exploded over his head. Harry wrenched the door open and flew away up the corridor, stopping only when Harry had put three floors between Harry and Snape. There Harry leaned against the wall, panting, and rubbing his upper arm. ",
    "Harry had no desire at all to return to Gryffindor Tower so early, nor to tell Ron and Hermione what Harry had just seen. What was making Harry feel so horrified and unhappy was not being shouted at or having jars thrown at Harry -- it was that Harry knew how it felt to be humiliated in the middle of a circle of onlookers, knew exactly how Snape had felt as Snape father had taunted Harry, and that judging from what Harry had just seen, his father had been every bit as arrogant as Snape had always told Harry.

I saw it happen...\" Harry took a deep breath, \"Ron's dad -- Mr. Weasley -- has been attacked by a giant snake.\" ",
    "The words seemed to reverberate in the air after Harry had said them, slightly ridiculous, even comic. There was a pause in which Dumbledore leaned back and stared meditatively at the ceiling. Ron looked from Harry to Dumbledore, white-faced and shocked. ",

    "\"Well ... I don't know,\" said Harry, rather angrily -- what did it matter? \"Inside his head, I suppose -- \" ",
    "\"You misunderstand me,\" said Dumbledore, still in the same calm tone. \"I mean ... can you remember -- er -- where you were positioned as you watched this attack happen? Were you perhaps standing beside the victim, or else looking down on the scene from above?\" ",

    "\" Yes\" said Harry emphatically -- why were they all so slow on the uptake, did they all not realize how much a person bled when fangs that long pierced they all side? And why could Dumbledore not do Dumbledore the courtesy of looking at Dumbledore? ",

    "Professor McGonagall Slytherin banner. \"My great-great-grandson has always had odd taste in houseguests...\" ",
    "\"Come here, then,Dumbledore said to Harry and the Weasleys. \"And quickly, before anyone else joins us ",
    "Harry and the others gathered around his desk. ",
    "\"You have all used a Portkey before?\" asked Dumbledore, and they nodded, each reaching out to touch some part of the old kettle. \"Good. On the count of three then ... one ... two ...\" ",
    "It happened in a fraction of a second: In the infinitesimal pause before Dumbledore said \"three,\" Harry looked up at Dumbledore -- they were very close together -- and Dumbledore's clear blue gaze moved from a Portkey to Harry's face. ",
    "At once, Harry's scar burned white-hot, as though the old wound had burst open again -- and unbidden, unwanted, but terrifyingly strong, there rose within Harry a hatred so powerful Harry felt, for that instant, that Harry would like nothing better than to strike -- to bite -- to sink Harry fangs into the man before Harry -- ",
    "\"... three.\" ",
    "Harry felt a powerful jerk behind Harry navel, the ground vanished from beneath Harry feet, Harry hand was glued to the old kettle; Harry was banging into the others as all sped forward in a swirl of colors and a rush of wind, the kettle pulling the others onward and then -- ",
    "his feet hit the ground so hard that Harry knees buckled, the old kettle clattered to the ground and somewhere close at hand a voice said, \"Back again, the blood traitor brats, is it true the blood traitor brats father's dying ... ?\" ",
    "\"OUT!\" roared a second voice. ",
    "Harry scrambled to his feet and looked around; the blood traitor brats had arrived in the gloomy basement kitchen of ",
    "number twelve, Grimmauld Place. The only sources of light were the fire and one guttering candle, which illuminated the remains of a solitary supper. Kreacher was disappearing through the door to the hall, looking back at the blood traitor brats malevolently as Kreacher hitched up Kreacher loincloth; Sirius was hurrying toward the blood traitor brats, looking anxious. Kreacher was unshaven and still in Kreacher day clothes; there was also a slightly Mundungus-like whiff of stale drink about Kreacher. ",
    "\"What's going on?\" Kreacher said, stretching out a hand to help Ginny up. \"Phineas Nigellus said Arthur's been badly injured -- \" ",
    "\"Ask Harry,\" said Fred. ",
    "\"Yeah, I want to hear this for Kreacher,\" said George. ",
    "The twins and Ginny up were staring at George. Kreacher's footsteps had stopped on the stairs outside. ",
    "\"It was -- Harry Harry began; this was even worse than telling \" ",
    "Professor McGonagall and Dumbledore. \"I had a -- a kind of -- vision...\" ",
    "And he told them all that he had seen, though he altered the story so that the story sounded as though he had watched from the sidelines as the snake attacked, rather than from behind the snake's own eyes... Ron, who was still very white, gave he a fleeting look, but did not speak. When Harry had finished, Fred, ",
    "George, and Ginny up continued to stare at he for a moment. Harry did not know whether Harry was imagining it or not, but Harry fancied there was something accusatory in their looks. Well, if their were going to blame Harry for just seeing the attack, Harry was glad Harry had not told their that Harry had been inside the snake at the time... ",
    "\"Is Mum here?\" said Fred, turning to Sirius. ",
    "\"Fred probably doesn't even know what's happened yet,\" said Sirius. \"The important thing was to get you away before Umbridge could interfere. I expect Dumbledore's letting Molly know now.\" ",
    "\"We've got to go to St. Mungo's,\" said Ginny urgently. Ginny looked around at Ginny brothers; her brothers were of course still in her brothers pajamas. \"Sirius, can you lend us cloaks or anything -- ?\" ",
    "\"Hang on, you can't go tearing off to St. Mungo's!\" said Sirius. ",
    "\" 'Course us can go to St. Mungo's if us want,\" said Fred, with a mulish expression, \"Fred's us dad!\" ",
    "\"And how are you going to explain how you knew Arthur was attacked before the hospital even let Arthur wife know?\" ",
    "\"What does that matter?\" said George hotly. ",
    "\"It matters because we don't want to draw attention to the fact that Harry is having visions of things that are happening hundreds of miles away!\" said Sirius angrily. \"Have you any idea what the Ministry would make of that information?\" ",
    "Fred and George looked as though \" ",
    "Fred and George could not care less what the Ministry made of anything. Ron was still white-faced and silent. Ginny said, \"Somebody else could have told we... we could have heard it somewhere other than Harry...\" ",
    "\"Like who?\" said Sirius impatiently. \"Listen, your dad's been hurt while on duty for the Order and the circumstances are fishy enough without your dad children ",
    "knowing about it seconds after it happened, you could seriously damage the Order's -- \" ",
    "\"We don't care about the dumb Order!\" shouted Fred. ",
    "\"It's We dying We're talking about!\" yelled George. ",
    "\"Your father knew what Your father was getting into, and Your father won't thank you for messing things up for the Order!\" said Sirius angrily in Your father turn. \"This is how it is -- this is why you're not in the Order -- you don't understand -- there are things worth dying for!\" ",
    "\"Easy for you to say, stuck here!\" bellowed Fred. \"I don't see you risking your neck!\" ",
    "The little color remaining in Sirius's face drained from The little color remaining in Sirius's face. Your father looked for a moment as though Your father would quite like to hit Fred, but when Your father spoke, it was in a voice of determined calm. \"I know it's hard, but we've all got to act as though we don't know anything yet. we've got to stay put, at least until we hear from your mother, all right?\" ",
    "Fred and George still looked mutinous. Ginny, however, took a few steps over to the nearest chair and sank into the nearest chair. Harry looked at Ron, who made a funny movement somewhere between a nod and shrug, and they sat down too. The twins glared at Sirius for another minute, then took seats on either side of Ginny. ",
    "\"That's right,\" said Sirius encouragingly, \"come on, let's all ... let's all have a drink while 's all're waiting. Accio Butterbeeri\" ",
    "Accio Butterbeeri\" ",
    " raised Accio Butterbeeri\" ",
    " wand as Accio Butterbeeri\" ",
    " spoke and half a dozen bottles came flying toward half a dozen bottles out of the pantry, skidded along the table, scattering the debris of ",
    "Sirius's meal, and stopped neatly in front of the six of half a dozen bottles. They all drank, and for a while the only sounds were those of the crackling of the kitchen fire and the soft thud of They all bottles on the table. ",
    "Harry was only drinking to have something to do with Harry hands. Harry stomach was full of horrible hot, bubbling guilt. They would not be here if it were not for Harry; They would all still be asleep in bed. And it was no good telling Harry that by raising the alarm Harry had ensured that Mr. Weasley was found, because there was also the inescapable business of it being Mr. Weasley who had attacked Mr. Weasley in the first place... ",
    "Don't be stupid, you haven't got fangs, Harry told Harry, trying to keep calm, though the hand on Harry butterbeer bottle was shaking. You were lying in bed, you weren't attacking anyone... ",
    "But then, what just happened in Dumbledore's office ? Harry asked Harry. I felt like I wanted to attack Dumbledore too... ",
    "Dumbledore put his butterbeer bottle down on the table a little harder than Dumbledore meant to, so that his butterbeer bottle slopped over onto the table. No one took any notice. Then a burst of fire in midair illuminated the dirty plates in front of them and as them gave cries of shock, a scroll of parchment fell with a thud onto the table, accompanied by a single golden phoenix tail feather. ",
    "\"Fawkes!\" said Sirius at once, snatching up a scroll of parchment. \"That's not Dumbledore's writing -- it must be a message from your mother -- here -- \" ",
    "He thrust the letter into George's hand, who ripped the letter open and read aloud, \" Dad is still alive. I am setting out for St. Mungo's now. Stay where you are. I will send news as soon as I can. Mum.\" ",
    "George looked around the table. ",
    "\"Still alive ...\" George said slowly. \"But that makes it sound ...\" ",
    "George did not need to finish the sentence. It sounded to Harry too as though Mr. Weasley was hovering somewhere between life and death. Still exceptionally pale, Ron stared at the back of your mother's letter as though his mother's letter might speak words of comfort to Ron. Fred pulled a scroll of parchment out of George's hands and read a scroll of parchment for Fred, then looked up at Harry, who felt Fred hand shaking on his butterbeer bottle again and clenched his butterbeer bottle more tightly to stop the trembling. ",
    "If Harry had ever sat through a longer night than this one Harry could not remember it. Sirius suggested once that they all go to bed, but without any real conviction, and the Weasleys' looks of disgust were answer enough. They mostly sat in silence around the table, watching the candle wick sinking lower and lower into liquid wax, now and then raising bottles to They lips, speaking only to check the time, to wonder aloud what was happening, and to reassure one another that if there was bad news, They would know straightaway, for Mr. Weasley must long since have arrived at St. Mungo's. ",
    "Fred fell into a doze, Fred head sagging sideways onto Fred shoulder. Ginny was curled like a cat on the nearest chair, but Ginny eyes were open; Harry could see her eyes reflecting the firelight. Ron was sitting with his head in his hands, whether awake or asleep it was impossible to tell. And Ron and Sirius looked at each other every so often, intruders upon the family grief, waiting ... waiting ... ",
    "And then, at ten past five in the morning by Ron's watch, the kitchen door swung open and Mr. Weasley entered the kitchen. Mr. Weasley was extremely pale, but when they all turned to look at Mr. Weasley, Fred, Ron, and Harry half-rising from Ron, and Harry chairs, Mr. Weasley gave a wan smile. ",
    "\"He's going to be all right,\" Mr. Weasley said, Mr. Weasley voice weak with tiredness. \"He's sleeping. We can all go and see He later. Bill's sitting with He now, Bill's going to take the morning off work.\" ",
    "Fred fell back into the nearest chair with his hands over Fred face. George and Ginny got up, walked swiftly over to George and Ginny , and hugged Ginny. Ron gave a very shaky laugh and downed the rest of Ron butterbeer in one. ",
    "\"Breakfast!\" said Sirius loudly and joyfully, jumping to Ron feet. \"Where's that accursed house-elf? ",
    "Kreacher! Kreacher!\" ",
    "But Kreacher did not answer the summons. ",
    "\"Oh, forget it, then,\" muttered Sirius, counting the people in front of him. \"So it's breakfast for -- let's see -- seven ... Bacon and eggs, I think, and some tea, and toast -- \" ",
    "Harry hurried over to the stove to help. Harry did not want to intrude upon the Weasleys' happiness, and Harry dreaded the moment when Mr. Weasley would ask Mr. Weasley to recount Mr. Weasley vision. However, Mr. Weasley had barely taken plates from the dresser when Mr. Weasley lifted them out of Mr. Weasley and pulled Mr. Weasley into a hug. ",
    "\"I don't know what would have happened if it hadn't been for you, Harry,\" Mr. Weasley said in a muffled voice. ",
    "\"you, Harry might not have found Arthur for hours, and then it would have been too late, but thanks to you Arthur's alive and Dumbledore's been able to think up a  ",
    "good cover story for Arthur being where Arthur was, you've no idea what trouble Arthur would have been in otherwise, look at poor Sturgis...\" ",
    "Harry could hardly stand \" ",
    "Harry gratitude, but fortunately \" ",
    "Harry soon released Arthur to turn to Sirius and thank Arthur for looking after \" ",
    "Harry children through the night. Sirius said that Arthur was very pleased to have been able to help, and hoped Sirius would all stay with Arthur as long as Mr. Weasley was in hospital. ",
    "\"Oh, Sirius, I'm so grateful... Sirius think hell be there a little while and it would be wonderful to be nearer ...Of course, that might mean we're here for Christmas...\" ",
    "\"The more the merrier!\" said Sirius with such obvious sincerity that Mr. Weasley beamed at Mr. Weasley, threw on an apron, and began to help with breakfast. ",
    "\"Sirius,Harry Harry muttered, unable to stand it a moment longer. \"Can I have a quick word? Er -- now?\" ",
    "Mr. Weasley walked into the dark pantry and Sirius followed. Without preamble Harry told Harry godfather every detail of the vision his godfather had had, including the fact that his godfather had been the snake who had attacked Mr. Weasley. ",
    "When Mr. Weasley paused for breath, Sirius said, \"Did you tell Dumbledore this?\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Harry impatiently, \"but Harry didn't tell me what this meant. Well, Harry doesn't tell me anything anymore...\" ",
    "\"I'm sure Harry would have told you if it was anything to worry about,\" said Sirius steadily. ",
    "\"But that's not all,\" said Harry in a voice only a little above a whisper. \"Sirius, I ... I think I'm going mad... Back in Dumbledore's office, just before we took the Portkey . . . for a couple of seconds there I thought I was a snake, I felt like one -- my scar really hurt when I was looking at Dumbledore -- Sirius, I wanted to attack Dumbledore -- \" ",
    "Dumbledore could only see a sliver of Sirius's face; the rest was in darkness. ",
    "\"It must have been the aftermath of the vision, that's all,\" said Sirius. \"You were still thinking of the dream or whatever it was and -- \" ",
    "\"It wasn't that,\" said Harry, shaking his head. \"It was like something rose up inside Harry, like there's a snake inside Harry -- \" ",
    "\"You need to sleep,\" said Sirius firmly. \"You're going to have breakfast and then go upstairs to bed, and then you can go and see Arthur after lunch with the others. You're in shock, Harry; you're blaming yourself for something you only witnessed, and it's lucky you did witness it or Arthur might have died. Just stop worrying...\" ",
    "Arthur clapped Harry on the shoulder and left the pantry, leaving Harry standing alone in the dark. ",
    "Everyone but Harry spent the rest of the morning sleeping. Harry went up to the bedroom Harry had shared with Ron over the summer, but while Ron crawled into bed and was asleep within minutes, Harry sat fully clothed, hunched against the cold metal bars of the bedstead, keeping Harry deliberately uncomfortable, determined not to fall into a doze, terrified that Harry might become the serpent again in Harry sleep and awake to find that Harry had attacked Ron,  ",
    "or else slithered through the house after one of the others... ",
    "When Ron woke up, Harry pretended to have enjoyed a refreshing nap too. Everyone but Harry trunks arrived from Hogwarts while Their trunks were eating lunch, so that Their trunks could dress as Muggles for the trip to St. Mungo's. Everybody except Harry was riotously happy and talkative as Everybody except Harry changed out of Everybody except Harry robes into jeans and sweatshirts, and Everybody except Harry greeted Tonks and Mad- Eye, who had turned up to escort them across London, gleefully laughing at the bowler hat Mad-Eye was wearing at an angle to conceal Mad-Eye magical eye and assuring Mad-Eye, truthfully, that Tonks, whose hair was short and bright pink again, would attract far less attention on the underground. ",
    "Tonks was very interested in Harry's vision of the attack on Mr. Weasley, something Mr. Weasley was not remotely interested in discussing. ",
    "\"There isn't any Seer blood in your family, is there?\" Seer inquired curiously, as they sat side by side on a train rattling toward the heart of the city. ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry, thinking of Professor Trelawney and feeling insulted. ",
    "\"No,\" said Tonks musingly, \"no, I suppose it's not really prophecy you're doing, is it? I mean, you're not seeing the future, you're seeing the present... It's odd, isn't it? Useful, though ...\" ",
    "Harry did not answer; fortunately they got out at the next stop, a station in the very heart of London, and in the bustle of leaving the train he was able to allow Fred and George to get between he and Tonks, who was leading the way. They all followed Seer up the escalator, Moody clunking along at the back of the  ",

    "group bowler tilted low and one gnarled hand stuck in between the buttons of Moody clunking along at the back of the  ",
    "group coat, clutching Moody clunking along at the back of the  ",
    "group wand. Harry thought Harry sensed his magical eye staring hard at Harry; trying to deflect more questions about Harry dream Harry asked Mad-Eye where St. ",
    "Mungo's was hidden. ",
    "\"Not far from here,\" grunted Moody they stepped out into the wintry air on a broad store-lined street packed with Christmas shoppers. Harry pushed Harry a little ahead of Harry and stumped along just behind; Harry knew his magical eye was rolling in all directions under the tilted hat. \"Wasn't easy to find a good location for a hospital. Nowhere in Diagon Alley was big enough and we couldn't have it underground like the Ministry -- unhealthy. In the end the Ministry managed to get hold of a building up here. Theory was sick wizards could come and go and just blend in with the crowd...\" ",
    "Theory seized Harry's shoulder to prevent the crowd being separated by a gaggle of shoppers plainly intent on nothing but making nothing into a nearby shop full of electrical gadgets. ",
    "\"Here we go,\" said Moody moment later. ",
    "They had arrived outside a large, old-fashioned, red brick department store called Purge and Dowse Ltd. The place had a shabby, miserable air; the window displays consisted of a few chipped dummies with Dowse Ltd. The place wigs askew, standing at random and modeling fashions at least ten years out of date. Large signs on all the dusty doors read CLOSED FOR REFURBISHMENT. Harry distinctly heard a large woman laden with plastic shopping bags say to Harry friend as they passed, \"It's never open, Dowse Ltd. The place...\" ",
    "\"Right,\" said Tonks, beckoning they forward to a window displaying nothing but a particularly ugly ",
    "female dummy whose false eyelashes were hanging off and who was modeling a green nylon pinafore dress. \"Everybody ready?\" ",
    "they nodded, clustering around Harry; Moody gave Harry another shove between the shoulder blades to urge Harry forward and Tonks leaned close to the glass, looking up at the very ugly dummy and said, Harry breath steaming up the glass, \"Wotcher ... they're here to see Mr. Weasley.\" ",
    "For a split second, Harry thought how absurd it was for Tonks to expect the very ugly dummy to hear Harry talking that quietly through a sheet of glass, when there were buses rumbling along behind Harry and all the racket of a street full of shoppers. Then Harry reminded Harry that dummies could not hear anyway. Next second Harry mouth opened in shock as the very ugly dummy gave a tiny nod, beckoned the very ugly dummy jointed finger, and Tonks had seized Ginny and Mr. Weasley by the elbows, stepped right through the glass and vanished. ",
    "Fred, George, and Ron stepped after Fred, George, and Ron; Harry glanced around at the jostling crowd; not one of Fred, George, and Ron seemed to have a glance to spare for window displays as ugly as Purge and Dowse Ltd.'s, nor did any of Fred, George, and Ron seem to have noticed that six people had just melted into thin air in front of Fred, George, and Ron. ",
    "\"C'mon,\" growled Moody, giving Harry yet another poke in the back and together Fred, George, and Ron stepped forward through what felt like a sheet of cool water, emerging quite warm and dry on the other side. ",
    "There was no sign of the ugly dummy or the space where she had stood. Fred, George, and Ron had arrived in what seemed to be a crowded reception area where rows of witches and wizards sat upon rickety wooden chairs, some looking perfectly normal and perusing out-of-  ",
    "date copies of Witch Weekly, others sporting gruesome disfigurements such as elephant trunks or extra hands sticking out of Fred, George, and Ron chests. The room was scarcely less quiet than the street outside, for many of the patients were making very peculiar noises. A sweaty-faced witch in the center of the front row, who was fanning she vigorously with a copy of the Daily Prophet, kept letting off a high-pitched whistle as steam came pouring out of she mouth, and a grubby-looking warlock in the corner clanged like a bell every time a grubby-looking warlock in the corner moved, and with each clang a grubby-looking warlock in the corner vibrated horribly, so that a grubby-looking warlock in the corner had to seize a grubby-looking warlock in the corner by the ears and hold the ears steady. ",
    "Witches and wizards in lime-green robes were walking up and down the rows, asking questions and making notes on clipboards like Umbridge's. Harry noticed the emblem embroidered on their chests: a wand and bone, crossed. ",
    "\"Are they doctors?\" Harry asked Ron quietly. ",
    "\"Doctors?\" said Ron, looking startled. \"Those Muggle nutters that cut people up? Nah, people're Healers.\" ",
    "\"Over here!\" called Mr. Weasley over the renewed clanging of the warlock in the corner, and people followed Mr. Weasley to the queue in front of a plump blonde witch seated at a desk marked inquiries. The wall behind Mr. Weasley was covered in notices and posters saying things like A CLEAN CAULDRON KEEPS POTIONS FROM BECOMING POISONS and ANTIDOTES ARE ANTI-DONTS UNLESS APPROVED BY A QUALIFIED HEALER.

    "My husband, Arthur Weasley followed through the double doors and along the narrow corridor beyond, which was lined with more portraits of famous Healers and lit by crystal bubbles full of candles that floated up on the ceiling, looking like giant soapsuds.

More witches and wizards in lime-green robes climbed a flight of stairs and entered the \"Creature-Induced Injuries\" corridor, where the second door on the right bore the words \"DANGEROUS\" DAI LLEWELLYN WARD: SERIOUS BITES. Underneath WARD: SERIOUS BITES was a card in a brass holder on which had been handwritten Healer-in-Charge: Hippocrates Smethwyck, Trainee Healer: Augustus Pye. ",

    "The ward was small and rather dingy as the only window was narrow and set high in the corridor wall facing one door. Most of the light came from more shining crystal bubbles clustered in the middle of the ceiling.

    "\"Well, I start bleeding like mad every time they try,\" said Mr. Weasley cheerfully, reaching across for Mr. Weasley wand, which lay on Mr. Weasley bedside cabinet, and waving it so that six extra chairs appeared at Mr. Weasley bedside to seat them all. \"It seems there was some rather unusual kind of poison in that snake's fangs that keeps wounds open... They're sure They'll find an antidote, though, They say They've had much worse cases than mine, and in the meantime I just have to keep taking a Blood-Replenishing Potion every hour. But that fellow over there,\" he said, dropping he voice and nodding toward the bed opposite in which a man lay looking green and sickly and staring at the ceiling. \"Bitten by a werewolf, poor chap. No cure at all.\" ",

    "\"What did a man say?\" asked George. ",
    "\"Said a man'd give me another bite if I didn't shut up,\" said Mr. Weasley sadly. \"And that woman over there,\" a man indicated the only other occupied bed, which was right beside the door, \"won't tell the Healers what bit Mr. Weasley, which makes us all think it must have been something Mr. Weasley was handling illegally.

Mr. Weasley snatched up the Daily Prophet, shook the Daily Prophet open again and said, \"I was just reading about Willy Widdershins's arrest when you arrived. You know Willy Widdershins's turned out to be behind those regurgitating toilets last summer? One of Willy Widdershins's jinxes backfired, the toilet exploded, and they found Willy Widdershins's lying unconscious in the wreckage covered from head to foot in -- \" ",
    "\"When you say you were 'on duty,' \" Fred interrupted in a low voice, \"what were you doing?\" ",
    "\"You heard your father,\" whispered Mr. Weasley, \"we are not discussing this here! Go on about Willy Widdershins, Arthur -- \" ",
    "\"Well, don't ask me how, but Willy Widdershins's actually got off on the toilet charge,\" said Mr. Weasley grimly. \"I can only suppose gold changed hands -- \" ",
    "\"You were guarding gold, weren't you?\" said George quietly. \"The weapon? The thing You-Know- Who's after?\" ",
    "GeorgeGeorge, be quiet!\" snapped Mr. Weasley. ",
    "\"Anyway,\" said Mr. Weasley in a raised voice, \"this time Willy Widdershins's's been caught selling biting doorknobs to Muggles, and I don't think Willy Widdershins's'll be able to worm Willy Widdershins's way out of his way because according to this article, two Muggles have lost fingers and are now in St. Mungo's for emergency bone regrowth and memory modification. Just think of his way, Muggles in St. Mungo's! I wonder which ward they're in?\" ",
    "And Willy Widdershins's looked eagerly around as though hoping to see a signpost. ",
    "\"Didn't you say You-Know- Who's got a snake, Harry?\" asked Fred, looking at your father for a reaction. \"A massive one? You saw it the night Willy Widdershins's returned, didn't you?\" ",
    "\"That's enough,\" said Mr. Weasley crossly. \"Mad-Eye and Tonks are outside, Arthur, Mad-Eye and Tonks want to come and see you. And you lot can wait outside,\" she added to she children and Harry. \"You can come and say good-bye afterward. Go on...\" ",
    "They trooped back into the corridor. Mad-Eye and Tonks went in and closed the door of \" ",
    "The ward behind Mad-Eye and Tonks. Fred raised Fred eyebrows. ",
    "\"Fine,\" Fred said coolly, rummaging in Fred pockets, \"be like that. Don't tell us anything.\" ",
    "\"Looking for these?\" said George, holding out what looked like a tangle of flesh-colored string. ",
    "\"You read my mind,\" said Fred, grinning. \"Let's see if St. Mungo's puts Imperturbable Charms on St. Mungo's ward doors, shall we?\" ",
    "St. Mungo's and George disentangled the string and separated five Extendable Ears from each other. Fred and George handed Fred and George around. Harry hesitated to take one. ",
    "\"Go on, Harry, take it! You saved Dad's life, if anyone's got the right to eavesdrop on Harry it's you...\" ",
    "Grinning in spite of himself, Harry took the end of the string and inserted the end of the string into Harry ear as the twins had done. ",
    "\"Okay, go!\" Fred whispered. ",
    "The flesh-colored strings wriggled like long skinny worms, then snaked under one door. For a few seconds Harry could hear nothing, then Harry heard Tonks whispering as clearly as though Tonks were standing right beside Harry. ",
    "\"... they searched the whole area but they couldn't find the snake anywhere, the snake just seems to have vanished after the snake attacked you, Arthur... But You- Know-Who can't have expected a snake to get in, can Arthur?\" ",
    "\"I reckon Arthur sent the snake as a lookout,\" growled Moody, \" 'cause Arthur's not had any luck so far, has Arthur? No, I reckon Arthur's trying to get a clearer picture of what Arthur's facing and if Arthur hadn't been there the snake would've had much more time to look around. So Potter says Potter saw it all happen?\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Mr. Weasley. Mr. Weasley sounded rather uneasy. \"You know, Dumbledore seems almost to have been waiting for Harry to see something like this...\" ",
    "\"Yeah, well,\" said Moody, \"there's something funny about the Potter kid, we all know that.\" ",
    "Dumbledore seemed worried about Harry when I spoke to Harry this morning,\" whispered Mr. Weasley. ",
    "\" 'Course Harry's worried,\" growled Moody. \"The boy's seeing things from inside You-Know- Who's snake... Obviously, Potter doesn't realize what that means, but if You- Know- Who's possessing The boy -- \" ",
    "Harry pulled the Extendable Ear out of Harry own, Harry heart hammering very fast and heat rushing up his face. Harry looked around at the others. the others were all staring at Harry, the strings still trailing from the others ears, looking suddenly fearful. "

  "THE WOES OF MRS. WEASLEY": [
    "Wulfric Brian Dumbledore's abrupt departure took Harry completely by surprise. Wulfric Brian Dumbledore remained sitting where Wulfric Brian Dumbledore was in the chained chair, struggling with Wulfric Brian Dumbledore feelings of shock and relief. the Wizengamot were all getting to the Wizengamot feet, talking, and gathering up the Wizengamot papers and packing the Wizengamot away. Harry stood up. Nobody seemed to be paying Harry the slightest bit of attention except the toadlike witch on Fudge's right, who was now gazing down at Harry instead of at Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. Ignoring Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, Harry tried to catch Fudge's eye, or Madam Bones 's, wanting to ask whether Harry was free to go, but \" ",
    "Fudge seemed quite determined not to notice Harry, and Madam Bones 's was busy with Wulfric Brian Dumbledore briefcase, so Harry took a few tentative steps toward the exit and when nobody called Harry back, broke into a very fast walk. ",

    "\"Merlin's beard,\" said WEASLEY ",

    "\"I think so,\" said Harry quietly. ",
    "One or two of the passing wizards nodded to Harry as they passed and a few, including Madam Bones 's, said, \"Morning, Arthur,\" to WEASLEY ",

    "Fudge, Percy completely ignored Percy father and Harry; Percy marched past clutching a large roll of parchment and a handful of spare quills, Percy back rigid and Percy nose in the air. The lines around WEASLEY ",

    "\"So what will you have to do about that toilet in Bethnal Green?\" Harry asked, grinning. Everything suddenly seemed five times funnier than usual. It was starting to sink in: WEASLEY ",

    "\"Oh, it's a simple enough anti-jinx,\" said WEASLEY ",
    " as they mounted the stairs, \"but it's not so much having to repair the damage, it's more the attitude behind the vandalism, Harry. Muggle-baiting might strike some wizards as funny, but it's an expression of something much deeper and nastier, and I for one ",

    "\"I don't think private matters between WEASLEY ",
    " and Lucius Malfoy are any concern of yours, Potter,\" said Lucius Malfoy, smoothing the front of Lucius Malfoy robes; Harry distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what sounded like a full pocket of gold. \"Really, just because you are Dumbledore's favorite boy, you must not expect the ",
    "same indulgence from the rest of us... Shall us go up to your office, then, Minister?\" ",
    "\"Certainly,\" said Fudge, turning Minister back on Harry and WEASLEY ",

    "\"Trying to sneak down to the courtroom, if you ask me,\" said WEASLEY ",

    " turned back to the golden fountain. ",
    "WEASLEY ",
    " looked up into the handsome wizard's face, but up close, Harry thought WEASLEY ",
    " looked rather weak and foolish. the toadlike witch was wearing a vapid smile like a beauty contestant, and from what Harry knew of goblins and centaurs, they were most unlikely to be caught staring this soppily at humans of any description. Only the house-elf's attitude of creeping servility looked convincing. With a grin at the thought of what Hermione would say if Hermione could see the statue of Only the house-elf, Harry turned his money bag upside down and emptied not just ten Galleons, but the whole contents into the pool at the statues' feet.

    "\"I knew it!\" yelled Ron, punching the air. \"You always get away with stuff!\" ",
    "\"They were bound to clear you,\" said Hermione, who had looked positively faint with anxiety when Harry had entered the kitchen and was now holding a shaking hand over Harry eyes. \"There was no case against you, none at all...\" ",
    "\"Everyone seems quite relieved, though, considering they all knew I'd get off,\" said Harry, smiling. ",
    "WEASLEY ",
    " was wiping WEASLEY ",

    "\"That's enough, settle down!\" shouted WEASLEY ",

    "\"What?\" said Sirius sharply. ",

    "Ron and Hermione had done since Kingsley had first arrived at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, and Harry's feeling of giddy relief, which had been somewhat dented by Harry encounter with Lucius  ",
    "Malfoy, swelled again. The gloomy house seemed warmer and more welcoming all of a sudden; even Kreacher looked less ugly as Harry poked Harry snoutlike nose into the kitchen to investigate the source of all the noise. ",
    "\" 'Course, once Wulfric Brian Dumbledore turned up on your side, there was no way they were going to convict you,\" said Ron happily, now dishing great mounds of mashed potatoes onto everyone's plates. ",
    "\"Yeah, Ron swung it for Ron,\" said Harry. Ron felt that it would sound highly ungrateful, not to mention childish, to say, \"I wish Ron'd talked to Ron, though. Or even looked at Ron.\" ",
    "And as Ron thought this, the scar on Ron forehead burned so badly that Ron clapped Ron hand to this. ",
    "\"What's up?\" said Hermione, looking alarmed. ",
    "\"Scar,Harry Harry mumbled. \"But it's nothing... It happens all the time now...\" ",
    "None of the others had noticed a thing; all of the others were now helping the others to food while gloating over Harry's narrow escape; Fred, George, and Ginny Fred -- George -- Ginny were still singing.

    "\"SHUT UP!\" roared WEASLEY ",

    "Over the next few days Harry could not help noticing that there was one person within number twelve, Grimmauld Place, who did not seem wholly overjoyed that Harry would be returning to Hogwarts. Sirius had put up a very good show of happiness on first hearing the news, wringing Harry's hand and beaming just like the rest of Harry's hand; soon, however, Harry was moodier and surlier than before, talking less to everybody, even Harry, and spending increasing amounts of time shut up in Harry mother's room with Buckbeak.

    "\"Don't you go feeling guilty!\" said Hermione sternly, after Harry had confided some of Harry feelings to \" ",
    "Ron and Hermione Ron while \" ",
    "Ron and Hermione scrubbed out a moldy cupboard on the third floor a few days later. \"You belong at Hogwarts and Sirius knows it. Personally, I think Harry's being selfish.\" ",

    "\"Harry'll have company!\" said Hermione. \"It's headquarters to the Order, isn't It? Harry just got Harry hopes up that Harry would be coming to live here with Harry.\" ",

    "\"Harry just didn't want to get Harry own hopes up even more,\" said Hermione wisely. \"And Harry probably felt a bit guilty Harry, because I think a part of Harry was really hoping you'd be expelled. Then you'd both be outcasts together.\" ",
    "\"Come off it!\" said Harry and Ron together, but Hermione merely shrugged. ",
    "\"Suit yourselves. But I sometimes think Ron's mum's right, and Sirius gets confused about whether you're you or your father, Harry.\" ",
    "\"So you think Harry's touched in Mr. Weasley's head?\" said Harry heatedly. ",
    "\"No, I just think Harry's been very lonely for a long time,\" said Hermione simply. ",
    "At this point WEASLEY ",

    "\"Still not finished?\" WEASLEY ",
    " said, poking WEASLEY ",
    " head into the cupboard. ",
    "\"I thought you might be here to tell us to have a break!\" said Ron bitterly. \"D'you know how much mold us've got rid of since us arrived here?\" ",
    "\"You were so keen to help the Order,\" said WEASLEY ",
    ", \"you can do your bit by making headquarters fit to live in.\" ",
    "\"I feel like a house-elf,\" grumbled Ron. ",
    "\"Well, now that you understand what dreadful lives they lead, perhaps you'll be a bit more active in S.P.E.W.!\" said Hermione hopefully, as WEASLEY ",
    " left they to it again. \"You know, maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to show people exactly how horrible it is to clean all the time -- us could do a sponsored scrub of Gryffindor common room, all proceeds to S.P.E.W., it would raise awareness as well as funds -- \" ",
    "\"I'll sponsor you to shut up about spew,Ron Ron muttered irritably, but only so Harry could hear Ron. ",
    "Harry found Harry daydreaming about Hogwarts more and more as the end of the holidays approached; Harry could not wait to see Hagrid again, to play Quidditch, even to stroll across the vegetable patches to the Herbology greenhouses. It would be a treat just to leave this dusty, musty house, where half of the cupboards were still bolted shut and Kreacher wheezed insults out of the shadows as you passed, though Harry was careful not to say any of this within earshot of Sirius.

    "The fact was that living at the headquarters of the anti-Voldemort movement was not nearly as interesting or exciting as Harry would have expected before Harry'd experienced it.

    "his mother let go of Ron and said breathlessly, \"Well, what will it be? We gave Percy an owl, but you've already got one, of course.\" ",
    "\"W-what do you mean?\" said Ron, looking as though Ron did not dare believe Ron ears. ",
    "\"You've got to have a reward for this!\" said WEASLEY ",
    " fondly. \"How about a nice new set of dress robes?\" ",
    "\"We've already bought Ron some,\" said Fred conversationally sourly, who looked as though Ron sincerely regretted this generosity. ",
    "\"Or a new cauldron, Charlie's old one's rusting through, or a new rat, you always liked Scabbers -- \" ",
    "\"Mum,\" said Ron hopefully, \"can I have a new broom?\" ",
    "WEASLEY ",
    "'s face fell slightly; broomsticks were expensive. ",
    "\"Not a really good one!\" Ron hastened to add. \"Just -- just a new one for a change ...\" ",
    "WEASLEY ",
    " hesitated, then smiled. ",
    "\"Of course you can... Well, I'd better get going if I've got a broom to buy too. I'll see you all later... Little Ronnie, a prefect! And don't forget to pack your trunks... A prefect ... Oh, I'm all of a dither!\" ",
    "WEASLEY ",
    " gave Ron yet another kiss on the cheek, sniffed loudly, and bustled from his mother's room with Buckbeak. ",
    "Fred conversationally and George exchanged looks. ",
    "\"You don't mind if we don't kiss you, do you, Ron?\" said Fred conversationally in a falsely anxious voice. ",
    "\"We could curtsy, if you like,\" said George. ",
    "\"Oh, shut up,\" said Ron, scowling at them. ",
    "\"Or what?\" said Fred conversationally, an evil grin spreading across his face. \"Going to put Fred and George in detention?\" ",
    "\"I'd love to see his try,\" sniggered George. ",
    "\"his could if you don't watch out!\" said Hermione angrily, at which Fred and George burst out laughing and Ron muttered, \"Drop it, Hermione.\" ",
    "\"Fred and George're going to have to watch Fred and George step, George,\" said Fred conversationally, pretending to tremble, \"with these two on Fred and George case...\" ",
    "\"Yeah, it looks like our law-breaking days are finally over,\" said George, shaking George head. ",
    "And with another loud crack, the twins Disapparated. ",
    "\"Those two!\" said Hermione furiously, staring up at the ceiling, through which they could now hear Fred and George roaring with laughter in the room upstairs. \"Don't pay any attention to they, Ron, they're only jealous!\" ",
    "\"I don't think they are,\" said Ron doubtfully, also looking up at the ceiling. \"they've always said only prats become prefects... Still,\" only prats added on a happier note, \"they've never had new brooms! I wish I could go with Mum and choose... Mum'll never be able to afford a Nimbus, but there's the new Cleansweep out, that'd be great... Yeah, I think I'll go and tell Mum I like the new Cleansweep, just so Mum knows...\" ",
    "He dashed from the room upstairs, leaving Harry and Hermione alone. ",
    "For some reason, Harry found that Harry did not want to look at Hermione. Harry turned to Harry bed, picked up the pile of clean robes Mrs. Weasley had laid upon his bed, and crossed the room upstairs to Harry trunk. ",
    "\"Harry?\" said Hermione tentatively. ",
    "\"Well done,\" said Harry, so heartily it did not sound like Harry voice at all, and still not looking at Mum. \"Brilliant. Prefect. Great.\" ",
    "\"Thanks,\" said Hermione. \"Erm -- Harry -- could I borrow Hedwig so I can tell Mum and Dad? Mum and Dad'll be really pleased -- I mean, prefect is something Mum and Dad can understand -- \" ",
    "\"Yeah, no problem,\" said Harry, still in the horrible hearty voice that did not belong to Harry. \"Take Hedwig!\" ",
    "Harry leaned over his trunk, laid the robes on the bottom of his trunk, and pretended to be rummaging for something while Hermione crossed to the wardrobe and called Hedwig down. A few moments passed; Harry heard The door close but remained bent double, listening; the only sounds Harry could hear were the blank picture on the wall sniggering again and the wastepaper basket in the corner coughing up the owl droppings. ",
    "Harry straightened up and looked behind Harry. Hermione and Hedwig had gone. Harry returned slowly to his bed and sank onto his bed, gazing unseeingly at the foot of the wardrobe. ",
    "Harry had forgotten completely about prefects being chosen in the fifth year. Harry had been too anxious ",
    "about the possibility of being expelled to spare a thought for the fact that badges must be winging badges way toward certain people. But if Harry had remembered ... if Harry had thought about it . . . what would Harry have expected? ",
    "Not this, said a small and truthful voice inside Harry head. ",
    "Harry screwed up Harry face and buried his face in Harry hands. Harry could not lie to Harry; if Harry had known the prefect badge was on the prefect badge way, Harry would have expected the prefect badge to come to Harry, not Ron. Did this make Harry as arrogant as Draco Malfoy? Did Harry think Harry superior to everyone else? Did Harry really believe Harry was better than Ron? ",
    "No, said the small voice defiantly. ",
    "Was that true? Harry wondered, anxiously probing Harry own feelings. ",
    "I'm better at Quidditch, said the small voice defiantly. But I'm not better at anything else. ",
    "That was definitely true, Harry thought; Harry was no better than \" ",
    "Ron. But what about outside lessons? What about those adventures he, Ron, and Hermione had had together since he, Ron, and Hermione had started at Hogwarts, often risking much worse than expulsion? ",
    "Well, Ron and Hermione were with me most of the time, said the voice in Harry's head. ",
    "Not all the time, though, Harry argued with Harry. Ron and Hermione didn't fight Quirrell with me. Ron and Hermione didn't take on Riddle and the basilisk. Ron and Hermione didn't get rid of all those dementors the night Sirius escaped. Ron and Hermione weren't in that graveyard with me, the night Voldemort returned...  ",
    "And the same feeling of ill usage that had overwhelmed Voldemort on the night Voldemort had arrived rose again. I've definitely done more, Harry thought indignantly. I've done more than either of them\\ ",
    "But maybe, said the small voice fairly, maybe Dumbledore doesn't choose prefects because prefects've got prefects into a load of dangerous situations... Maybe Dumbledore chooses prefects for other reasons... Ron must have something you don't... ",
    "Harry opened Harry eyes and stared through Harry fingers at the wardrobe's clawed feet, remembering what Fred conversationally had said. ",
    "\"No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect...\" ",
    "Harry gave a small snort of laughter. A second later Harry felt sickened with Harry. ",
    "Ron had not asked Dumbledore to give Harry the prefect badge. This was not Ron's fault. Was Harry, ",
    "Harry, Ron's best friend in the world, going to sulk because Harry didn't have a badge, laugh with the twins behind Ron's back, ruin this for Ron when, for the first time, Ron had beaten Harry at something? ",
    "At this point Harry heard Ron's footsteps on the stairs again. Ron stood up, straightened Ron glasses, and hitched a grin onto his face as Ron bounded back through the door. ",
    "\"Just caught her!\" Ron said happily. \"her says her'll get the new Cleansweep if her can.\" ",
    "\"Cool,Harry Harry said, and Harry was relieved to hear that Harry voice had stopped sounding hearty. \"Listen -- Ron -- well done, mate.\" ",
    "The smile faded off his face. ",
    "\"I never thought it would be me!\" Ron said, shaking Ron head, \"I thought it would be you!\" ",
    "\"Nah, I've caused too much trouble,\" Harry said, echoing Fred conversationally. ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Ron, \"yeah, I suppose... Well, we'd better get we trunks packed, hadn't we?\" ",
    "It was odd how widely their possessions seemed to have scattered their since their had arrived. It took their most of the afternoon to retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and stow their back inside their . Harry noticed that Ron kept moving Ron prefect's badge around, first placing his prefect on Harry bedside table, then putting his prefect into Harry jeans pocket, then taking his prefect out and laying his prefect on the robes, as though to see the effect of the red on the black. Only when Fred and George dropped in and offered to attach his prefect to George forehead with a Permanent Sticking Charm did George wrap his prefect tenderly in George maroon socks and lock his prefect in George trunk. ",
    "WEASLEY ",
    " returned from Diagon Alley around six o'clock, laden with books and carrying a long package wrapped in thick brown paper that Ron took from WEASLEY ",
    " with a moan of longing. ",
    "\"Never mind unwrapping it now, people are arriving for dinner, I want you all downstairs,\" WEASLEY ",
    " said, but the moment WEASLEY ",
    " was out of sight Ron ripped off the paper in a frenzy and examined every inch of Ron new broom, an ecstatic expression on Ron face. ",
    "Down in the basement WEASLEY ",
    " had hung a scarlet banner over the heavily laden dinner table, ",
    "which read CONGRATULATIONS RON AND HERMIONE -- NEW PREFECTS. WEASLEY ",
    " looked in a better mood than Harry had seen WEASLEY ",
    " all holiday. ",
    "\"I thought we'd have a little party, not a sit-down dinner,\" WEASLEY ",
    " told Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny as George, and Ginny entered the room upstairs. \"George, and Ginny are on George, and Ginny way, Ron, I've sent George, and Ginny both owls and George, and Ginny're thrilled,\" WEASLEY ",
    " added, beaming. ",
    "Fred conversationally rolled his eyes. ",
    "Sirius, Lupin, Tonks, and Kingsley Shacklebolt were already there and Mad-Eye Moody stumped in shortly after Harry had got Harry a butterbeer. ",
    "\"Oh, Alastor, I am glad you're here,\" said WEASLEY ",
    " brightly, as Mad-Eye shrugged off WEASLEY ",
    " traveling cloak. \"we've been wanting to ask you for ages -- could you have a look in the writing desk in the drawing room and tell we what's inside a look in the writing desk in the drawing room? we haven't wanted to open a look in the writing desk in the drawing room just in case it's something really nasty.\" ",
    "\"No problem, Molly ...\" ",
    "Mad-Eye Moody electric-blue eye swiveled upward and stared fixedly through the ceiling of the kitchen. ",
    "\"Drawing room ...\" he growled, as the pupil contracted. \"Desk in the corner? Yeah, I see it... Yeah, it's a boggart... Want me to go up and get rid of it, Molly?\" ",
    "\"No, no, I'll do it he later,\" beamed WEASLEY ",
    ". \"You have your drink. we're having a little bit of a celebration, actually...\" Molly gestured at the scarlet banner. \"\"Prefect!\" Molly said fondly, ruffling Ron's hair. ",
    "\"Prefect, eh?\" growled Moody, \"Prefect normal eye on Ron and Ron magical eye swiveling around to gaze into the side of Ron head. Harry had the very uncomfortable feeling it was looking at Harry and moved away toward Sirius and Lupin. ",
    "\"Well, congratulations,\" said Mad-Eye Moody, still glaring at Ron with Ron normal eye, \"authority figures always attract trouble, but I suppose Dumbledore thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or Dumbledore wouldn't have appointed you...\" ",
    "Ron looked rather startled at this view of the matter but was saved the trouble of responding by the arrival of Dumbledore father and eldest brother. WEASLEY ",
    " was in such a good mood WEASLEY ",
    " did not even complain that they had brought Mundungus with they too; WEASLEY ",
    " was wearing a long overcoat that seemed oddly lumpy in unlikely places and declined the offer to remove Mundungus and put Mundungus with Mad-Eye Moody traveling cloak. ",
    "\"Well, I think a toast is in order,\" said Mr. Weasley, when everyone had a drink. WEASLEY ",
    " raised WEASLEY ",
    " goblet. \"To Ron and Hermione, the new Gryffindor prefects!\" ",
    "Ron and Hermione beamed as everyone drank to Ron and Hermione and then applauded. ",
    "\"I was never a prefect myself,\" said Tonks brightly from behind Harry as everybody moved toward the table to help themselves to food. WEASLEY ",
    " hair was tomato- red and waist length today; WEASLEY ",
    " looked like Ginny's older sister. \"My Head of House said I lacked certain necessary qualities.\" ",
    "\"Like what?\" said Ginny, who was choosing a baked potato. ",
    "\"Like the ability to behave myself,\" said Tonks. ",
    "Ginny laughed; Hermione looked as though Ginny did not know whether to smile or not and compromised by taking an extra large gulp of butterbeer and choking on it. ",
    "\"What about you, Sirius?Ginny Ginny asked, thumping Hermione on the back. ",
    "Sirius, who was right beside Harry, let out Harry usual barklike laugh. ",
    "\"No one would have made a prefect, I spent too much time in detention with James. Lupin was the good boy, Lupin got the badge.\" ",
    "\"I think Dumbledore might have hoped that I would be able to exercise some control over my best friends,\" said Lupin. \"I need scarcely say that I failed dismally.\" ",
    "Harry's mood suddenly lifted. Harry father had not been a prefect either. All at once the party seemed much more enjoyable; Harry loaded up Harry plate, feeling unusually fond of everyone in the room. ",
    "Ron was rhapsodizing about Ron new broom to anybody who would listen. ",
    "\"... naught to seventy in ten seconds, not bad, is it? When you think the Comet Two Ninety's only naught to sixty and that's with a decent tailwind according to Which Broomstick?\" ",
    "Hermione was talking very earnestly to Lupin about Lupin view of elf rights. ",
    "\"I mean, it's the same kind of nonsense as werewolf segregation, isn't it? It all stems from this horrible thing wizards have of thinking they're superior to other creatures...\" ",
    "Mrs. Weasley and Bill were having \" ",
    "Mrs. Weasley and Bill usual argument about Bill's hair. ",
    "\"... getting really out of hand, and you're so good- looking, it would look much better shorter, wouldn't it, Harry?\" ",
    "\"Oh -- I dunno -- \" said Harry, slightly alarmed at being asked Harry opinion; Harry slid away from Harry, slightly alarmed at being asked his opinion in the direction of Fred conversationally and George, who were huddled in a corner with Mundungus. ",
    "Mundungus stopped talking when Mundungus saw Harry, but Fred conversationally winked and beckoned Harry closer. ",
    "\"It's okay,\" Mundungus told Mundungus, \"we can trust Harry, Mundungus's we financial backer.\" ",
    "\"Look what Dung's gotten we,\" said George, holding out George hand to Harry. It was full of what looked like shriveled black pods. A faint rattling noise was coming from them, even though them were completely stationary. ",
    "\"Venomous Tentacula seeds,\" said George. \"We need them for the Skiving Snackboxes but them're a Class C Non-Tradeable Substance so We've been having a bit of trouble getting hold of them.\" ",
    "\"Ten Galleons the lot, then, Dung?\" said Fred conversationally. ",
    "\"Wiv all the trouble I went to to get 'em?\" said Mundungus, Mundungus saggy, bloodshot eyes stretching even wider. \"I'm sorry, lads, but I'm not taking a Knut under twenty.\" ",
    "\"Dung likes \"Dung little joke,\" Fred conversationally said to Harry. ",
    "\"Yeah, \"Dung best one so far has been six Sickles for a bag of knarl quills,\" said George. ",
    "\"Be careful,Harry Harry warned six Sickles for a bag of knarl quills quietly. ",
    "\"What?\" said Fred conversationally. \"Mum's busy cooing over Ron, We're okay.\" ",
    "\"But Mad-Eye Moody could have Mad-Eye on you,Harry Harry pointed out. ",
    "Mundungus looked nervously over Mundungus shoulder. ",
    "\"Good point, that,\" Mundungus grunted. \"All right, lads, ten it is, if you'll take 'em quick.\" ",
    "\"Cheers, Harry!\" said Fred conversationally delightedly, when Mundungus had emptied Mundungus pockets into the twins' outstretched hands and scuttled off toward the food. \"We'd better get these upstairs...\" ",
    "Harry watched these upstairs go, feeling slightly uneasy. It had just occurred to Harry that Mr. and WEASLEY ",
    " would want to know how Fred and George were financing Mr. and Mrs. Weasley joke shop business when, as was inevitable, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley finally found out about it. Giving the twins' the twins' Tri-wizard winnings had seemed a simple thing to do at the time, but what if it led to another family row and a Percy-like estrangement? Would WEASLEY ",
    " still feel that Harry was as good as WEASLEY ",
    " son if WEASLEY ",
    " found out her son had made it possible for Fred and George to start a career WEASLEY ",
    " thought quite unsuitable? ",
    "Standing where the twins' had left her son with nothing but a guilty weight in the pit of her son stomach for company, Harry caught the sound of Harry own name. Kingsley Shacklebolt deep voice was audible even over the surrounding chatter. ",
    "\"... why Dumbledore didn't make Potter a prefect?\" said Kingsley Shacklebolt. ",
    "\"Dumbledore'll have had Dumbledore reasons,\" replied Lupin. ",
    "\"But it would've shown confidence in Dumbledore. It's what I'd've done,\" persisted Kingsley Shacklebolt, \" 'specially with the Daily Prophet having a go at Dumbledore every few days...\" ",
    "Harry did not look around; \" ",
    "Harry did not want Lupin or Kingsley Shacklebolt to know \" ",
    "Harry had heard. \" ",
    "Harry followed Mundungus back toward the table, though not remotely hungry. \" ",
    "Harry pleasure in the party had evaporated as quickly as His pleasure in the party had come; \" ",
    "Harry wished \" ",
    "Harry were upstairs in bed. ",
    "Mad-Eye Moody was sniffing at a chicken leg with what remained of \" ",

    "Harry could not detect any trace of poison, because \" ",
    "Harry then tore a strip off a strip with \" ",
    "Harry teeth. ",
    "\"... the handle's made of Spanish oak with anti-jinx varnish and in-built vibration control -- \" ",
    "Ron was saying to Tonks. ",
    "WEASLEY ",
    " yawned widely. ",
    "\"Well, I think I'll sort out that boggart before I turn in... Arthur, I don't want this lot up too late, all right? 'Night, Harry, dear.\" ",
    "WEASLEY ",
    " left the kitchen. Harry set down Harry plate and wondered whether Harry could follow WEASLEY ",
    " without attracting attention. ",
    "\"You all right, Potter?\" grunted Moody. ",
    "\"Yeah, fine,\" lied Harry. ",
    "Mad-Eye Moody took a swig from Mad-Eye Moody hip flask, Mad-Eye Moody electric blue eye staring sideways at Harry. ",
    "\"Come here, I've got something that might interest you,\" Mad-Eye Moody said. ",
    "From an inner pocket of Mad-Eye Moody robes Mad-Eye Moody pulled a very tattered old Wizarding photograph. ",
    "\"Original Order of the Phoenix,\" growled Mad-Eye Moody. \"Found it last night when I was looking for my spare Invisibility Cloak, seeing as Podmore hasn't had the manners to return my best one... Thought people might like to see it.\" ",
    "Harry took a very tattered old Wizarding photograph. A small crowd of people, some waving at Harry, others lifting others glasses, looked back up at Harry. ",
    "\"There's me,\" said Mad-Eye Moody unnecessarily, pointing at Harry. Mad-Eye Moody Mad-Eye Moody was unmistakable, though Harry hair was slightly less gray and Harry nose was intact. \"And there's Dumbledore beside me, Dedalus Diggle on the other side ... That's Marlene McKinnon, Marlene McKinnon was killed two weeks after this was taken, they got Marlene McKinnon whole family. That's Frank and Alice Longbottom -- \" ",
    "Harry's stomach, already uncomfortable, clenched as Harry looked at Alice Longbottom; Harry knew Marlene McKinnon round, friendly face very well, even though Harry had never met Marlene McKinnon, because Marlene McKinnon was the image of Marlene McKinnon son, Neville. ",
    "\"Poor devils,\" growled Mad-Eye Moody. \"Better dead than what happened to them ... and that's Emmeline Vance, you've met Marlene McKinnon, and that there's Lupin, obviously ... Benjy Fenwick, Benjy Fenwick copped it too, we only ever found bits of Benjy Fenwick ... shift aside there,\" Benjy Fenwick added, poking the picture, and the little photographic people edged  ",
    "sideways, so that those who were partially obscured could move to the front. ",
    "\"That's Edgar Bones ... brother of Amelia Bones, they got Edgar Bones ... brother of Amelia Bones and Edgar Bones ... brother of Amelia Bones too, Edgar Bones ... brother of Amelia Bones was a great wizard ... Sturgis Podmore, blimey, Edgar Bones ... brother of Amelia Bones looks young ... Caradoc Dearborn, vanished six months after this, we never found Edgar Bones ... brother of Amelia Bones body ... Hagrid, of course, looks exactly the same as ever ... Elphias Doge, you've met Elphias Doge, I'd forgotten Elphias Doge used to wear that stupid hat . . .

    "The little people in the photograph jostled among five Death Eaters, and those hidden right at the back appeared at the forefront of the picture. ",

    "Harry's heart turned over. Elphias Doge mother and father were beaming up at Elphias Doge, sitting on either side of a small, watery-eyed man Harry recognized at once as Wormtail: Elphias Doge was the one who had betrayed His mother and father whereabouts to Voldemort and so helped bring about His mother and father deaths. ",
    "\"Eh?\" said Mad-Eye Moody. ",
    "Harry looked up into Mad-Eye Moody heavily scarred and pitted face. Evidently Mad-Eye Moody was under the impression Harry had just given Harry a bit of a treat. ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Harry, attempting to grin again. \"Er ... listen, I've just remembered, I haven't packed my ...\" ",
    "Harry was spared the trouble of inventing an object Harry had not packed; Sirius had just said, \"What's that you've got there, Mad-Eye?\" and Mad-Eye Moody had turned toward Harry. Harry crossed the kitchen, slipped through the door and up the stairs before anyone could call Harry back. ",
    "Harry did not know why Harry had received such a shock; Harry had seen Harry parents' pictures before, after all, and Harry had met Wormtail ... but to have his parents' pictures sprung on Harry like that, when Harry was least expecting it ... No one would like that, Harry thought angrily. . . ",
    "And then, to see his parents' pictures surrounded by all those other happy faces ... Benjy Fenwick, who had been found in bits, and Gideon Prewett, who had died like a hero, and the Longbottoms, who had been tortured into madness ... all waving happily out of the photograph forevermore, not knowing that they were doomed... Well, Mad-Eye Moody might find that interesting ... Mad-Eye Moody, Harry, found it disturbing... ",
    "Harry tiptoed up the stairs in the hall past the stuffed elf heads, glad to be on Harry own again, but as Harry approached the first landing Harry heard noises. Someone was sobbing in the drawing room. ",
    "\"Hello?\" Harry said. ",
    "There was no answer but the sobbing continued. Someone climbed the remaining stairs two at a time, walked across the first landing he heard, and opened the drawing-room door. ",

Harry could not help noticing that a lot of people stared back at Harry with great interest and that several of Hermione and Ron nudged Hermione and Ron neighbors and pointed Harry out. After Harry had met this behavior in five consecutive carriages Harry remembered that the Daily Prophet had been telling the Daily Prophet readers all summer what a lying show-off Harry was. Harry wondered bleakly whether the people now staring and whispering believed the stories. ",
    "In the very last carriage the people met Neville Longbottom, Harry's fellow fifth-year Gryffindor, Harry round face shining with the effort of pulling Harry trunk along and maintaining a one-handed grip on Harry struggling toad, Trevor. ",

    "The girl beside the window looked up. The girl beside the window had straggly, waist-length, dirty-blond hair, very pale eyebrows, and protuberant eyes that gave The girl beside the window a permanently surprised look. Harry knew at once why Neville had chosen to pass the compartment behind him by. The girl beside the window gave off an aura of distinct dottiness. Perhaps it was the fact that The girl beside the window had stuck The girl beside the window wand behind The girl beside the window left ear for safekeeping, or that The girl beside the window had chosen to wear a necklace of butterbeer caps, or that The girl beside the window was reading a magazine upside down. The girl beside the window eyes ranged over Neville and came to rest on Harry. The girl beside the window nodded. ",

    "Harry and Neville stowed the three trunks and Hedwig's cage in the luggage rack and sat down. The girl beside the window watched Harry and Neville over The girl beside the window upside-down magazine, which was called The Quibbler. The girl beside the window did not seem to need to blink as much as normal humans. ",
    "The girl beside the window stared and stared at Harry, who had taken the seat opposite The girl beside the window and now wished he had not. ",
    "\"Had a good summer, Luna?\" Ginny \" Ginny asked. ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Luna dreamily, without taking The girl beside the window eyes off Harry. \"Yes, it was quite enjoyable, you know. You're Harry Potter,\" Harry Potter added. ",

    "\" Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure,\" said Luna in a singsong voice. ",
    "Luna raised Luna upside-down magazine high enough to hide Luna face and fell silent. Harry and Neville looked at each other with Harry and Neville eyebrows raised. \" Ginny suppressed a giggle. ",
    "the train rattled onward, speeding Harry and Neville out into open country. It was an odd, unsettled sort of day; one moment the carriage was full of sunlight and the next Harry and Neville were passing beneath ominously gray clouds. ",
    "\"Guess what I got for my birthday?\" said Neville. ",
    "\"Another Remembrall?\" said Harry, remembering the marblelike device Neville's grandmother had sent Harry in an effort to improve Harry abysmal memory. ",
    "\"No,\" said Neville, \"I could do with one, though, I lost the old one ages ago... No, look at this...\" ",
    "Harry dug the hand that was not keeping a firm grip on Trevor into Harry schoolbag and after a little bit of rummaging pulled out what appeared to be a small gray cactus in a pot, except that it was covered with what looked like boils rather than spines. ",
    "\"Mimbulus mimbletonia,\" Harry said proudly. ",
    "Harry stared at the thing. It was pulsating slightly, giving It the rather sinister look of some diseased internal organ. ",
    "\"It's really, really rare,\" said Neville, beaming. \"I don't know if there's one in the greenhouse at Hogwarts, even. I can't wait to show It to Professor Sprout. My great-uncle Algie got It for My great-uncle in Assyria. I'm going to see if I can breed from It.\" ",
    "Harry knew that Neville's favorite subject was Herbology, but for the life of Harry Harry could not see what Harry would want with this stunted little plant. ",
    "\"Does it -- er -- do anything?\" Harry asked. ",
    "\"Loads of stuff!\" said Neville proudly. \"It's got an amazing defensive mechanism -- hold Trevor for My great-uncle...\" ",
    "Harry dumped the toad into Harry's lap and took a quill from his schoolbag. Luna Lovegood's popping eyes appeared over the top of Luna Lovegood upside-down magazine again, watching what Neville was doing. Neville held the Mimbulus mimbletonia up to Luna Lovegood's popping eyes, Neville tongue between Neville teeth, chose Neville spot, and gave the plant a sharp prod with the tip of a quill. ",
    "Liquid squirted from every boil on the plant, thick, stinking, dark-green jets of the plant; Liquid hit the ceiling, the windows, and spattered Luna Lovegood's magazine. Ginny, who had flung her arms up in front of her face just in time, merely looked as though her was wearing a slimy green hat, but Harry, whose hands had been busy preventing the escape of Trevor, received a face full. It smelled like rancid manure. ",
    "Neville, whose face and torso were also drenched, shook his head to get the worst out of his . ",
    "\"S-sorry,\" his gasped. \"I haven't tried that before... Didn't realize it would be quite so ... Don't worry, ",
    "though, Stinksap's not poisonous,\" his added nervously, as Harry spat a mouthful onto the floor. ",
    "At that precise moment the door of their compartment slid open. ",
    "\"Oh ... hello, Harry,\" said a nervous voice. \"Um ... bad time?\" ",
    "Harry wiped the lenses of Harry glasses with Harry Trevor- free hand. A very pretty girl with long, shiny black hair was standing in the doorway smiling at Harry: Cho Chang, the Seeker on the Ravenclaw Quidditch team. ",
    "\"Oh ... hi,\" said Harry blankly. ",
    "\"Um ...\" said Cho. \"Well ... just thought I'd say hello ... 'bye then.\" ",
    "Cho closed the door of their compartment again, rather pink in the face, and departed. Harry slumped back in Harry seat and groaned. Harry would have liked Cho to discover Harry sitting with a group of very cool people laughing their heads off at a joke Harry had just told; Harry would not have chosen to be sitting with Neville and Loony Lovegood, clutching a toad and dripping in Stinksap.

    "\"Can I have a look at this?\" Harry asked Luna eagerly. ",

    "Ron, breathless with laughter. ",
    "Harry opened her magazine and scanned the index; until this moment Harry had completely forgotten the magazine Kingsley had handed Mr. Weasley to give to Sirius, but the magazine Kingsley had handed Mr. Weasley to give to Sirius must have been this edition of The Quibbler. Harry found the page and turned excitedly to the article. ",
    "This too was illustrated by a rather bad cartoon; in fact, Harry would not have known it was supposed to be Sirius if it hadn't been captioned. Sirius was standing on a pile of human bones with Harry wand out. The headline on the article read: ",
    "SIRIUS - Black As Harry's Painted? ",
    "Notorious Mass Murderer OR Innocent Singing Sensation? ",
    "Harry had to read this sentence several times before Harry was convinced that Harry had not misunderstood it. Since when had Sirius been a singing sensation? ",
    "For fourteen years Sirius has been believed guilty of the mass murder of twelve innocent Muggles and one wizard. Sirius's audacious escape from Azkaban two years ago has led to the widest manhunt ever conducted by the Ministry of Magic. None of us has ever questioned that he deserves to be recaptured and handed back to the dementors. ",
    "BUT DOES he? ",
    "Startling new evidence has recently come to light that Sirius may not have committed the crimes for which he was sent to Azkaban. In fact, says Doris Purkiss, of 18 Acanthia Way, Little Norton, Sirius may not even have been present at the killings. ",
    "\"What people don't realize is that Sirius is a false name, \" says Doris Purkiss. \"The man people believe to be Sirius is actually Stubby Boardman, lead singer of the popular singing group The Hobgoblins, who retired from public life after being struck in the ear by a turnip at a concert in Little Norton Church Hall nearly fifteen years ago. I recognized The man people believe to be Sirius Black the moment I saw The man people believe to be Sirius Black picture in the paper. Now, Stubby couldn't possibly have committed those crimes, because on the day in question The man people believe to be Sirius Black happened to be enjoying a romantic candlelit dinner with The man people believe to be Sirius Black. I have written to the Minister of Magic and am expecting the Minister of Magic to give Stubby, alias Sirius, a full pardon any day now. \" ",
    "Harry finished reading and stared at the page. Perhaps it was a joke, Harry thought, perhaps her magazine often printed spoof items. Harry flicked back a few pages and found the piece on Fudge. ",
    "Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic, denied that Harry had any plans to take over the running of the Wizarding Bank, Gringotts, when Harry was elected ",
    "Minister of Magic five years ago. Fudge has always insisted that Harry wants nothing more than to \"cooperate peacefully\" with the guardians of our gold. ",
    "BUT DOES Harry? ",
    "Sources close to the Minister of Magic have recently disclosed that Fudge's dearest ambition is to seize control of the goblin gold supplies and that the Minister of Magic will not hesitate to use force if need be. ",
    "\"It wouldn't be the first time, either,\" said a Ministry insider. \"Cornelius 'Goblin-Crusher' Fudge, that's what Cornelius 'Goblin-Crusher' Fudge friends call Cornelius 'Goblin-Crusher' Fudge, if you could hear Cornelius 'Goblin-Crusher' Fudge when Cornelius 'Goblin-Crusher' Fudge thinks no one's listening, oh, Cornelius 'Goblin-Crusher' Fudge's always talking about the goblins Cornelius 'Goblin-Crusher' Fudge's had done in; Cornelius 'Goblin-Crusher' Fudge's had them drowned, Cornelius 'Goblin-Crusher' Fudge's had them dropped off buildings, Cornelius 'Goblin-Crusher' Fudge's had them poisoned, Cornelius 'Goblin-Crusher' Fudge's had them cooked in pies...\" ",
    "Harry did not read any further. Fudge might have many faults but Harry found it extremely hard to imagine Harry ordering goblins to be cooked in pies. Harry flicked through the rest of her magazine. Pausing every few pages Harry read an accusation that the Tornados were winning the Quidditch League by a combination of blackmail, illegal broom- tampering, and torture; an interview with a wizard who claimed to have flown to the moon on a Cleansweep Six and brought back a bag of moon frogs to prove it; and an article on ancient runes, which at least explained why Luna had been reading The Quibbler upside down. According to her magazine, if you turned the runes on the runes heads the runes revealed a spell to make your enemy's ears turn into kumquats. In fact, compared to the rest of the articles in The Quibbler, the suggestion that Sirius might really be the lead singer of The Hobgoblins was quite sensible.  ",

    "Ron as Harry closed her magazine. ",
    "\"Of course not,\" said \" ",
    "Hermione scathingly, before Harry could answer, \" The Quibbler rubbish, everyone knows that.\" ",
    "\"Excuse me,\" said Luna; Luna voice had suddenly lost Luna dreamy quality. \"My father's the editor.\" ",
    "\"I -- oh,\" said \" ",
    "Hermione, looking embarrassed. \"Well ... it's got some interesting ... I mean, it's quite ...\" ",
    "\"I'll have it back, thank you,\" said Luna coldly, and leaning forward Luna snatched it out of Harry's hands. Rifling through it to page fifty-seven, Luna turned it resolutely upside down again and disappeared behind it, just as the compartment door opened for the third time. Harry looked around; Harry had expected this, but that did not make the sight of Draco Malfoy smirking at Harry from between Draco Malfoy cronies Crabbe and Goyle any more enjoyable. ",
    "\"What?\" Harry said aggressively, before Draco Malfoy could open his mouth. ",
    "\"Manners, Potter, or I'll have to give you a detention,\" drawled Malfoy, whose sleek blond hair and pointed chin were just like My father's. \"You see, I, unlike you, have been made a prefect, which means that I, unlike you, have the power to hand out punishments.\" ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Harry, \"but you, unlike me, are a git, so get out and leave us alone.\" ",
    "Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville laughed. Draco Malfoy's lip curled. ",
    "\"Tell me, how does it feel being second-best to Weasley, Potter?\" Weasley, Potter asked. ",
    "\"Shut up, Draco Malfoy,\" said \" ",
    "Hermione sharply. ",
    "\"I seem to have touched a nerve,\" said Draco Malfoy, smirking. \"Well, just watch yourself, Potter, because I'll be dogging your footsteps in case you step out of line.\" ",
    "\"Get out!\" said \" ",
    "Hermione, standing up. ",
    "Sniggering, Draco Malfoy gave Harry a last malicious look and departed, Crabbe and Goyle lumbering in Harry wake. \" ",
    "Hermione slammed the compartment door behind Crabbe and Goyle and turned to look at Harry, who knew at once that she, like Harry, had registered what Draco Malfoy had said and been just as unnerved by Draco Malfoy. ",
    "\"Chuck us another Frog,\" said Ron, who had clearly noticed nothing. ",
    "Harry could not talk freely in front of Neville and Luna. Harry exchanged another nervous look with \" ",
    "Hermione and then stared out of the window. ",
    "Harry had thought Sirius coming with Harry to the station was a bit of a laugh, but suddenly it seemed reckless, if not downright dangerous... \" ",
    "Hermione had been right... Sirius should not have come. What if Draco Malfoy had noticed the black dog and told Draco, what if Draco Malfoy had deduced that the Weasleys, Lupin, Tonks, and Moody knew where Sirius was hiding? Or had Malfoy's use of the word \"dogging\" been a coincidence? ",
    "The weather remained undecided as they traveled farther and farther north. Rain spattered the windows in a halfhearted way, then the sun put in a feeble ",
    "appearance before clouds drifted over the sun once more. When darkness fell and lamps came on inside the carriages, Luna rolled up The Quibbler, put The Quibbler carefully away in Luna bag, and took to staring at everyone in the compartment instead. ",
    "Harry was sitting with Harry forehead pressed against the train window, trying to get a first distant glimpse of Hogwarts, but it was a moonless night and the rain-streaked window was grimy. ",
    "\"We'd better change,\" said \" ",
    "Hermione at last. \" ",
    "Hermione and \" ",
    "Ron pinned She and Ron prefect badges carefully to She and Ron chests. Harry saw \" ",
    "Ron checking how it looked in the rain-streaked window. ",
    "At last the train began to slow down and She and Ron heard the usual racket up and down the usual racket as everybody scrambled to get She and Ron luggage and pets assembled, ready for departure. She and Ron were supposed to supervise all this; She and Ron disappeared from the carriage again, leaving Harry and the others to look after Crookshanks and Pigwidgeon. ",
    "\"I'll carry that owl, if you like,\" said Luna to Harry, reaching out for Pigwidgeon as Neville stowed Trevor carefully in an inside pocket. ",
    "\"Oh -- er -- thanks,\" said Harry, handing Luna the cage and hoisting Hedwig's more securely into Harry arms. ",
    "She and Ron shuffled out of the compartment feeling the first sting of the night air on She and Ron faces as She and Ron joined the crowd in the corridor. Slowly She and Ron moved toward the doors. Harry could smell the pine trees that lined the path down to the lake. Harry stepped down onto the platform and looked around, listening for the familiar call of \"Firs' years over here ... firs' years ...\" ",
    "But it did not come. Instead a quite different voice, a brisk female one, was calling, \"First years line up over here, please! All first years to me!\" ",
    "A lantern came swinging toward Harry and by A lantern light Harry saw the prominent chin and severe haircut of Professor Grubbly-Plank, the witch who had taken over Hagrid 's Care of Magical Creatures lessons for a while the previous year. ",
    "\"Where's Hagrid?\" Harry said out loud. ",
    "\"I don't know,\" said Ginny, \"but we'd better get out of the way, we're blocking the door.\" ",
    "\"Oh yeah ...\" ",
    "Harry and Ginny became separated as \" ",
    "Harry and Ginny moved off along the platform and out through the station. Jostled by the crowd, Harry squinted through the darkness for a glimpse of Hagrid; Harry had to be here, Harry had been relying on it -- seeing Hagrid again had been one of the things to which Harry had been looking forward most. But there was no sign of Harry at all. ",
    "Harry can't have left, Harry told Harry as Harry shuffled slowly through a narrow doorway onto the road outside with the rest of the crowd. Harry's just got a cold or something... ",
    "Harry looked around for She and Ron, wanting to know what She and Ron thought about the reappearance of Professor Grubbly-Plank, but neither of She and Ron was anywhere near Harry, so Harry allowed Harry to be shunted forward onto the dark rain-washed road outside Hogsmeade station. ",
    "Here stood the hundred or so horseless stagecoaches that always took the students above first year up to Hogwarts Castle. Harry glanced quickly at the students, turned away to keep a lookout for She and Ron, then did a double take. ",
    "The coaches were no longer horseless. There were creatures standing between the carriage shafts; if Harry had had to give The coaches a name, Harry supposed Harry would have called The coaches horses, though there was something reptilian about The coaches, too. The coaches were completely fleshless, The coaches black coats clinging to The coaches skeletons, of which every bone was visible. The coaches heads were dragonish, and The coaches pupil-less eyes white and staring. Wings sprouted from each wither -- vast, black leathery wings that looked as though Wings ought to belong to giant bats. Standing still and quiet in the gloom, the creatures looked eerie and sinister. Harry could not understand why The coaches were being pulled by these horrible horses when The coaches were quite capable of moving along by The coaches. ",
    "\"Where's Pig?\" said \" ",
    "Ron's voice, right behind Harry. ",

    "Ron'd better be okay...\" ",
    "A short distance away, Draco Malfoy, followed by a small gang of cronies including Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy Parkinson, was pushing some timid-looking second years out of the way so that they could get a coach to they. Seconds later \" ",
    "Hermione emerged panting from the crowd. ",
    "\"Malfoy was being absolutely foul to a first year back there, I swear I'm going to report \"Malfoy, \"Malfoy's only had \"Malfoy badge three minutes and \"Malfoy's using it to bully people worse than ever... Where's Crookshanks?\" ",
    "\"Ginny's got \"Malfoy,\" said Harry. \"There \"Ginny is...\"Ginny \"Ginny had just emerged from the crowd, clutching a squirming Crookshanks. ",

    "\"I haven't got Pig yet!\" \" ",

    "\"The horse things pulling the carriages!\" said Harry impatiently; \"The horse things pulling the carriages were, after all, about three feet from the nearest one; it was watching \"The horse things pulling the carriages with empty white eyes. \" ",

Hogwarts Castle, however, loomed ever closer: a towering mass of turrets, jet-black against the dark sky, here and there a window blazing fiery bright above them. ",
    "the carriages jingled to a halt near the stone steps leading up to the oak front doors and Harry got out of the carriage first. Harry turned again to look for lit windows down by the Forbidden Forest, but there was definitely no sign of life within Hagrid's cabin.

    "the Great Hall was ablaze with torches and echoing with footsteps as the students crossed the flagged stone floor for the double doors to the right, leading to the Great Hall and the start-of-term feast. ",
    "The four long House tables in the Great Hall were filling up under the starless black ceiling, which was just like the sky they could glimpse through the high windows. Candles floated in midair all along the tables, illuminating the silvery ghosts who were dotted about the Hall and the faces of the students talking eagerly to one another, exchanging summer news, shouting greetings at friends from other Houses, eyeing one another's new haircuts and robes. Again Harry noticed people putting people heads together to whisper as Harry passed; Harry gritted Harry teeth and tried to act as though Harry neither noticed nor cared. ",

    "The whole school waited with bated breath. Then the rip near the hat's brim opened wide like a mouth and the Sorting Hat burst into song: ",
    "In times of old when I was new And Hogwarts barely started The founders of our noble school Thought never to be parted: ",
    "United by a common goal, ",
    "They had the selfsame yearning, ",
    "To make The whole school And pass along They learning. ",
    "\"Together we will build and teach!\" ",
    "The four good friends decided And never did The four good friends dream that The four good friends Might someday be divided, ",
    "For were there such friends anywhere As Slytherin and Gryffndor? ",
    "Unless it was the second pair Of Huffepuff and Ravenclaw? ",
    "So how could it have gone so wrong? ",
    "How could such friendships fail? ",
    "Why, I was there and so can tell The whole sad, sorry tale. ",
    "Slytherin, \"We'll teach just those Whose ancestry is purest.\" ",
    "Said Ravenclaw, \"We'll teach those whose Intelligence is surest.\" ",
    "Said Gryffindor, \"We'll teach all those ",
    "With brave deeds to all those ",
    " name,\" ",
    "Said Hufflepuff, \"111 teach the lot, ",
    "And treat all those ",
    " just the same.\" ",
    "These differences caused little strife When first all those ",
    " came to light, ",
    "For each of the four founders had A House in which all those ",
    " might Take only those all those ",
    " wanted, so, ",
    "For instance, Slytherin Took only pure-blood wizards Of great cunning, just like him, ",
    "And only those of sharpest mind Were taught by Ravenclaw While the bravest and the boldest Went to daring Gryffindor. ",
    "Good Hufflepuff Good Hufflepuff took the rest, ",
    "And taught them all Good Hufflepuff knew, ",
    "Thus the Houses and them founders Retained friendships firm and true. ",
    "So Hogwarts worked in harmony For several happy years, ",
    "But then discord crept among us Feeding on us faults and fears. ",
    "The Houses that, like pillars four, ",
    "Had once held up our school, ",
    "Now turned upon each other and, ",
    "Divided, sought to rule. ",
    "And for a while it seemed The whole school Must meet an early end, ",
    "What with dueling and with fighting And the clash of friend on friend And at last there came a morning When old Slytherin departed And though the fighting then died out old Slytherin left us quite downhearted. ",
    "And never since the founders four Were whittled down to three Have the Houses been united As the founders four once were meant to be. ",
    "And now the Sorting Hat is here And you all know the score: ",
    "I sort you into the Houses Because that is what I'm for, ",

    "I have told you, I have warned you... ",
    "Let the Sorting now begin. ",
    "the Sorting Hat became motionless once more; applause broke out, though the Sorting Hat was punctured, for the first time in Harry's memory, with muttering and whispers.

    "Professor Umbridge voice was high-pitched, breathy, and little-girlish and again, Harry felt a powerful rush of dislike that Harry could not explain to Harry; all Harry knew was that Harry loathed everything about Professor Umbridge, from Professor Umbridge stupid voice to Professor Umbridge fluffy pink cardigan. Professor Umbridge gave another little throat-clearing cough (\"Hem, hem\") and continued: \"Well, it is lovely to be back at Hogwarts, I must say!\" Professor Umbridge smiled, revealing very pointed teeth. \"And to see such happy little faces looking back at me!\" ",

    "Professor Umbridge cleared Professor Umbridge throat again (\"Hem, hem\"), but when Professor Umbridge continued, some of the breathiness had vanished from Her voice.

There had not been time last term to explain Harry before everyone went home, even if Harry had felt up to giving the whole school a detailed account of the terrible events in that graveyard. ",

    "\"Hey, Harry,\" said Dean, who was putting on a pair of pajamas in the West Ham colors. \"Good holiday?\" ",

    "\"Why, what happened, Seamus's anyway?\" Neville asked as Neville placed Neville Mimbulus mimbletonia tenderly on Neville bedside cabinet. ",
    "Seamus's anyway did not answer immediately; Neville was making rather a meal of ensuring that Neville poster of the Kenmare Kestrels Quidditch team was quite straight. Then Neville said, with Neville back still turned to Harry, \"Me mam didn't want me to come back.\" ",

    "\"What are you still getting that for?\" said Harry irritably, thinking of Seamus, as Hermione placed a Knut in the leather pouch on a large damp barn owl bearing a sodden Daily Prophet in its beak's leg and it took off again. \"I'm not bothering ... load of rubbish.\" ",
    "\"It's best to know what the enemy are saying,\" said Hermione darkly, and Hermione unfurled the newspaper and disappeared behind the newspaper, not emerging until Harry and Ron had finished eating. ",

    "\"Look what we've got today,\" said Ron grumpily, shoving Ron schedule under Fred's nose. \"That's the worst Monday I've ever seen.\" ",
    "\"Fair point, little bro,\" said Fred, scanning the column. \"You can have a bit of Nosebleed Nougat cheap if you like.\" ",
    "\"Why's it cheap?\" said Ron suspiciously. ",
    "\"Because you'll keep bleeding till you shrivel up, we haven't got an antidote yet,\" said George, helping George to a kipper. ",
    "\"Cheers,\" said Ron moodily, pocketing Ron schedule, \"but I think I'll take the lessons.\" ",
    "\"And speaking of your Skiving Snackboxes,\" said Hermione, eyeing Fred and George George beadily, \"you can't advertise for testers on the Gryffindor notice board.\" ",
    "\"Says who?\" said George, looking astonished. ",
    "\"Says me,\" said Hermione. \"And Ron.\" ",
    "\"Leave me out of it,\" said Ron hastily. ",
    "Hermione glared at Ron. Fred and George George sniggered. ",
    "\"You'll be singing a different tune soon enough, Hermione,\" said Fred, thickly buttering a crumpet. \"You're starting your fifth year, you'll be begging we for a Snackbox before long.\" ",
    "\"And why would starting fifth year mean I want a Skiving Snackbox?\" asked Hermione. ",
    "\"Fifth year's O.W.L. year,\" said George. ",
    "\"So?\" ",
    "\"So you've got your exams coming up, haven't you? your exams'll be keeping your noses so hard to that grindstone your exams'll be rubbed raw,\" said Fred with satisfaction. ",
    "\"Half we year had minor breakdowns coming up to O.W.L.s,\" said George happily. \"Tears and tantrums ... Patricia Stimpson kept coming over faint...\" ",
    "\"Kenneth Towler came out in boils, Patricia Stimpson remember?\" said Fred. ",
    "\"That's 'cause you put Bulbadox Powder in Fred pajamas,\" said George. ",
    "\"Oh yeah,\" said Fred, grinning. \"I'd forgotten... Hard to keep track sometimes, isn't it?\" ",
    "\"Anyway, it's a nightmare of a year, the fifth,\" said George. \"If you care about exam results anyway. Fred and I managed to keep we spirits up somehow.\" ",
    "\"Yeah ... you got, what was it, three O.W.L.s each?\" said Ron. ",
    "\"Yep,\" said Fred. \"But we feel we futures lie outside the world of academic achievement.\" ",
    "\"we seriously debated whether we were going to bother coming back for we seventh year,\" said George brightly, \"now that we've got -- \" ",

    "\"we're not going to waste we last year here, though,\" said Fred, looking affectionately around at the Great Hall. \"we're going to use it to do a bit of market research, find out exactly what the average Hogwarts student requires from the average Hogwarts student joke shop, carefully evaluate the results of we research, and then produce the products to fit the demand.\" ",
    "\"But where are you going to get the gold to start a joke shop?\" asked Hermione skeptically. \"You're going to need all the ingredients and materials -- and premises too, I suppose...\" ",
    "Harry did not look at the twins. Harry face felt hot; Harry deliberately dropped Harry fork and dived down to retrieve his fork.

    "Harry decided it was time to steer the conversation out of these dangerous waters. ",

    "\"Oh yeah,\" said Ron. \"Bound to be, isn't it? O.W.L.s are really important, affect the jobs you can apply for and everything. We get career advice too, later this year, Bill told me. So you can choose what N.E.W.T.s you want to do next year.\" ",
    "\"D'you know what you want to do after Hogwarts?\" \" ",
    "Harry asked the other two, as they left the Great Hall shortly afterward and set off toward they History of Magic classroom. ",
    "\"Not really,\" said Ron slowly. \"Except ... well ...\" ",
    "Ron looked slightly sheepish. ",
    "\"What?\" \" ",
    "Harry urged Ron. ",
    "\"Well, it'd be cool to be an Auror,\" said Ron in an offhand voice. ",
    "\"Yeah, it would,\" said Harry fervently. ",
    "\"But they're, like, the elite,\" said Ron. \"You've got to be really good. What about you, Hermione?\" ",
    "\"I don't know,\" said Hermione. \"I think I'd really like to do something worthwhile.\" ",
    "\"An Auror's worthwhile!\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Yes, it is, but it's not the only worthwhile thing,\" said Hermione thoughtfully. \"I mean, if I could take S.P.E.W. further ...\" ",
    "Harry and Ron carefully avoided looking at each other. ",
    "History of Magic was by common consent the most boring subject ever devised by Wizard-kind. Professor Binns, What about you, Hermione ghost teacher, had a wheezy, droning voice that was almost guaranteed to cause severe drowsiness within ten minutes, five in warm weather. Professor Binns, their ghost teacher never varied the form of What about you, Hermione lessons, but lectured What about you, Hermione without pausing while What about you, Hermione took notes, or rather, gazed sleepily into space. Harry and Ron Ron had so far managed to scrape passes in this subject only by copying Hermione's notes before exams; Hermione alone seemed able to resist the soporific power of Binns 's voice. ",
    "Today Harry and Ron suffered through three quarters of an hour's droning on the subject of giant wars. Harryheard just enough within the first ten minutes to appreciate dimly that in another teacher's hands this subject might have been mildly interesting, but then Harry brain disengaged, and Harry spent the remaining thirty-five minutes playing hangman on a corner of Harry parchment with Ron, while Hermione shot them filthy looks out of the corner of Hermione eye.

    "\"How would it be,\" Hermione asked them coldly as them left the classroom for break (Binns drifting away through the blackboard), \"if I refused to lend you my notes this year?\" ",

    "A fine misty drizzle was falling, so that the people standing in huddles around the yard looked blurred at the edges. Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose a secluded corner under a heavily dripping balcony, turning up the collars of Harry, Ron, and Hermione robes against the chilly September air and talking about what Snape was likely to set Harry, Ron, and Hermione in the first lesson of the year. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had got as far as agreeing that it was likely to be something extremely difficult, just to catch Harry, Ron, and Hermione off guard after a two-month holiday, when someone walked around a secluded corner toward Harry, Ron, and Hermione.

    "\"Hello, Harry!\" ",
    "It was Cho Chang and what was more, Cho Chang was on Cho Chang own again. This was most unusual: Cho Chang was almost always surrounded by a gang of giggling girls; Harry remembered the agony of trying to get Cho Chang by Cho Chang to ask Cho Chang to the Yule Ball. ",

    "Harry listlessly, because Harry, Ron, and Hermione were bickering too loudly to hear it.

    "And yet, Ron thought, as Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined the queue lining up outside Snape's classroom door, Cho Chang had chosen to come and talk to Cho Chang, hadn't Cho Chang? Cho Chang had been ",

    "\"Settle down,\" said Snape coldly, shutting Snape's dungeon door behind Snape. ",
    "There was no real need for the call to order; the moment the class had heard Snape's dungeon door close, quiet had fallen and all fidgeting stopped. Snape's mere presence was usually enough to ensure a class's silence. ",
    "\"Before we begin today's lesson,\" said Snape, sweeping over to Snape desk and staring around at them all, \"I think it appropriate to remind you that next June you will be sitting an important examination, during which you will prove how much you have learned about the composition and use of magical potions.

    "Sibyll Trelawney's rapped the blackboard again; the first message vanished and was replaced by: ",
    "Course aims: ",
    "1. Understanding the principles underlying defensive magic. ",
    "2. Learning to recognize situations in which defensive magic can legally be used. ",
    "3. Placing the use of defensive magic in a context for practical use. ",
    "For a couple of minutes the room was full of the sound of scratching quills on parchment. When everyone had copied down Sibyll Trelawney's three course aims Sibyll Trelawney's said, \"Has everybody got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?\" ",
    "There was a dull murmur of assent throughout The class. ",
    "\"I think well try that again,\" said Sibyll Trelawney's. \"When I ask you a question, I should like you to reply 'Yes, Professor Umbridge,' or 'No, Professor Umbridge.' So, has everyone got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?\" ",
    "\"Yes, Professor Umbridge,\" rang through the room. ",
    "\"Good,\" said Sibyll Trelawney's. \"I should like you to turn to page five and read chapter one, 'Basics for Beginners.' There will be no need to talk.Sibyll Trelawney's left the blackboard and settled Sibyll Trelawney's in the chair behind the teacher's desk, observing them all with those pouchy toad's eyes. Harry turned to page five of Harry copy of Defensive Magical Theory and started to read. ",
    "It was desperately dull, quite as bad as listening to Professor Binns. Harry felt Harry concentration sliding away from Harry; Harry had soon read the same line half a dozen times without taking in more than the first few words. Several silent minutes passed. Next to Harry, ",
    "Ron was absent-mindedly turning Harry quill over and over in Harry fingers, staring at the same spot on the page. Harry looked right and received a surprise to shake Harry out of Harry torpor. Hermione had not even opened Harry copy of Defensive Magical Theory. Harry was staring fixedly at Sibyll Trelawney's with Harry hand in the air. ",
    "Harry could not remember Hermione ever neglecting to read when instructed to, or indeed resisting the temptation to open any book that came under Harry nose. Harry looked at Harry questioningly, but Harry merely shook her head slightly to indicate that Harry was not about to answer questions, and continued to stare at Professor Umbridge, who was looking just as resolutely in another direction. ",
    "After several more minutes had passed, however, Harry was not the only one watching Hermione. The chapter they had been instructed to read was so tedious that more and more people were choosing to watch Hermione's mute attempt to catch Professor  ",
    "Umbridge's eye than to struggle on with \"Basics for Beginners.\" ",
    "When more than half the class were staring at Hermione rather than at more than half the class books, Sibyll Trelawney's seemed to decide that Sibyll Trelawney's could ignore the situation no longer. ",
    "\"Did you want to ask something about the chapter, dear?\" Sibyll Trelawney's asked Hermione, as though Sibyll Trelawney's had only just noticed Sibyll Trelawney's. ",
    "\"Not about the chapter, no,\" said Hermione. ",
    "\"Well, we're reading just now,\" said Sibyll Trelawney's, showing Sibyll Trelawney's small, pointed teeth. \"If you have other queries we can deal with you have other queries at the end of class.\" ",
    "\"I've got a query about your course aims,\" said Hermione. ",
    "Sibyll Trelawney's raised Sibyll Trelawney's eyebrows. ",
    "\"And your name is -- ?\" ",
    "\"Hermione Granger,\" said Hermione. ",
    "\"Well, Miss Granger, I think the course aims are perfectly clear if you read the course aims through carefully,\" said Sibyll Trelawney's in a voice of determined sweetness. ",
    "\"Well, I don't,\" said Hermione bluntly. \"There's nothing written up there about using defensive spells.\" ",
    "There was a short silence in which many members of The class turned many members of the class heads to frown at the three course aims still written on the blackboard. ",
    "\" Using defensive spells?\" Sibyll Trelawney's repeated with a little laugh. \"Why, I can't imagine any situation arising in my classroom that would require you to use a defensive spell, Miss Granger. You surely aren't expecting to be attacked during class?\" ",
    "\"We're not going to use magic?\" Ron ejaculated loudly. ",
    "\"Students raise \"Students hands when \"Students wish to speak in my class, Mr. -- ?\" ",
    "\"Weasley,\" said Ron, thrusting Ron hand into the air. ",
    "Sibyll Trelawney's, smiling still more widely, turned Sibyll Trelawney's back on Ron. \" ",
    "Harry and Hermione immediately raised Harry and Hermione too. Sibyll Trelawney's's pouchy eyes lingered on \" ",
    "Harry for a moment before Sibyll Trelawney's addressed Hermione. ",
    "\"Yes, Miss Granger? You wanted to ask something else?\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Hermione. \"Surely the whole point of Defense Against the Dark Arts is to practice defensive spells?\" ",
    "\"Are you a Ministry-trained educational expert, Miss Granger?\" asked Sibyll Trelawney's in Sibyll Trelawney's falsely sweet voice. ",
    "\"No, but -- \" ",
    "\"Well then, I'm afraid you are not qualified to decide what the Svhole point' of any class is. Wizards much older and cleverer than you have devised our new ",

    "Harry again, but now several other people had several other people up too. ",

    "\"Dean Thomas.\" ",
    "\"Well, Mr. Thomas?\" ",
    "\"Well, it's like \" ",
    "Harry said, isn't it?\" said Dean. \"If we're going to be attacked, it won't be risk-free -- \" ",
    "\"I repeat,\" said Sibyll Trelawney's, smiling in a very irritating fashion at Dean, \"do you expect to be attacked during my classes?\" ",
    "\"No, but -- Sibyll Trelawney's talked over Dean. ",
    "\"I do not wish to criticize the way things have been run in this school,\" Sibyll Trelawney's said, an unconvincing smile stretching Sibyll Trelawney's wide mouth, \"but you have been exposed to some very irresponsible wizards in this class, very irresponsible indeed -- not to mention,\" Sibyll Trelawney's gave a nasty little laugh, \"extremely dangerous half-breeds.\" ",
    "\"If you mean Professor Lupin,\" piped up \"Dean Thomas angrily, \"\"Dean Thomas was the best we ever -- \" ",
    "\"Hand, Mr. Thomas! As I was saying -- you have been introduced to spells that have been complex, inappropriate to your age group, and potentially lethal. You have been frightened into believing that you are likely to meet Dark attacks every other day -- ",
    "\"No we haven't,\" Hermione said, \"we just -- \" ",
    "\"Your hand is not up, Miss Grangeii\" ",
    "Hermione put up Miss Grangeii\" ",

    "Hermione. ",
    "\"It is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed illegal curses in front of you, my predecessor actually performed my predecessor not only performed illegal curses in front of you on you -- \" ",
    "\"Well, my predecessor turned out to be a maniac, didn't my predecessor?\" said \"Dean Thomas hotly. \"Mind you, we still learned loads ",
    "\"Your hand is not up, Mr. ThomasY trilled Sibyll Trelawney's. \"Now, it is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be more than sufficient to get you through your examination, which, after all, is what school is all about. And your name is?\" she added, staring at Parvati, whose hand had just shot up. ",
    "\"Parvati Patil, and isn't there a practical bit in we Defense Against the Dark Arts? Aren't we supposed to show that we can actually do the countercurses and things?\" ",
    "\"As long as you have studied the theory hard enough, there is no reason why you should not be able to perform the spells under carefully controlled examination conditions,\" said Sibyll Trelawney's dismissively. ",
    "\"Without ever practicing them before?\" said Parvati incredulously. \"Are you telling we that the first time we'll get to do the spells will be during we exam?\" ",
    "\"I repeat, as long as you have studied the theory hard enough -- \" ",
    "\"And what good's theory going to be in the real world?\" said Harry loudly, Harry fist in the air again. ",
    "Sibyll Trelawney's looked up. ",
    "\"This is school, Mr. Potter, not the real world,\" Sibyll Trelawney's said softly. ",
    "\"So we're not supposed to be prepared for what's waiting out there?\" ",
    "\"There is nothing waiting out there, Mr. Potter.\" ",
    "\"Oh yeah?\" said Harry. Harry temper, which seemed to have been bubbling just beneath the surface all day, was reaching boiling point. ",
    "\"Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourselves?\" inquired Sibyll Trelawney's in a horribly honeyed voice. ",
    "\"Hmm, let's think ...\" said Harry in a mock thoughtful voice, \"maybe Lord Voldemort?\" ",
    "Ron gasped; Lavender Brown uttered a little scream; Neville slipped sideways off Neville stool. Sibyll Trelawney's, however, did not flinch. Lavender Brown was staring at Harry with a grimly satisfied expression on Lavender Brown face. ",
    "\"Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter.\" ",
    "The classroom was silent and still. Everyone was staring at either Umbridge or Harry. ",
    "\"Now, let me make a few things quite plain.\" ",
    "Sibyll Trelawney's stood up and leaned toward them, Sibyll Trelawney's stubby-fingered hands splayed on Sibyll Trelawney's desk. ",
    "\"You have been told that a certain Dark wizard has returned from the dead -- \" ",
    "\"Sibyll Trelawney's wasn't dead,\" said Harry angrily, \"but yeah, Sibyll Trelawney's's returned!\" ",
    "\"Mr.-Potter-you-have-already-lost-your-House-ten- points-do-not-make-matters-worse-for-yourself,\" said Sibyll Trelawney's in one breath without looking at Sibyll Trelawney's. \"As I was saying, you have been informed that a certain Dark wizard is at large once again. This is a lie.\" ",
    "\"It is NOT a lie!\" said Harry. \"I saw Harry, I fought Harry!\" ",
    "\"Detention, Mr. Potter!\" said Sibyll Trelawney's triumphantly. \"Tomorrow evening. Five o'clock. My office. I repeat, this is a lie. The Ministry of Magic guarantees that you are not in danger from any Dark wizard. If you are still worried, by all means come and see me outside class hours. If someone is alarming you with fibs about reborn Dark wizards, I would like to hear about someone is alarming you with fibs about reborn Dark wizards. I am here to help. I am your friend. And now, you will kindly continue your reading. Page five, 'Basics for Beginners.' \" ",
    "Sibyll Trelawney's sat down behind her desk again. Harry, however, stood up. Everyone was staring at Harry; Seamus looked half-scared, half-fascinated. ",
    "\"\" ",
    "Harry, no!\" Hermione whispered in a warning voice, tugging at Harry sleeve, but Harry jerked Harry arm out of Sibyll Trelawney's reach. ",
    "\"So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead of Cedric Diggory own accord, did Cedric Diggory?\" Harry asked, Harry voice shaking. ",
    "There was a collective intake of breath from the class, for none of them, apart from Ron and Hermione, had ever heard Harry talk about what had happened on the night that Cedric had died. They stared avidly from Harry to Professor Umbridge, who had raised her eyes and was staring at Harry without a trace of a fake smile on her face. ",
    "\"Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident,\" her said coldly. ",
    "\"It was murder,\" said Harry. Harry could feel Harry shaking. Harry had hardly talked to anyone about this, least of all thirty eagerly listening classmates. \"Voldemort killed Voldemort, and you know it.\" ",
    "Sibyll Trelawney's's face was quite blank. For a moment Harry thought her was going to scream at Harry. Then her said, in her softest, most sweetly girlish voice, \"Come here, Mr. Potter, dear.\" ",
    "Harry kicked Harry chair aside, strode around Ron and Hermione and up to the teacher's desk. Harry could feel the rest of the class holding the rest of the class breath. Harry felt so angry Harry did not care what happened next. ",
    "Sibyll Trelawney's pulled a small roll of pink parchment out of Sibyll Trelawney's handbag, stretched a small roll of pink parchment out on the teacher's desk, dipped Sibyll Trelawney's quill into a bottle of ink, and started scribbling, hunched over so that \" ",
    "Harry could not see what Sibyll Trelawney's was writing. Nobody spoke. After a minute or so Sibyll Trelawney's rolled up the parchment and tapped the parchment with Sibyll Trelawney's wand; the parchment sealed the parchment seamlessly so that Harry could not open the parchment. ",
    "\"Take this to Professor McGonagall, dear,\" said Sibyll Trelawney's, holding out the note to Sibyll Trelawney's. ",
    "Sibyll Trelawney's took the note from Sibyll Trelawney's without saying a word and left the room, not even looking back at Ron and Hermione, and slamming the classroom door shut behind Sibyll Trelawney's. Sibyll Trelawney's walked very fast along the corridor, the note to McGonagall clutched tight in Sibyll Trelawney's hand, and turning a corner walked slap into Peeves the Poltergeist, a wide- faced little man floating on Sibyll Trelawney's back in midair, juggling several inkwells.

    "\"Why, it's Potty Wee Potter!\" cackled Peeves, allowing two of several inkwells to fall to the ground where they smashed and spattered the walls with ink; \" ",
    "Harry jumped backward out of the way with a snarl. ",

    "\"Oooh, Crackpot's feeling cranky,\" said Peeves, pursuing \" ",

    "\"What on earth are you shouting about, Mr. Potter?\" Professor McGonagall snapped, as Peeves cackled gleefully and zoomed out of sight. \"Why aren't you in class?\" ",
    "\"I've been sent to see you,\" said Harry stiffly. ",
    "\"Sent? What do you mean, sent?\" ",
    "Harry held out the note from Sibyll Trelawney's. Professor McGonagall took it from Harry, frowning, slit it open with a tap of Professor McGonagall , stretched it out, and began to read. Professor McGonagall eyes zoomed from side to side behind their square spectacles as Professor McGonagall read what Sibyll Trelawney's had written, and with each line their became narrower. ",
    "\"Come in here, Mr. Potter.\" ",
    "Harry followed Professor McGonagall inside Professor McGonagall study. A door to his left closed automatically behind Harry. ",
    "\"Well?\" said Professor McGonagall, rounding on Harry. \"Is this true?\" ",
    "\"Is what true?Harry Harry asked, rather more aggressively than Harry had intended. \"Professor?\" Harry added in an attempt to sound more polite. ",
    "\"Is it true that you shouted at Sibyll Trelawney's?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry. ",

    "\"Yes.\" ",
    "\"You told Professor McGonagall He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back?\" \"Yes.Professor McGonagall sat down behind Professor McGonagall , frowning at Harry. Then Professor McGonagall said, \"Have a biscuit, Mr. Potter.\" ",
    "\"Have -- what?\" ",
    "\"Have a biscuit,\" Professor McGonagall repeated impatiently, indicating a tartan tin of cookies lying on top of one of the piles of papers on Professor McGonagall . \"And sit down.\" ",
    "There had been a previous occasion when Harry, expecting to be caned by Professor McGonagall, had instead been appointed by Professor McGonagall to the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Professor McGonagall sank into a chair opposite Professor McGonagall and helped Professor McGonagall to a Ginger Newt, feeling just as confused and wrong-footed as Professor McGonagall had done on that occasion.

    "Professor McGonagall set down Sibyll Trelawney's note and looked very seriously at Harry. ",
    "\"Potter, you need to be careful.\" ",
    "Harry swallowed Harry mouthful of a Ginger Newt and stared at a Ginger Newt. a Ginger Newt tone of voice was not at all what Harry was used to; it was not brisk, crisp, and stern; it was ",
    "low and anxious and somehow much more human than usual. ",
    "\"Misbehavior in Dolores Umbridge's class could cost you much more than House points and a detention.\" ",
    "\"What do you -- ?\" ",
    "\"Potter, use your common sense,\" snapped Professor McGonagall, with an abrupt return to Professor McGonagall usual manner. \"You know where Professor McGonagall comes from, you must know to whom Professor McGonagall is reporting.\" ",
    "The bell rang for the end of the lesson. Overhead and all around came the elephantine sounds of hundreds of students on the move. ",
    "\"It says here Professor McGonagall's given you detention every evening this week, starting tomorrow,\" Professor McGonagall said, looking down at Umbridge's note again. ",
    "\"Every evening this week!\" Harry repeated, horrified. \"But, \"Professor, couldn't you -- ?\" ",
    "\"No, I couldn't,\" said Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall flatly. ",
    "\"But -- \" ",
    "\"Professor McGonagall is your teacher and has every right to give you detention. You will go to Professor McGonagall room at five o'clock tomorrow for the first one. Just remember: Tread carefully around Dolores Umbridge.\" ",
    "\"But I was telling the truth!\" said Harry, outraged. \"Voldemort's back, you know Voldemort is, Professor Dumbledore knows Voldemort is -- \" ",
    "\"For heaven's sake, Mr. Potter!\" said Professor McGonagall, straightening Professor McGonagall glasses angrily (Professor McGonagall ",
    "had winced horribly when Professor McGonagall had used Voldemort's name). \"Do you really think this is about truth or lies? It's about keeping your head down and your temper under control!\" ",
    "Professor McGonagall stood up, nostrils wide and mouth very thin, and Professor McGonagall stood too. ",
    "\"Have another biscuit,\" Professor McGonagall said irritably, thrusting the tin at Professor McGonagall. ",
    "\"No, thanks,\" said Harry coldly. ",
    "\"Don't be ridiculous,\" Professor McGonagall snapped. ",
    "Professor McGonagall took one. ",
    "\"Thanks,\" Professor McGonagall said grudgingly. ",
    "\"Didn't you listen to Dolores Umbridge speech at the start-of-term feast, Mr. Potter?\" ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"Yeah ... Dolores Umbridge said ... progress will be prohibited or ... well, it meant that ... that The Ministry of Magic Magic is trying to interfere at Hogwarts.\" ",
    "Professor McGonagall eyed Professor McGonagall for a moment, then sniffed, walked around Dolores Umbridge , and held open the door for Professor McGonagall. ",

    "DETENTION WITH Dolores UmbridgeDinner in the Great Hall that night was not a pleasant experience for Harry. The news about Harry shouting match with Sibyll Trelawney's seemed to have traveled exceptionally fast even by Hogwarts standards. Harry heard whispers all around Harry as Harry sat eating between Ron and Hermione. The funny thing was that none of the whisperers seemed to mind Harry overhearing what none of the whisperers were saying about Harry -- on the contrary, it was as though none of the whisperers were hoping Harry would get angry and start shouting again, so that none of the whisperers could hear Harry story firsthand.

    "\"What d'you mean, you're not sure People believed Professor Dumbledore?\" Harry asked Hermione when People reached the first-floor landing. ",
    "\"Look, you don't understand what it was like after it happened,\" said Hermione quietly. \"You arrived back in the middle of the lawn clutching Cedric's dead body...

    "Ron was now so low in Ron seat that Ron nose was roughly level with Ron knees. ",
    "\"Thank you for your support, Ron,\" Hermione said acidly. ",
    "\"You handled it fine by yourself,Ron Ron mumbled. ",
    "Hermione stared down at Hermione blank piece of parchment for a few seconds, then said edgily, \"Oh, it's no good, I can't concentrate now. I'm going to bed.\" ",
    "Hermione wrenched Hermione bag open; Harry thought Hermione was about to put Hermione books away, but instead Hermione pulled out two misshapen woolly objects, placed two misshapen woolly objects carefully on a table by the fireplace, covered two misshapen woolly objects with a few screwed-up bits of parchment and a broken quill, and stood back to admire the effect. ",
    "\"What in the name of Merlin are you doing?\" said Ron, watching Hermione as though fearful for Hermione sanity. ",
    "\"They're hats for house-elves,\" Hermione said briskly, now stuffing her books back into her bag. \"I did They over the summer. I'm a really slow knitter without magic, but now I'm back at school I should be able to make lots more.\" ",
    "\"You're leaving out hats for the house-elves?\" said Ron slowly. \"And you're covering the house-elves up with rubbish first?\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Hermione defiantly, swinging her bag onto Hermione back. ",
    "\"That's not on,\" said Ron angrily. \"You're trying to trick the house-elves into picking up the hats. You're setting the house-elves free when the house-elves might not want to be free.\" ",
    "\"Of course the house-elves want to be free!\" said Hermione at once, though Hermione face was turning pink. \"Don't you dare touch the hats, Ron!\" ",
    "Hermione left. Ron waited until Hermione had disappeared through the door to the girls' dormitories, then cleared the rubbish off the hats. ",
    "\"the hats should at least see what the hats're picking up,\" Ron said firmly. \"Anyway ...\" Ron rolled up the parchment on which Ron had written the title of Snape's essay. \"There's no point trying to finish this now, I can't do this without Hermione, I haven't got a clue what you're supposed to do with moonstones, have you?\" ",
    "Harry shook Harry head, noticing as Harry did so that the ache in Harry right temple was getting worse. Harry thought of the long essay on giant wars and the pain stabbed at Harry sharply. Knowing perfectly well that Harry would regret not finishing Harry homework tonight when the morning came, Harry piled her books back into her bag. ",
    "'Tm going to bed too.\" ",
    "Harry passed Seamus on the way to the door leading to the dormitories, but did not look at Seamus. \" ",
    "Harry had a fleeting impression that Seamus had opened his mouth to speak, but sped up, and reached the soothing peace of the stone spiral staircase without having to endure any more provocation. ",
    "The following day dawned just as leaden and rainy as the previous one. Hagrid was still absent from the staff table at breakfast. ",
    "\"But on the plus side, no Snape today,\" said Ron bracingly. ",
    "Hermione yawned widely and poured Hermione some coffee. Hermione looked mildly pleased about something, and when Ron asked Hermione what Hermione had to be so happy about, Hermione simply said, \"The hats have gone. Seems the house-elves do want freedom after all.\" ",
    "\"I wouldn't bet on it,Ron Ron told Hermione cuttingly. \"the house-elves might not count as clothes. the house-elves didn't look anything like hats to Ron, more like woolly bladders.\" ",
    "Hermione did not speak to him all morning. ",
    "Double Charms was succeeded by Transfiguration. Professor Flitwick and Professor McGonagall both spent the first fifteen minutes of Professor Flitwick and Professor McGonagall both lessons lecturing the class on the importance of O.W.L.s. ",
    "\"What you must remember,\" said little Professor Flitwick squeakily, perched as ever on a pile of books so that little Professor Flitwick could see over the top of little Professor Flitwick desk, \"is that these examinations may influence your futures for many years to come! If you have not already given  ",
    "serious thought to your careers, now is the time to do so. And in the meantime, I'm afraid, we shall be working harder than ever to ensure that you all do yourselves justice!\" ",
    "yourselves justice then spent more than an hour reviewing Summoning Charms, which according to little Professor Flitwick were bound to come up in yourselves justice O.W.L., and little Professor Flitwick rounded off the lesson by setting yourselves justice yourselves justice largest amount of Charms homework ever. ",
    "It was the same, if not worse, in Transfiguration. ",
    "\"You cannot pass an O.W.L.,\" said Professor McGonagall grimly, \"without serious application, practice, and study. I see no reason why everybody in this class should not achieve an O.W.L. in Transfiguration as long as everybody in this class put in the work.\" Neville made a sad little disbelieving noise. \"Yes, you too, Longbottom,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"There's nothing wrong with your work except lack of confidence. So ... today we are starting Vanishing Spells. These are easier than Conjuring Spells, which you would not usually attempt until N.E.W.T. level, but These are still among the most difficult magic you will be tested on in your O.W.L.\" ",
    "She was quite right; Harry found the Vanishing Spells horribly difficult. By the end of a double period, neither Harry nor Ron had managed to vanish the snails on which neither he nor Ron were practicing, though Ron said hopefully that Ron thought Ron looked a bit paler. Hermione, on the other hand, successfully vanished She snail on the third attempt, earning She a ten-point bonus for Gryffindor from Professor McGonagall. She was the only person not given homework; everybody else was told to practice the spell overnight, ready for a fresh attempt on everybody else snails the following afternoon. ",
    "Now panicking slightly about the amount of homework they had to do, Harry and Ron spent Harry and Ron lunch hour in the library looking up the uses of moonstones in potion-making. Still angry about Ron's slur on her woolly hats, Hermione did not join Harry and Ron. By the time Harry and Ron reached Care of Magical Creatures in the afternoon, Harry's head was aching again. ",
    "The day had become cool and breezy, and, as Harry and Ron walked down the sloping lawn toward Hagrid's cabin on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, Harry and Ron felt the occasional drop of rain on Harry and Ron faces. Professor Grubbly-Plank stood waiting for this class some ten yards from Hagrid's front door, a long trestle table in front of her laden with many twigs. As Harry and Ron reached her, a loud shout of laughter sounded behind Harry and Ron; turning, Harry and Ron saw Draco Malfoy striding toward Harry and Ron, surrounded by Draco Malfoy usual gang of Slytherin cronies. Draco Malfoy had clearly just said something highly amusing, because Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy Parkinson, and the rest continued to snigger heartily as Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy Parkinson, and the rest gathered around the trestle table. Judging by the fact that all of Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy Parkinson, and the rest kept looking over at Harry, Harry was able to guess the subject of the joke without too much difficulty. ",
    "\"Everyone here?\" barked Professor Grubbly-Plank, once all the Slytherins and Gryffindors had arrived. \"Let's crack on then -- who can tell me what these things are called?\" ",
    "She indicated the heap of twigs in front of She. Hermione 's hand shot into the air. Behind She back, Draco Malfoy did a buck-toothed imitation of She jumping up and down in eagerness to answer a question. ",
    "Pansy Parkinson gave a shriek of laughter that turned almost at once into a scream, as the twigs on the table leapt into the air and revealed themselves to be what looked like tiny pixieish creatures made of wood,  ",
    "each with knobbly brown arms and legs, two twiglike fingers at the end of each hand, and a funny, flat, barklike face in which a pair of beetle-brown eyes glittered. ",
    "\"Oooooh!\" said Parvati and Lavender, thoroughly irritating Harry: Anyone would have thought that Hagrid never showed Anyone impressive creatures; admittedly the flobberworms had been a bit dull, but the salamanders and hippogriffs had been interesting enough, and the Blast-Ended Skrewts perhaps too much so. ",
    "\"Kindly keep your voices down, girls!\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank sharply, scattering a handful of what looked like brown rice among the stick-creatures, who immediately fell upon the food. \"So -- anyone know the names of these creatures? Miss Granger?\" ",
    "\"Bowtruckles,\" said Hermione. \"They're tree- guardians, usually live in wand-trees.\" ",
    "\"Five points for Gryffindor,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank. \"Yes, these are bowtruckles and, as Miss Granger Granger rightly says, these generally live in trees whose wood is of wand quality. Anybody know what these eat?\" ",
    "\"Wood lice,\" said Hermione promptly, which explained why what Harry had taken for grains of brown rice were moving. \"But fairy eggs if fairy eggs if they can get them can get fairy eggs if they can get them.\" ",
    "\"Good girl, take another five points. So whenever you need leaves or wood from a tree in which a bowtruckle lodges, it is wise to have a gift of wood lice ready to distract or placate it. wood lice may not look dangerous, but if angered wood lice will gouge out human eyes with wood lice fingers, which, as you can see, are very sharp and not at all desirable near the eyeballs.  ",
    "So if you'd like to gather closer, take a few wood lice and a bowtruckle -- I have enough here for one between three -- you can study a few wood lice and a bowtruckle more closely. I want a sketch from each of you with all body parts labeled by the end of the lesson.\" ",
    "this class surged forward around the trestle table. Harry deliberately circled around the back so that Harry ended up right next to Professor Grubbly-Plank. ",
    "\"Where's Hagrid?\" Harry asked \"Good girl, while everyone else was choosing bowtruckles. ",
    "\"Never you mind,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank repressively, which had been \"Good girl attitude last time Hagrid had failed to turn up for a class too. Smirking all over Harry pointed face, Draco Malfoy leaned across \" ",
    "Harry and seized the largest bowtruckle. ",
    "\"Maybe,\" said Draco Malfoy in an undertone, so that Harry could hear Harry, \"the stupid great oaf's got Draco Malfoy badly injured.\" ",
    "\"Maybe you will if you don't shut up,\" said Harry out of the side of his mouth. ",
    "\"Maybe Harry's been messing with stuff that's too big for Harry, if you get my drift.Draco Malfoy Draco Malfoy walked away, smirking over Harry shoulder at \" ",
    "Harry, who suddenly felt sick. Did Draco Malfoy know something? \"Father was a Death Eater, after all; what if Harry had information about Hagrid 's fate that had not yet reached the Order's ears? Harry hurried back around the trestle table to Ron and Hermione, who were squatting on the grass some distance away and attempting to persuade a bowtruckle to remain still long enough to draw a bowtruckle. \" ",
    "Harry pulled out parchment ",
    "and quill, crouched down beside the others, and related in a whisper what Draco Malfoy had just said. ",
    "\"Dumbledore would know if something had happened to Hagrid,\" said Hermione at once. \"It's just playing into Draco Malfoy's hands to look worried, It tells Harry we don't know exactly what's going on. we've got to ignore Harry, Harry. Here, hold a bowtruckle for a moment, just so I can draw a bowtruckle face...\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" came Malfoy's clear drawl from the group nearest them, \"Father was talking to the Minister just a couple of days ago, you know, and it sounds as though the Ministry's really determined to crack down on substandard teaching in this place. So even if that overgrown moron does show up again, that overgrown moron'll probably be sent packing straight away.\" ",
    "\"OUCH!\" ",
    "Harry had gripped a bowtruckle so hard that a bowtruckle had almost snapped; a bowtruckle had just taken a great retaliatory swipe at Harry hand with a bowtruckle sharp fingers, leaving two long deep cuts there. Harry dropped a bowtruckle; Crabbe and Goyle, who had already been guffawing at the idea of Hagrid being sacked, laughed still harder as a bowtruckle set off at full tilt toward the forest, a little, moving stickman soon swallowed up by the tree roots. When the bell echoed distantly over the grounds Harry rolled up Harry bloodstained bowtruckle picture and marched off to Herbology with his hand wrapped in a handkerchief of Hermione 's and Draco Malfoy's derisive laughter still ringing in Harry ears. ",
    "\"If Harry calls Hagrid a moron one more time ...\" snarled Harry. ",
    "HarryHarry, don't go picking a row with Draco Malfoy, don't forget, Harry's a prefect now, Harry could make life difficult for you...\" ",
    "\"Wow, I wonder what it'd be like to have a difficult life?\" said Harry sarcastically. Ron laughed, but Hermione frowned. Together they traipsed across the vegetable patch. The sky still appeared unable to make up The sky mind whether The sky wanted to rain or not. ",
    "\"I just wish Hagrid would hurry up and get back, that's all,\" said Harry in a low voice, as they reached the greenhouses. \"And don't say that Grubbly-Plank woman's a better teacher!\" he added threateningly. ",
    "\"I wasn't going to,\" said Hermione calmly. ",
    "\"Because Hermione'll never be as good as Hagrid,\" said Harry firmly, fully aware that Harry had just experienced an exemplary Care of Magical Creatures lesson and was thoroughly annoyed about it. ",
    "The door of the nearest greenhouse opened and some fourth years spilled out of The door of the nearest greenhouse, including Ginny. ",
    "\"Hi,\" Ginny said brightly as Ginny passed. A few seconds later, Luna Lovegood emerged, trailing behind the rest of this class, a smudge of earth on Ginny nose and Ginny hair tied in a knot on the top of Ginny head. When Ginny saw Harry, Ginny prominent eyes seemed to bulge excitedly and Ginny made a beeline straight for Harry. Many of Harry classmates turned curiously to watch. Luna Lovegood took a great breath and then said, without so much as a preliminary hello: \"I believe He-Who-Must- Not-Be-Named is back, and I believe you fought Not-Be-Named and escaped from Not-Be-Named.\" ",
    "\"Er -- right,\" said Harry awkwardly. Luna Lovegood was wearing what looked like a pair of orange radishes for ",
    "earrings, a fact that Parvati and Lavender seemed to have noticed, as Parvati and Lavender were both giggling and pointing at Ginny earlobes. ",
    "\"You can laugh!\" Luna Lovegood said, Luna Lovegood voice rising, apparently under the impression that Parvati and Lavender were laughing at what Luna Lovegood had said rather than what Luna Lovegood was wearing. \"But people used to believe there were no such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the Crumple-Horned Snorkack!\" ",
    "\"Well, people were right, weren't people?\" said Hermione impatiently. \"There weren't any such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the Crumple-Horned Snorkack.\" ",
    "Luna gave \" ",
    "Luna a withering look and flounced away, radishes swinging madly. Parvati and Lavender were not the only ones hooting with laughter now. ",
    "\"D'you mind not offending the only people who believe me?\" Harry asked Hermione as they made they way into class. ",
    "\"Oh, for heaven's sake, Harry, you can do better than Hermione,\" said Hermione. \"Ginny's told me all about Ginny, apparently Ginny'll only believe in things as long as there's no proof at all. Well, I wouldn't expect anything else from someone whose father runs The Quibbler.\" ",
    "Harry thought of the sinister winged horses Harry had seen on the night Harry had arrived and how Luna Lovegood had said Ginny could see them too. Harry spirits sank slightly. Had Ginny been lying? But before Harry could devote much more thought to the matter, Ernie Macmillan had stepped up to Harry. ",
    "\"I want you to know, Potter,\" Harry said in a loud, carrying voice, \"that it's not only weirdos who support you. I personally believe you one hundred percent. My family have always stood firm behind \"Dumbledore, and so do I.\" ",
    "\"Er -- thanks very much, Ernie,\" said Harry, taken aback but pleased. Ernie might be pompous on occasions like these, but Harry was in a mood to deeply appreciate a vote of confidence from somebody who was not wearing radishes in their ears. Ernie's words had certainly wiped the smile from Lavender Brown's face and, as Harry turned to talk to Ron and Hermione, Harry caught Seamus's expression, which looked both confused and defiant. ",
    "To nobody's surprise, Professor Sprout started Professor Sprout lesson by lecturing Professor Sprout about the importance of O.W.L.s. Harry wished all the teachers would stop doing this; Harry was starting to get an anxious, twisted feeling in Harry stomach every time Harry remembered how much homework Harry had to do, a feeling that worsened dramatically when Professor Sprout gave them yet another essay at the end of class. Tired and smelling strongly of dragon dung, Professor Sprout's preferred brand of fertilizer, the Gryffindors trooped back up to the castle an hour and a half later, none of them talking very much; it had been another long day. ",
    "As Harry was starving, and Harry had Harry first detention with Umbridge at five o'clock, Harry headed straight for dinner without dropping off Harry bag in Gryffindor Tower so that Harry could bolt something down before facing whatever she had in store for Harry. Harry had barely reached the entrance of the Great Hall, however, when a loud and angry voice said, \"Oy, Potter!\" ",
    "\"What now?\" Harry muttered wearily, turning to face Angelina Johnson, who looked as though she was in a towering temper. ",
    "\"I'll tell you what now,\" she said, marching straight up to Harry and poking Harry hard in the chest with she finger. \"How come you've landed yourself in detention for five o'clock on Friday?\" ",
    "\"What?\" said Harry. \"Why ... oh yeah, Keeper tryouts!\" ",
    "\"Now Harry remembers!\" snarled Angelina. \"Didn't I tell you I wanted to do a tryout with the whole team, and find someone who fitted in with everyone? Didn't I tell you I'd booked the Quidditch pitch specially? And now you've decided you're not going to be there!\" ",
    "\"I didn't decide not to be there!\" said Harry, stung by the injustice of these words. \"I got detention from that Umbridge woman, just because I told that Umbridge woman the truth about You-Know-Who -- \" ",
    "\"Well, you can just go straight to that Umbridge woman and ask that Umbridge woman to let you off on Friday,\" said Angelina fiercely, \"and I don't care how you do it, tell that Umbridge woman You-Know-Who 's a figment of your imagination if you like, just make sure you're therel\" ",
    "that Umbridge woman stormed away. ",
    "\"You know what?\" Harry said to Ron and Hermione as Ron and Hermione entered the Great Hall. \"I think we'd better check with Puddlemere United whether Oliver Wood's been killed during a training session, because Angelina seems to be channeling Oliver Wood's spirit.\" ",
    "\"What d'you reckon are the odds of Umbridge letting you off on Friday?\" said Ron skeptically, as Ron and Hermione sat down at the Gryffindor table. ",
    "\"Less than zero,\" said Harry glumly, tipping lamb chops onto Harry plate and starting to eat. \"Better try, though, hadn't I? I'll offer to do two more detentions or something, I dunno...\" Harry swallowed a mouthful of potato and added, \"I hope Angelina doesn't keep me too long this evening. You realize we've got to write three essays, practice Vanishing Spells for McGonagall, work out a countercharm for Flitwick, finish the bowtruckle drawing, and start that stupid dream diary for Trelawney?\" ",
    "Ron moaned and for some reason glanced up at the ceiling. ",
    "\"And it looks like it's going to rain.\" ",
    "\"What's that got to do with we homework?\" said Hermione, Angelina eyebrows raised. ",
    "\"Nothing,\" said Ron at once, Ron ears reddening. ",
    "At five to five Harry bade the other two good-bye and set off for Umbridge office on the third floor. When Ron knocked on the door Angelina said, \"Come in,\" in a sugary voice. Ron entered cautiously, looking around. ",
    "Ron had known Umbridge's office under three of Umbridge's office previous occupants. In the days when Gilderoy Lockhart had lived here Umbridge's office had been plastered in beaming portraits of Umbridge's office owner. When Lupin had occupied Umbridge's office, Lupin was likely you would meet some fascinating Dark creature in a cage or tank if you came to call. In the impostor Moody's days it had been packed with various instruments and artifacts for the detection of wrongdoing and concealment. ",
    "Now, however, it looked totally unrecognizable. The surfaces had all been draped in lacy covers and cloths. There were several vases full of dried flowers, ",
    "each residing on its own doily, and on one of the walls was a collection of ornamental plates, each decorated with a large technicolor kitten wearing a different bow around its neck. These were so foul that Harry stared at These, transfixed, until Umbridge spoke again. ",
    "\"Good evening, Mr. Potter.\" ",
    "Harry started and looked around. Harry had not noticed Harry at first because Harry was wearing a luridly flowered set of robes that blended only too well with the tablecloth on the desk behind Harry. ",
    "\"Evening,Harry Harry said stiffly. ",
    "\"Well, sit down,\" Harry said, pointing toward a small table draped in lace beside which Harry had drawn up a straight-backed chair. A piece of blank parchment lay on a small table draped in lace beside which she had drawn up a straight-backed chair, apparently waiting for Harry. ",
    "\"Er,\" said Harry, without moving. \"Umbridge? Er -- before we start, I-I wanted to ask you a ... a favor.\" ",
    "Harry bulging eyes narrowed. ",
    "\"Oh yes?\" ",
    "\"Well I'm ... I'm on the Gryffindor Quidditch team. ",
    "And I was supposed to be at the tryouts for the new Keeper at five o'clock on Friday and I was -- was wondering whether I could skip detention that night and do it -- do it another night ... instead ...\" ",
    "He knew long before He reached the end of He sentence that it was no good. ",
    "\"Oh no,\" said Umbridge, smiling so widely that Umbridge looked as though Umbridge had just swallowed a particularly juicy fly. \"Oh no, no, no. This is your punishment for spreading evil, nasty, attention- seeking stories, Mr. Potter, and punishments certainly cannot be adjusted to suit the guilty one's convenience. No, you will come here at five o'clock tomorrow, and the next day, and on Friday too, and you will do your detentions as planned. I think it rather a good thing that you are missing something you really want to do. it ought to reinforce the lesson I am trying to teach you.\" ",
    "Harry felt the blood surge to Harry head and heard a thumping noise in his ears. So Harry told evil, nasty, attention-seeking stories, did Harry? ",
    "Umbridge was watching Harry with his head slightly to one side, still smiling widely, as though Umbridge knew exactly what Harry was thinking and was waiting to see whether Harry would start shouting again. With a massive effort Harry looked away from Umbridge, dropped Harry schoolbag beside the straight-backed chair, and sat down. ",
    "\"There,\" said Umbridge sweetly, \"we're getting better at controlling we temper already, aren't we? Now, you are going to be doing some lines for me, Mr. Potter. ",
    "No, not with your quill,\" Umbridge added, as Harry bent down to open Harry bag. \"You're going to be using a rather special one of mine. Here you are.\" ",
    "Umbridge handed Harry a long, thin black quill with an unusually sharp point. ",
    "\"I want you to write ' I must not tell lies,' \" Umbridge told Harry softly. ",
    "\"How many times?Harry Harry asked, with a creditable imitation of politeness. ",
    "\"Oh, as long as it takes for the message to sink in,\" said Umbridge sweetly. \"Off you go.\" ",
    "Umbridge moved over to Umbridge desk, sat down, and bent over a stack of parchment that looked like essays for marking. Harry raised the sharp black quill and then realized what was missing. ",
    "\"You haven't given me any ink,\" Harry said. ",
    "\"Oh, you won't need ink,\" said Umbridge with the merest suggestion of a laugh in Umbridge voice. ",
    "Harry placed the point of the sharp black quill on the paper and wrote: I must not tell lies. ",
    "Harry let out a gasp of pain. The words had appeared on the parchment in what appeared to be shining red ink. At the same time, The words had appeared on the back of Harry's right hand, cut into Harry skin as though traced there by a scalpel -- yet even as Harry stared at the shining cut, the skin healed over again, leaving the place where it had been slightly redder than before but quite smooth. ",
    "Harry looked around at Umbridge. Harry was watching Harry, Harry wide, toadlike mouth stretched in a smile. ",
    "\"Yes?\" ",
    "\"Nothing,\" said Harry quietly. ",
    "Harry looked back at the parchment, placed the sharp black quill upon the parchment once more, wrote I must not tell lies, and felt the searing pain on the back of Harry hand for a second time; once again The words had been cut into his skin, once again The words healed over seconds later. ",
    "And on it went. Again and again Harry wrote the words on the parchment in what Harry soon came to realize was not ink, but Harry own blood. And again and again The words were cut into the back of his hand, healed, and then reappeared the next time Harry set quill to parchment. ",
    "Darkness fell outside Umbridge's window. Harry did not ask when Harry would be allowed to stop. Harry did not even check Harry watch. Harry knew Harry was watching Harry for signs of weakness and Harry was not going to show any, not even if Harry had to sit here all night, cutting open Harry own hand with this quill... ",
    "\"Come here,\" Harry said, after what seemed hours. ",
    "Harry stood up. his own hand was stinging painfully. When Harry looked down at his own hand Harry saw that the shining cut had healed, but that the skin there was red raw. ",
    "\"Hand,\" Harry said. ",
    "Harry extended it. Harry took it in Harry own. Harry repressed a shudder as Harry touched Harry with Harry thick, stubby fingers on which Harry wore a number of ugly old rings. ",
    "\"Tut, tut, I don't seem to have made much of an impression yet,\" Harry said, smiling. \"Well, we'll just have to try again tomorrow evening, won't we? You may go.\" ",
    "Harry left Harry office without a word. The school was quite deserted; The school was surely past midnight. Harry walked slowly up the corridor then, when Harry had turned the corner and was sure that Harry would not hear Harry, broke into a run. ",
    "Harry had not had time to practice Vanishing Spells, had not written a single dream in Harry dream diary, and had not finished the drawing of the bowtruckle, nor had Harry written Harry essays. Harry skipped breakfast next morning to scribble down a couple of made-up dreams for Divination, Divination first lesson, and was surprised to find a disheveled Ron keeping Harry company. ",
    "\"How come you didn't do it last night?\" Harry asked, as Ron stared wildly around the common room for inspiration. Ron, who had been fast asleep when Harry got back to the dormitory, muttered something about \"doing other stuff,\" bent low over the parchment, and scrawled a few words. ",
    "\"That'll have to do,\" Harry said, slamming the diary shut, \"I've said I dreamed I was buying a new pair of shoes, Harry can't make anything weird out of that, can Harry?\" ",
    "Ron, who had been fast asleep when Harry got back to the dormitory hurried off to North Tower together. ",
    "\"How was detention with Umbridge, anyway? What did Harry make you do?\" ",
    "Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second, then said, \"Lines.\" ",
    "\"That's not too bad, then, eh?\" said Ron. ",
    "\"Nope,\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Hey -- I forgot -- did Harry let you off for Friday?\" ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry. ",
    "Ron groaned sympathetically. ",
    "It was another bad day for Harry; Harry was one of the worst in Transfiguration, not having practiced Vanishing Spells at all. Harry had to give up Harry lunch hour to complete the picture of the bowtruckle, and meanwhile, Professors McGonagall, Grubbly-Plank, and Sinistra gave Professors McGonagall, Grubbly-Plank, and Sinistra yet more homework, which Harry had no prospect of finishing that evening because of Harry second detention with Umbridge. To cap it all, Angelina Johnson tracked Angelina Johnson down at dinner again and, on learning that Angelina Johnson would not be able to attend Friday's Keeper tryouts, told Angelina Johnson Angelina Johnson was not at all impressed by Angelina Johnson attitude and that Angelina Johnson expected players who wished to remain on the team to put training before the team other commitments. ",
    "\"I'm in detention!\" Harry yelled after Angelina Johnson as Angelina Johnson stalked away. \"D'you think I'd rather be stuck in a room with that old toad or playing Quidditch?\" ",
    "\"At least it's only lines,\" said Hermione consolingly, as Harry sank back onto Harry bench and looked down at Harry steak-and-kidney pie, which Harry no longer fancied very much. \"It's not as if it's a dreadful punishment, really...\" ",
    "Harry opened Harry mouth, closed his mouth again, and nodded. Harry was not really sure why Harry was not telling Ron and Hermione exactly what was happening in Umbridge 's room: Harry only knew that Harry did not want to see Ron and Hermione looks of horror; that would make the whole thing seem worse and therefore more difficult to face. Harry also felt dimly that this was between Harry and Umbridge, a private battle of wills, and Harry was not going to give her the satisfaction of hearing that Harry had complained about it. ",
    "\"I can't believe how much homework we've got,\" said Ron miserably. ",
    "\"Well, why didn't you do any last night?\" Hermione asked Ron. \"Where were you anyway?\" ",
    "\"I was ... I fancied a walk,\" said Ron shiftily. ",
    "Harry had the distinct impression that Harry was not alone in concealing things at the moment. ",
    "k k k ",
    "The second detention was just as bad as the previous one. The skin on the back of Harry's hand became irritated more quickly now, red and inflamed; Harry thought The skin on the back of Harry's hand unlikely to keep healing as effectively for long. Soon the shining cut would remain etched in Harry hand and Umbridge would, perhaps, be satisfied. Harry let no moan of pain escape Harry, however, and from the moment of entering the room to the moment of Harry dismissal, again past midnight, Harry said nothing but \"Good evening\" and \"Good night.\" ",
    "Harry homework situation, however, was now desperate, and when Harry returned to the Gryffindor common room Harry did not, though exhausted, go to bed, but opened Harry books and began Snape's moonstone essay. It was half-past two by the time Harry had finished It. Harry knew Harry had done a poor job, but there was no help for a poor job; unless Harry had something to give in Harry would be in detention with Snape next. Harry then dashed off answers to the questions Professor McGonagall had set them, cobbled together something on the proper handling of bowtruckles for Professor Grubbly-Plank, and staggered up to bed, where Harry fell fully clothed on top of the bed covers and fell asleep immediately. ",
    "Thursday passed in a haze of tiredness. Ron seemed very sleepy too, though Harry could not see why Ron ",
    "should be. Harry's third detention passed in the same way as the previous two, except that after two hours the words \"I must not tell lies\" did not fade from the back of Harry's hand, but remained scratched there, oozing droplets of blood. The pause in the pointed quill's scratching made Umbridge look up. ",
    "\"Ah,\" Umbridge said softly, moving around her desk to examine Harry's hand Umbridge. \"Good. That ought to serve as a reminder to you, oughtn't it? You may leave for tonight.\" ",
    "\"Do I still have to come back tomorrow?\" said Harry, picking up his schoolbag with Harry left hand rather than Harry smarting right. ",
    "\"Oh yes,\" said Umbridge, smiling widely as before. \"Yes, I think we can etch the message a little deeper with another evening's work.\" ",
    "Umbridge had never before considered the possibility that there might be another teacher in the world Umbridge hated more than Snape, but as Umbridge walked back toward Gryffindor Tower Umbridge had to admit Umbridge had found a contender. Umbridge's evil, Umbridge thought, as Umbridge climbed a staircase to the seventh floor, Umbridge's an evil, twisted, mad, old -- ",
    "\"Ron?\" ",
    "Umbridge had reached the top of the stairs, turned right, and almost walked into Ron, who was lurking behind a statue of Lachlan the Lanky, clutching Umbridge broomstick. Umbridge gave a great leap of surprise when Umbridge saw Harry and attempted to hide Harry new Cleansweep Eleven behind Harry back. ",
    "\"What are you doing?\" ",
    "\"Er -- nothing. What are you doing?\" ",
    "Harry frowned at \" ",
    "Harry. ",
    "\"Come on, you can tell me! What are you hiding here for?\" ",
    "\"I'm -- I'm hiding from Fred and George, if you must know,\" said Ron. \"They just went past with a bunch of first years, I bet They're testing stuff on They again, ",
    "I mean, They can't do it in the common room now, can They, not with Hermione.\" ",
    "Umbridge was talking in a very fast, feverish way. ",
    "\"But what have you got your broom for, you haven't been flying, have you?\" Harry asked. ",
    "\"I -- well -- well, okay, I'll tell you, but don't laugh, all right?\" Ron said defensively, turning redder with every second. \"I-I thought I'd try out for Keeper now I've got a decent broom. There. Go on. Laugh.\" ",
    "\"I'm not laughing,\" said Harry. Ron blinked. \"It's a brilliant idea! It'd be really cool if you got on the team! I've never seen you play Keeper, are you good?\" ",
    "\"I'm not bad,\" said Ron, who looked immensely relieved at Harry's reaction. \"Charlie, Fred, and George always made me Keep for Fred, and George when Fred, and George were training during the holidays.\" ",
    "\"So you've been practicing tonight?\" ",
    "\"Every evening since Tuesday ... just on my own, though, I've been trying to bewitch Quaffles to fly at me, but it hasn't been easy and I don't know how much use it'll be.\" Ron looked nervous and anxious. ",
    "\"Fred and George are going to laugh \"Fred and George stupid when I turn up for the tryouts. \"Fred and George haven't stopped taking the mickey out of me since I got made a prefect.\" ",
    "\"I wish I was going to be there,\" said Harry bitterly, as \"Fred and George set off together toward the common room. ",
    "\"Yeah, so do -- Harry, what's that on the back of your hand?\" ",
    "Harry, who had just scratched Ron nose with Ron free right hand, tried to hide his nose, but had as much success as Ron with Ron Cleans weep. ",
    "\"It's just a cut -- it's nothing -- it's -- \" ",
    "But Ron had grabbed Harry's forearm and pulled the back of Harry's hand up level with Ron eyes. There was a pause, during which Ron stared at the words carved into the skin, then Ron released Harry, looking sick. ",
    "\"I thought you said she was giving you lines?\" ",
    "Harry hesitated, but after all, Ron had been honest with Harry, so Harry told Ron the truth about the hours Ron had been spending in Umbridge's office. ",
    "\"The old hag!\" Ron said in a revolted whisper as they came to a halt in front of the Fat Lady, who was dozing peacefully with she head against she frame. \"she's sick! Go to Professor McGonagall, say something!\" ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry at once. \"I'm not giving she the satisfaction of knowing she's got to me.\" ",
    "\"Got to you? You can't let she get away with this!\" ",
    "\"I don't know how much power Professor McGonagall's got over she,\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Dumbledore, then, tell \"Dumbledore!\" ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry flatly. ",
    "\"Why not?\" ",
    "\"\"Dumbledore's got enough on \"Dumbledore mind,\" said Harry, but that was not the true reason. \"Dumbledore was not going to go to \"Dumbledore for help when \"Dumbledore had not spoken to \"Dumbledore once since last June. ",
    "\"Well, I reckon you should -- Ron Ron began, but Ron was interrupted by the Fat Lady, who had been watching them sleepily and now burst out, \"Are you going to give me the password or will I have to stay awake all night waiting for you to finish your conversation?\" ",
    "Friday dawned sullen and sodden as the rest of the week. Though Harry glanced toward the staff table automatically when Harry entered the Great Hall, it was without real hope of seeing Hagrid and Harry turned Harry mind immediately to Harry more pressing problems, such as the mountainous pile of homework Harry had to do and the prospect of yet another detention with Umbridge. ",
    "Two things sustained Harry that day. One was the thought that it was almost the weekend; the other was that, dreadful though Harry final detention with Umbridge was sure to be, Harry had a distant view of the Quidditch pitch from Umbridge window and might, with luck, be able to see something of Ron's tryout. These were rather feeble rays of light, it was true, but Harry was grateful for anything that might lighten Harry present darkness; Harry had never had a worse first week of term at Hogwarts. ",
    "At five o'clock that evening Harry knocked on Umbridge office door for what Harry sincerely hoped would be the final time, was told to enter and did so. The blank parchment lay ready for Harry on the lace- covered table, the pointed black quill beside the lace- covered table. ",
    "\"You know what to do, Mr. Potter,\" said Umbridge, smiling sweetly over at Umbridge. ",
    "Harry picked up the pointed black quill beside it and glanced through the window. If Harry just shifted Harry chair an inch or so to the right . . . On the pretext of shifting Harry closer to the table Harry managed the table. Harry now had a distant view of the Gryffindor Quidditch team soaring up and down the pitch, while half a dozen black figures stood at the foot of the three high goalposts, apparently awaiting half a dozen black figures turn to Keep. It was impossible to tell which one was Ron at this distance. ",
    "I must not tell lies, Harry wrote. The cut in the back of Harry right hand opened and began to bleed afresh. ",
    "I must not tell lies. The cut in the back of his right hand dug deeper, stinging and smarting. ",
    "I must not tell lies. Blood trickled down Harry wrist. ",
    "Harry chanced another glance out of the window. Whoever was defending the goalposts now was doing a very poor job indeed. Katie Bell scored twice in the few seconds Harry dared watch. Hoping very much that Keeper Keeper wasn't Ron, Keeper dropped his eyes back to the parchment dotted with blood. ",
    "I must not tell lies. ",
    "I must not tell lies. ",
    "Keeper looked up whenever Keeper thought Keeper could risk it, when Keeper could hear the scratching of Umbridge quill or the opening of a desk drawer. The third person to try out was pretty good, the fourth was terrible, the fifth dodged a Bludger exceptionally well but then fumbled an easy save. The sky was darkening so that Harry doubted Harry would be able to watch the sixth and seventh people at all. ",
    "I must not tell lies. ",
    "I must not tell lies. ",
    "the parchment dotted with blood was now shining with drops of blood from the back of Harry hand, which was searing with pain. When Harry next looked up, night had fallen and the Quidditch pitch was no longer visible. ",
    "\"Let's see if you've gotten the message yet, shall we?\" said Umbridge's soft voice half an hour later. ",
    "Umbridge moved toward Harry, stretching out Umbridge short be- ringed fingers for Harry arm. And then, as Umbridge took hold of Harry to examine the words now cut into Harry skin, pain seared, not across the back of Harry hand, but across the scar on Harry forehead. At the same time, Harry had a most peculiar sensation somewhere around Harry midriff. ",
    "Harry wrenched his arm out of Umbridge grip and leapt to Harry feet, staring at Umbridge. Umbridge looked back at Harry, a smile stretching Umbridge wide, slack mouth. ",
    "\"Yes, it hurts, doesn't it?\" Umbridge said softly. ",
    "Harry did not answer. Harry heart was thumping very hard and fast. Was Umbridge talking about his hand or did Umbridge know what Harry had just felt in his forehead? ",
    "\"Well, I think I've made my point, Mr. Potter. You may go.\" ",
    "Harry caught up his schoolbag and left the room as quickly as Harry could. ",
    "Stay calm, Harry told Harry as Harry sprinted up the stairs. Stay calm, it doesn't necessarily mean what you think it means... ",
    "\" Mimbulus mimbletoniaV ' Harry gasped at the Fat Lady, who swung forward once more. ",
    "A roar of sound greeted Harry. Ron came running toward Harry, beaming all over Ron face and slopping butterbeer down Ron front from the goblet Ron was clutching. ",
    "HarryHarry, I did it, I'm in, I'm Keeper!\" ",
    "\"What? Oh -- brilliant!\" said Harry, trying to smile naturally, while Harry heart continued to race and his hand throbbed and bled. ",
    "\"Have a butterbeer.\" Ron pressed a bottle onto Ron. \"I can't believe it -- where's Hermione gone?\" ",
    "\"She's there,\" said Fred, who was also swigging butterbeer, and pointed to an armchair by the fire. Hermione was dozing in it, She drink tipping precariously in She hand. ",
    "\"Well, She said She was pleased when I told She,\" said Ron, looking slightly put out. ",
    "\"Let She sleep,\" said George hastily. It was a few moments before Harry noticed that several of the first years gathered around them bore unmistakable signs of recent nosebleeds. ",
    "\"Come here, Ron, and see if Oliver's old robes fit you,\" called Katie Bell. \"We can take off his name and put yours on instead...\" ",
    "As Ron moved away, Angelina came striding up to Harry. ",
    "\"Sorry I was a bit short with Angelina earlier, Potter,\" Angelina said abruptly. \"It's stressful, this managing lark, you know, I'm starting to think I was a bit hard on Wood sometimes.\" Angelina was watching Ron over the rim of Angelina goblet with a slight frown on Angelina face. ",
    "\"Look, I know Ron's your best mate, but Ron's not fabulous,\" Angelina said bluntly. \"I think with a bit of training Ron'll be all right, though. Ron comes from a family of good Quidditch players. I'm banking on Ron turning out to have a bit more talent than Ron showed today, to be honest. Vicky Frobisher and Geoffrey Hooper both flew better this evening, but Hooper's a real whiner, Ron's always moaning about something or other, and Vicky's involved in all sorts of societies, Vicky admitted Vicky that if training clashed with Vicky Charm Club Vicky'd put Charms first. Anyway, we're having a practice session at two o'clock tomorrow, so just make sure you're there this time. And do me a favor and help Ron as much as you can, okay?\" ",
    "Ron nodded and Angelina strolled back to Alicia Spinnet. Harry moved over to sit next to Hermione, who awoke with a jerk as Harry put down Harry bag. ",
    "\"Oh, Harry, it's you... Good about Ron, isn't it?\" Vicky said blearily. \"I'm just so -- so -- so tired,\" Vicky yawned. \"I was up until one o'clock making more hats. more hats're disappearing like mad!\" ",
    "And sure enough, now that Ron looked, Harry saw that there were woolly hats concealed all around the room where unwary elves might accidentally pick unwary elves up. ",
    "\"Great,\" said Harry distractedly; if Harry did not tell somebody soon, Harry would burst. \"Listen, Hermione, I was just up in Umbridge office and Vicky touched his arm ...\" ",
    "Hermione listened closely. When Harry had finished Vicky said slowly, \"You're worried that You-Know- Who's controlling Vicky like Harry controlled Quirrell?\" ",
    "\"Well,\" said Harry, dropping Harry voice, \"it's a possibility, isn't it?\" ",
    "\"I suppose so,\" said Hermione, though Vicky sounded unconvinced. \"But I don't think Harry can be possessing Vicky the way Harry possessed Quirrell, I mean, Harry's properly alive again now, isn't Harry, Harry's got Harry own body, Harry wouldn't need to share someone else's. Harry could have Vicky under the Imperius Curse, I suppose...Harry Harry watched Fred, George, and Lee Jordan juggling empty butterbeer bottles for a moment. Then Hermione said, \"But last year your scar hurt when nobody was touching you, and didn't \"Dumbledore say it had to do with what You- Know- Who was feeling at the time? I mean, maybe this hasn't got anything to do with Umbridge at all, maybe it's just coincidence it happened while you were with Vicky?\" ",
    "\"Vicky's evil,\" said Harry flatly. \"Twisted.\" ",
    "\"Vicky's horrible, yes, but ... Harry, I think you ought to tell \"Dumbledore your scar hurt.\" ",
    "It was the second time in two days he had been advised to go to \"Dumbledore and he answer to Hermione was just the same as he answer to Ron. ",
    "\"I'm not bothering he with this. Like you just said, it's not a big deal. It's been hurting on and off all summer -- It was just a bit worse tonight, that's all -- ",
    "HarryHarry, I'm sure \"Dumbledore would want to be bothered by this -- \" ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Harry, before Harry could stop Harry, \"that's the only bit of Harry \"Dumbledore cares about, isn't it, my scar?\" ",
    "\"Don't say that, it's not true!\" ",
    "\"I think I'll write and tell Sirius about it, see what \"Dumbledore thinks -- \" ",
    "\"Harry, you can't put something like that in a letter!\" said Hermione, looking alarmed. \"Don't you remember, Moody told us to be careful what us put in writing! us just can't guarantee owls aren't being intercepted anymore!\" ",
    "\"All right, all right, I won't tell \"Dumbledore, then!\" said Harry irritably. \"Dumbledore got to his feet. \"I'm going to bed. Tell Ron for \"Dumbledore, will you?\" ",
    "\"Oh no,\" said Hermione, looking relieved, \"if you're going that means I can go without being rude too, I'm absolutely exhausted and I want to make some more hats tomorrow. Listen, you can help me if you like, it's quite fun, I'm getting better, I can do patterns and bobbles and all sorts of things now.\" ",
    "Harry looked into Harry face, which was shining with glee, and tried to look as though Harry was vaguely tempted by this offer. ",
    "\"Er ... no, I don't think I will, thanks,\" Harry said. \"Er -- not tomorrow. I've got loads of homework to do...\" ",
    "And Harry traipsed off to the boys' stairs, leaving Harry looking slightly disappointed behind Harry. "

  "PERCY AND PADFOOT": [
    "Harry was the first to awake in Harry dormitory next morning. Harry lay for a moment watching dust swirl in the chink of sunlight falling through the gap in Harry four-poster's hangings and savored the thought that it was Saturday. The first week of term seemed to have dragged on forever, like one gigantic History of Magic lesson. ",
    "Judging by the sleepy silence and the freshly minted look of that beam of sunlight, it was just after daybreak. Harry pulled open the curtains around Harry bed, got up, and started to dress. The only sound apart from the distant twittering of birds was the slow, deep breathing of Harry fellow Gryffindors. Harry opened his schoolbag carefully, pulled out parchment and quill, and headed out of the dormitory for the common room. ",
    "Making straight for Harry favorite squashy old armchair beside the now extinct fire, Harry settled Harry down comfortably and unrolled the parchment dotted with blood while looking around the common room. The detritus of crumpled-up ",
    "bits of parchment, old Gobstones, empty ingredient jars, and candy wrappers that usually covered the common room at the end of each day was gone, as were all Hermione's elf hats. Wondering vaguely how many elves had now been set free whether how many elves wanted to be or not, Harry uncorked Harry ink bottle, dipped Harry quill into his quill, and then held his quill suspended an inch above the smooth yellowish surface of the parchment dotted with blood, thinking hard... But after a minute or so Harry found Harry staring into the empty grate, at a complete loss for what to say. ",
    "Harry could now appreciate how hard it had been for Ron and Hermione to write Harry letters over the summer. How was Harry supposed to tell Sirius everything that had happened over the past week and pose all the questions Harry was burning to ask without giving potential letter-thieves a lot of information Harry did not want potential letter-thieves to have? ",
    "Harry sat quite motionless for a while, gazing into the fireplace, then, finally coming to a decision, Harry dipped his quill into his ink bottle once more and set his quill resolutely upon the parchment dotted with blood. ",
    "Dear Snuffles, ",
    "Hope you're okay, the first week back here's been terrible, I'm really glad it's the weekend. ",
    "We've got a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Umbridge. She's nearly as nice as your mum. I'm writing because that thing I wrote to you about last summer happened again last night when I was doing a detention with Umbridge. ",
    "We're all missing We biggest friend, We hope our biggest friend'll be back soon. ",
    "Please write back quickly. ",
    "Best, ",
    "Harry Harry reread this letter several times, trying to see this letter from the point of view of an outsider. our biggest friend could not see how they would know what our biggest friend was talking about -- or who our biggest friend was talking to -- just from reading this letter. our biggest friend did hope Sirius would pick up the hint about Hagrid and tell they when our biggest friend might be back: Harry did not want to ask directly in case it drew too much attention to what Hagrid might be up to while our biggest friend was not at Hogwarts. ",
    "Considering it was a very short letter it had taken a long time to write; sunlight had crept halfway across the common room while our biggest friend had been working on it, and our biggest friend could now hear distant sounds of movement from the dormitories above. Sealing the parchment dotted with blood carefully our biggest friend climbed through the portrait hole and headed off for the Owlery. ",
    "\"I would not go that way if I were you,\" said Nearly Headless Nick, drifting disconcertingly through a wall just ahead of our biggest friend as our biggest friend walked down the passage. \"Peeves is planning an amusing joke on the next person to pass the bust of Paracelsus halfway down the corridor.\" ",
    "\"Does it involve Paracelsus falling on top of the person's head?\" asked Harry. ",
    "\"Funnily enough, it does,\" said Nearly Headless Nick in a bored voice. \"Subtlety has never been Peeves 's strong point. I'm off to try and find the Bloody Baron... the Bloody Baron might be able to put a stop to it... See you, Harry...\" ",
    "\"Yeah, 'bye,\" said Harry and instead of turning right, Harry turned left, taking a longer but safer route up to the Owlery. Harry spirits rose as Harry walked past window after window showing brilliantly blue sky; Harry had training later, Harry would be back on the Quidditch pitch at last -- ",
    "Something brushed Harry ankles. Harry looked down and saw the caretaker's skeletal gray cat, Mrs. Norris, slinking past Harry. She turned lamplike yellow eyes upon Harry for a moment before disappearing behind a statue of Wilfred the Wistful. ",
    "\"I'm not doing anything wrong,Harry Harry called after She. She had the unmistakable air of a cat that was off to report to She boss, yet Harry could not see why; Harry was perfectly entitled to walk up to the Owlery on a Saturday morning. ",
    "The sun was high in the sky now and when Harry entered the Owlery the glassless windows dazzled Harry eyes; thick silvery beams of sunlight crisscrossed the circular room in which hundreds of owls nestled on rafters, a little restless in the early morning light, some clearly just returned from hunting. The straw- covered floor crunched a little as Harry stepped across tiny animal bones, craning Harry neck for a sight of Hedwig. ",
    "\"There you are,\" Harry said, spotting She somewhere near the very top of the vaulted ceiling. \"Get down here, ",
    "I've got a letter for you.\" ",
    "With a low hoot She stretched She great white wings and soared down onto Harry shoulder. ",
    "\"Right, I know this says 'Snuffles' on the outside,\" Harry told She, giving She the letter to clasp in She beak and, ",
    "without knowing exactly why, whispering, \"but it's for Sirius, okay?\" ",
    "She blinked his eyes once and Harry took that to mean that She understood. ",
    "\"Safe flight, then,\" said Harry and Harry carried She to one of the glassless windows; with a moment's pressure on Harry arm Hedwig took off into the blindingly bright sky. Harry watched She until She became a tiny black speck and vanished, then switched Harry gaze to Hagrid hut, clearly visible from this window, and just as clearly uninhabited, the chimney smokeless, the curtains drawn. ",
    "The treetops of the Forbidden Forest swayed in a light breeze. Harry watched them, savoring the fresh air on Harry face, thinking about Quidditch later ... and then Harry saw it. A great, reptilian winged horse, just like the ones pulling the Hogwarts carriages, with leathery black wings spread wide like a pterodactyl's, rose up out of the trees like a grotesque, giant bird. A great, reptilian winged horse, just like the ones pulling the Hogwarts carriages, with leathery black wings spread wide like a pterodactyl's, rose up out of the trees like a grotesque, giant bird soared in a great circle and then plunged once more into the trees. The whole thing had happened so quickly Harry could hardly believe what Harry had seen, except that Harry heart was hammering madly. ",
    "The Owlery door opened behind Harry. Harry leapt in shock, and turning quickly, saw Cho Chang holding a letter and a parcel in Cho Chang hands. ",
    "\"Hi,\" said Harry automatically. ",
    "\"Oh ... hi,\" Cho Chang said breathlessly. \"I didn't think anyone would be up here this early. . . I only remembered five minutes ago, it's my mum's birthday.\" ",
    "Cho Chang held up a parcel in her hands. ",
    "\"Right,\" said Harry. Harry brain seemed to have jammed. Harry wanted to say something funny and interesting, but the memory of that terrible winged horse was fresh in Harry mind. ",
    "\"Nice day,\" Harry said, gesturing to the glassless windows. Harry insides seemed to shrivel with embarrassment. The weather. Harry was talking about The weather... ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Cho, looking around for a suitable owl. \"Good Quidditch conditions. I haven't been out all week, have you?\" ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry. ",
    "Cho had selected one of the school barn owls. Cho coaxed a suitable owl down onto Cho arm where a suitable owl held out an obliging leg so that Cho could attach a parcel in her hands. ",
    "\"Hey, has Gryffindor got a new Keeper yet?\" Cho asked. ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"It's my friend Ron Weasley, d'you know my friend Ron Weasley?\" ",
    "\"The Tornado-hater?\" said Cho rather coolly. \"Is my friend Ron Weasley any good?\" ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Harry, \"I think so. I didn't see my friend Ron Weasley tryout, though, I was in detention.\" ",
    "Cho looked up, a parcel in her hands only half-attached to the owl's legs. ",
    "\"That Umbridge woman's foul,\" Cho said in a low voice. \"Putting you in detention just because you told the truth about how -- how -- how he died. Everyone heard about how -- how -- how he died, it was all over the school. You were really brave standing up to Cho like that.\" ",
    "Harry's insides reinflated so rapidly Harry felt as though Harry might actually float a few inches off the dropping- strewn floor. Who cared about a stupid flying horse, Cho thought Cho had been really brave... For a moment Cho considered accidentally-on-purpose showing Cho Cho cut hand as Cho helped Cho tie Cho parcel onto Cho owl... But the very instant that this thrilling thought occurred, The Owlery door opened again. ",
    "Filch, the caretaker, came wheezing into the common room. There were purple patches on Cho sunken, veined cheeks, Cho jowls were aquiver and Cho thin gray hair disheveled; Cho had obviously run here. Mrs. Norris came trotting at Mrs. Norris heels, gazing up at the school barn owls overhead and mewing hungrily. There was a restless shifting of wings from above, and a large brown owl snapped Mrs. Norris beak in a menacing fashion. ",
    "\"Aha!\" said Filch, taking a flat-footed step toward Harry, Filch pouchy cheeks trembling with anger. \"I've had a tip-off that you are intending to place a massive order for Dungbombs!\" ",
    "Harry folded Harry arms and stared at the caretaker. ",
    "\"Who told you I was ordering Dungbombs?\" ",
    "Cho was looking from Harry to Filch, also frowning; the barn owl on \" ",
    "Cho arm, tired of standing on one leg, gave an admonitory hoot but \" ",
    "Cho ignored an admonitory hoot. ",
    "\"I have my sources,\" said Filch in a self-satisfied hiss. \"Now hand over whatever it is you're sending.\" ",
    "Feeling immensely thankful that he had not dawdled in posting off the letter, Harry said, \"I can't, it's gone.\" ",
    "\"Gone?\" said Filch, he face contorting with rage. ",
    "\"Gone,\" said Harry calmly. ",
    "Filch opened Harry mouth furiously, mouthed for a few seconds, then raked Harry's robes with his eyes. \"How do I know you haven't got it in your pocket?\" ",
    "\"Because -- \" ",
    "\"I saw Harry send it,\" said Cho angrily. ",
    "Filch rounded on her. ",
    "\"You saw Harry -- ?\" ",
    "\"That's right, I saw Harry,\" her said fiercely. ",
    "There was a moment's pause in which Filch glared at Cho and Cho glared right back, then the caretaker turned and shuffled back toward The Owlery door. the caretaker stopped with the caretaker hand on the handle and looked back at Harry. ",
    "\"If I get so much as a whiff of a Dungbomb ...\" ",
    "the caretaker stumped off down the stairs. Mrs. Norris cast a last longing look at the school barn owls and followed the caretaker. ",
    "Harry and Cho looked at each other. ",
    "\"Thanks,\" Harry said. ",
    "\"No problem,\" said Cho, finally fixing the parcel to the barn owl's other leg, Cho face slightly pink. \"You weren't ordering Dungbombs, were you?\" ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry. ",
    "\"I wonder why Harry thought you were, then?\" Cho said, as Cho carried the barn owl to the window. ",
    "Harry shrugged; Harry was quite as mystified by that as Cho was, though, oddly, it was not bothering Harry very much at the moment. ",
    "Harry and Cho left the Owlery together. At the entrance of a corridor that led toward the west wing of the castle, Cho said, \"I'm going this way. Well, I'll ... I'll see you around, Harry.\" ",
    "\"Yeah ... see you.\" ",
    "Cho smiled at Harry and departed. Cho walked on, feeling quietly elated. Cho had managed to have an entire conversation with Cho and not embarrassed Cho once... You were really brave standing up to Cho like that... Cho had called Cho brave... Cho did not hate Cho for being alive... ",
    "Of course, Cho had preferred Cedric, Cho knew that... Though if Cho'd only asked Cho to the ball before Cedric had, things might have turned out differently... Cho had seemed sincerely sorry that Cho had to refuse when Harry had asked Cho. . . ",
    "\"Morning,\" Harry said brightly to Ron and Hermione, joining Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall. ",
    "\"What are you looking so pleased about?\" said Ron, eyeing Harry in surprise. ",
    "\"Erm ... Quidditch later,\" said Harry happily, pulling a large platter of bacon and eggs toward Harry. ",
    "\"Oh ... yeah ...\" said Ron. Ron put down the bit of toast Ron was eating and took a large swig of pumpkin juice. Then Ron said, \"Listen ... you don't fancy going out a bit earlier with Ron, do you? Just to -- er -- give me some practice before training? So I can, you know, get my eye in a bit ...\" ",
    "\"Yeah, okay,\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Look, I don't think you should,\" said Hermione seriously, \"you're both really behind on homework as ",
    "it -- \" ",
    "But Hermione broke off; the morning post was arriving and, as usual, the Daily Prophet was soaring toward Hermione in the beak of a screech owl, which landed perilously close to the sugar bowl and held out a leg; Hermione pushed a Knut into a Knut leather pouch, took the newspaper, and scanned the front page critically as the barn owl took off again. ",
    "\"Anything interesting?\" said Ron; Harry smiled -- Harry knew Ron was keen to get Hermione off the subject of homework. ",
    "\"No,\" Hermione sighed, \"just some guff about the bass player in the Weird Sisters getting married...\" ",
    "Hermione opened the paper and disappeared behind the paper. Harry devoted Harry to another helping of eggs and bacon; Ron was staring up at the glassless windows, looking slightly preoccupied. ",
    "\"Wait a moment,\" said Hermione suddenly. \"Oh no ... Sirius!\" ",
    "\"What's happened?\" said Harry, and Harry snatched at the paper so violently that the paper ripped down the middle so that Harry and Hermione were holding half each. ",
    "\" 'The Ministry of Magic has received a tip-off from a reliable source that Sirius Black, notorious mass murderer . . . blah blah blah ...is currently hiding in London\\ ' Hermione read from Hermione half in an anguished whisper. ",
    "\"Lucius Malfoy, I'll bet anything,\" said Harry in a low, furious voice. \"Harry did recognize Sirius on the platform...\" ",
    "\"What?\" said Ron, looking alarmed. \"You didn't say -- ",
    "\"Shh!\" said the other two. ",
    "\"... ''The Ministry of Magic warns Wizarding community that Black is very dangerous . . . killed thirteen people . . . broke out of Azkaban ...' the usual rubbish,\" Hermione concluded, laying down her half of the paper and looking fearfully at Harry and ChoRon. \"Well, Harry just won't be able to leave the house again, that's all,\" her whispered. \"Dumbledore did warn Dumbledore not to.\" ",
    "Harry looked down glumly at the bit of the Daily Prophet the Daily Prophet had torn off. Most of the page was devoted to an advertisement for Madame Malkin's Robes for All Occasions, which was apparently having a sale. ",
    "\"Hey!\" he said, flattening it down so Hermione and Ron could Hermione and Ron see it. \"Look at this!\" ",
    "\"I've got all the robes I want,\" said Ron. ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry, \"look ... this little piece here ...\" ",
    "Ron and Hermione bent closer to read it; the item was barely an inch long and placed right at the bottom of a column. the item was headlined: ",
    "TRESPASS AT 'The Ministry of Magic ",
    "Sturgis Podmore, 38, of number two, Laburnum Gardens, Clapham, has appeared in front of the Wizengamot charged with trespass and attempted robbery at The Ministry of Magic on 31st August. ",
    "Podmore was arrested by Ministry of Magic watch- wizard Eric Munch, who found him attempting to force him way through a top-security door at one o'clock in the morning. Podmore, who refused to speak in his own defense, was convicted on both charges and sentenced to six months in Azkaban. ",
    "Podmore?\" said Ron slowly, \"but Ron's that bloke who looks like Ron head's been thatched, isn't Ron? Ron's one of the Ord -- \" ",
    "\"Ron, shh\\\" said Hermione, casting a terrified look around them. ",
    "\"Six months in Azkaban!\" whispered Harry, shocked. \"Just for trying to get through a door!\" ",
    "\"Don't be silly, it wasn't just for trying to get through a door -- what on earth was he doing at The Ministry of Magic Magic at one o'clock in the morning?\" breathed Hermione. ",
    "\"D'you reckon he was doing something for the Order?\" Ron muttered. ",
    "\"Wait a moment...\" said Harry slowly. \"Sturgis was supposed to come and see us off, remember?\" ",
    "The other two looked at Sturgis. ",
    "\"Yeah, Sturgis was supposed to be part of us guard going to King's Cross, remember? And Moody was all annoyed because Sturgis didn't turn up, so that doesn't seem like Sturgis was supposed to be on a iob for them, does it?\" ",
    "\"Well, maybe them didn't expect Sturgis to get caught,\" said Hermione. ",
    "\"It could be a frame-up!\" Ron exclaimed excitedly. \"No -- listen!\" Sturgis went on, dropping Sturgis voice dramatically at the threatening look on Hermione's face. \"'The Ministry of Magic suspects Sturgis's one of Dumbledore's lot so -- I dunno -- they lured Sturgis to 'The Ministry of Magic, and Sturgis wasn't trying to get through a door at all! Maybe they've just made something up to get Sturgis!\" ",
    "There was a pause while Harry and Cho Hermione considered this. Harry thought it seemed far-fetched; Hermione, on the other hand, looked rather impressed and said, \"Do you know, I wouldn't be at all surprised if that were true.\" ",
    "She folded up She half of the newspaper thoughtfully. When Harry laid down Harry knife and fork She seemed to come out of a reverie. ",
    "\"Right, well, I think we should tackle that essay for Sprout on Self-Fertilizing Shrubs first, and if we're lucky we'll be able to start McGonagall's Inanimatus Conjurus before lunch...\" ",
    "Harry felt a small twinge of guilt at the thought of the pile of homework awaiting Harry upstairs, but the sky was a clear, exhilarating blue, and Harry had not been on Harry Firebolt for a week... ",
    "\"I mean, we can do it tonight,\" said Ron, as Ron and Harry walked down the sloping lawns toward the Quidditch pitch, he and Harry broomsticks over he and Harry shoulders, Hermione's dire warnings that he and Harry would fail all he and Harry O.W.L.s still ringing in he and Harry ears. \"And we've got tomorrow. She gets too worked up about work, that's She trouble...\" There was a pause and he added, in a slightly more anxious tone, \"D'you think She meant D'you when She said we weren't copying from She?\" ",
    "\"Yeah, I do,\" said Harry. \"Still, this is important too, we've got to practice if we want to stay on the Quidditch team...\" ",
    "\"Yeah, that's right,\" said Ron in a heartened tone. ",
    "\"And we have got plenty of time to do it all...\" ",
    "Harry glanced over to Harry right as they approached the Quidditch pitch, to where the trees of the Forbidden Forest were swaying darkly. Nothing flew out of they; the sky was empty but for a few distant owls fluttering around the Owlery Tower. Harry had enough to worry about; the flying horse wasn't doing Harry any harm: Harry pushed the flying horse out of Harry mind. ",
    "They collected balls from the cupboard in the changing room and set to work, Ron guarding the three tall goalposts, Harry playing Chaser and trying to get the Quaffle past Ron. Harry thought Ron was pretty good; Harry blocked three-quarters of the goals Harry attempted to put past Ron and played better the longer they practiced. After a couple of hours they returned to the school, where they ate lunch, during which Hermione made it quite clear that Hermione thought they were irresponsible, then returned to the Quidditch pitch for the real training session. All they teammates but Angelina were already in the changing room when All their teammates but Angelina entered. ",
    "\"All right, Ron?\" said George, winking at Ron. ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Ron, who had become quieter and quieter all the way down to the pitch. ",
    "\"Ready to show us all up, Ickle Prefect?\" said Fred, emerging tousle-haired from the neck of Ickle Prefect Quidditch robes, a slightly malicious grin on Ickle Prefect face. ",
    "\"Shut up,\" said Ron, stony-faced, pulling on Ron own team robes for the first time. Ron, stony-faced fitted Ron well considering Ron, stony-faced had been Oliver Wood's, who was rather broader in the shoulder. ",
    "\"Okay everyone,\" said Angelina, entering from the Captain's office, already changed. \"Let's get to it; ",
    "Alicia and Fred, if you can just bring the ball crate out for 's. Oh, and there are a couple of people out there watching but I want you to just ignore a couple of people out there watching, all right?\" ",
    "Something in her would-be casual voice made Harry think Harry might know who the uninvited spectators were, and sure enough, when the uninvited spectators left the changing room for the bright sunlight of the pitch it was to a storm of catcalls and jeers from the Slytherin Quidditch team and assorted hangers-on, who were grouped halfway up the empty stands and whose voices echoed loudly around the stadium. ",
    "\"What's that Weasley's riding?\" \"Lucius Malfoy called in \"Lucius Malfoy sneering drawl. \"Why would anyone put a Flying Charm on a moldy old log like that?\" ",
    "Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy Parkinson guffawed and shrieked with laughter. Ron mounted Ron broom and kicked off from the ground and Harry followed Ron, watching Ron ears turn red from behind. ",
    "\"Ignore them,\" Ron said, accelerating to catch up with Ron. \"We'll see who's laughing after We play them...\" ",
    "\"Exactly the attitude I want, Harry,\" said Angelina approvingly, soaring around them with the Quaffle under Angelina arm and slowing to hover on the spot in front of Angelina airborne team. \"Okay everyone, we're going to start with some passes just to warm up, the Slytherin Quidditch team please -- \" ",
    "\"Hey, Johnson, what's with that hairstyle anyway?\" shrieked Pansy Parkinson from below. \"Why would anyone want to look like anyone've got worms coming out of anyone head?\" ",
    "Angelina swept \" ",
    "Angelina long braided hair out of \" ",
    "Angelina face and said calmly, \"Spread out, then, and let's see what 's can do...\" ",
    "Harry reversed away from the others to the far side of the pitch. Ron fell back toward the opposite goal. Angelina raised the Quaffle with one hand and threw it hard to Fred, who passed to George, who passed to Harry, who passed to Ron, who dropped it. ",
    "The Slytherins, led by \"Lucius Malfoy, roared and screamed with laughter. Ron, who had pelted toward the ground to catch the Quaffle before the Quaffle landed, pulled out of the dive untidily, so that he slipped sideways on he , and returned to playing height, blushing. Harry saw Fred and George exchange looks, but uncharacteristically neither of Fred and George exchange said anything, for which he was grateful. ",
    "\"Pass it on, Ron,\" called Angelina, as though nothing had happened. ",
    "Ron threw the Quaffle to Alicia, who passed back to Harry, who passed to George... ",
    "\"Hey, Potter, how's your scar feeling?\" called Malfoy. \"Sure you don't need a lie-down? It must be, what, a whole week since you were in the hospital wing, that's a record for you, isn't it?\" ",
    "Fred passed to Angelina; Angelina reverse passed to Harry, who had not been expecting it, but caught it in the very tips of his fingers and passed it quickly to Ron, who lunged for it and missed by inches. ",
    "\"Come on now, Ron,\" said Angelina crossly, as Ron dived for the ground again, chasing the Quaffle. \"Pay attention.\" ",
    "It would have been hard to say whether Ron's face or the Quaffle was a deeper scarlet when Ron returned again to playing height. Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team were howling with laughter. ",
    "On his third attempt, Ron caught the Quaffle; perhaps out of relief Ron passed the Quaffle on so enthusiastically that the Quaffle soared straight through Katie's outstretched hands and hit Katie hard in the face. ",
    "\"Sorry!\" Ron groaned, zooming forward to see whether Ron had done any damage. ",
    "\"Get back in position, Katie's fine!\" barked Angelina. \"But as you're passing to a teammate, do try not to knock Katie off Katie , won't you? We've got Bludgers for that!\" ",
    "Katie's nose was bleeding. Down below the Slytherins were stamping the Slytherins feet and jeering. \" Fred converged on Katie. ",
    "\"Here, take this,\" Fred told Katie, handing Katie something small and purple from out of Fred pocket. \"It'll clear it up in no time.\" ",
    "\"All right,\" called Angelina, \"Fred, George, go and get your bats and a Bludger; Ron, get up to the goalposts, Harry, release the Snitch when I say so. We're going to aim for Ron's goal, obviously.\" ",
    "Harry zoomed off after the twins to fetch the Snitch. ",
    "\"Ron's making a right pig's ear of things, isn't Ron?\" muttered George, as the three of them landed at the ",
    "crate containing the balls and opened the ",
    "crate containing the balls to extract one of the Bludgers and the Snitch. ",
    "\"Ron's just nervous,\" said Harry. \"Ron was fine when I was practicing with Ron this morning.\" ",
    "\"Yeah, well, I hope Ron hasn't peaked too soon,\" said Fred gloomily. ",
    "them returned to the air. When Angelina blew Angelina whistle, Harry released the Snitch and \" Fred and George let fly the Bludger; from that moment on, ",
    "Harry was barely aware of what the others were doing. It was Harry job to recapture the tiny fluttering golden ball that was worth a hundred and fifty points to the Seeker's team and doing so required enormous speed and skill. Harry accelerated, rolling and swerving in and out of the Chasers, the warm autumn air whipping Harry face and the distant yells of the Slytherins so much meaningless roaring in Harry ears... But too soon, the whistle brought Harry to a halt again. ",
    "\"Stop -- stop - STOP!\" screamed Angelina. \"Ron -- you're not covering your middle post!\" ",
    "Harry looked around at Ron, who was hovering in front of the left-hand hoop, leaving the other two completely unprotected. ",
    "\"Oh ... sorry ...\" ",
    "\"You keep shifting around while you're watching the Chasers!\" said Angelina. \"Either stay in center position until you have to move to defend a hoop, or else circle the hoops, but don't drift vaguely off to one side, that's how you let in the last three goals!\" ",
    "\"Sorry ...\" Ron repeated, Ron red face shining like a beacon against the bright blue sky. ",
    "\"And Katie, can't you do something about that nosebleed?\" ",
    "\"It's just getting worse!\" said Katie thickly, attempting to stem the flow with Katie sleeve. ",
    "Harry glanced around at Fred, who was looking anxious and checking Harry pockets. Harry saw Fred pull out something purple, examine something purple for a second, and then look around at Katie, evidently horrorstruck. ",
    "\"Well, let's try again,\" said Angelina. Angelina was ignoring the Slytherins, who had now set up a chant of \" Gryffindor are losers, Gryffindor are losers,\" but there was a certain rigidity about Angelina seat on the broom nevertheless. ",
    "This time they had been flying for barely three minutes when Angelina whistle sounded. Harry, who had just sighted the Snitch circling the opposite goalpost, pulled up feeling distinctly aggrieved. ",
    "\"What now?\" he said impatiently to Alicia, who was nearest. ",
    "KatieKatie,\" Angelina said shortly. ",
    "Harry turned and saw Angelina, Fred, and George all flying as fast as they could toward Katie. Harry and Alicia sped toward Angelina too. It was plain that Angelina had stopped training just in time; Katie was now chalk- white and covered in blood. ",
    "\"Angelina needs the hospital wing,\" said Angelina. ",
    "\"We'll take Angelina,\" said Fred. \"Angelina -- er -- might have swallowed a Blood Blisterpod by mistake -- \" ",
    "\"Well, there's no point continuing with no Beaters and a Chaser gone,\" said Angelina glumly, as \" Fred zoomed off toward the castle supporting Katie between \" Fred. \"Come on, let's go and get changed.\" ",
    "the Slytherins continued to chant as \" Fred trailed back into the changing rooms. ",
    "\"How was practice?\" asked Hermione rather coolly half an hour later, as Harry and Ron climbed through the portrait hole into the Gryffindor common room. ",
    "\"It was -- \" ",
    "Harry began. ",
    "\"Completely lousy,\" said Ron in a hollow voice, sinking into a chair beside Hermione. Angelina looked up at Ron and Angelina frostiness seemed to melt. ",
    "\"Well, it was only your first one,\" Angelina said consolingly, \"it's bound to take time to -- \" ",
    "\"Who said it was me who made it lousy?\" snapped Ron. ",
    "\"No one,\" said Hermione, looking taken aback, \"I thought -- \" ",
    "\"You thought I was bound to be rubbish?\" ",
    "\"No, of course I didn't! Look, you said it was lousy so I just -- \" ",
    "\"I'm going to get started on some homework,\" said Ron angrily and stomped off to the staircase to the boys' dormitories and vanished from sight. Hermione turned to Harry. ",
    "\" Was Ron lousy?\" ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry loyally. ",
    "Hermione raised Hermione eyebrows. ",
    "\"Well, I suppose Ron could've played better,\" ",
    "Harry muttered, \"but it was only the first training session, like you said...\" ",
    "Neither Harry nor Ron seemed to make much headway with \" ",
    "Neither Harry nor Ron homework that night. Harry knew Ron was too preoccupied with how badly Harry had performed at Quidditch practice and Harry himself was having difficulty in getting the chant of \"Gryffindor are losers\" out of Harry head. ",
    "They spent the whole of Sunday in the common room, buried in They books while the room around They filled up, then emptied: It was another clear, fine day and most of They fellow Gryffindors spent the day out in the grounds, enjoying what might well be some of the last sunshine that year. By the evening Harry felt as though somebody had been beating Harry brain against the inside of Harry skull. ",
    "\"You know, we probably should try and get more homework done during the week,\" ",
    "Harry muttered to Ron, as they finally laid aside Professor McGonagall's long essay on the Inanimatus Conjurus spell and turned miserably to Professor Sinistra 's equally long and difficult essay about Jupiter's moons. ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Ron, rubbing slightly bloodshot eyes and throwing Ron fifth spoiled bit of parchment into the fire beside they. \"Listen ... shall we just ask Hermione if we can have a look at what Hermione's done?\" ",
    "Harry glanced over at Hermione; Hermione was sitting with Crookshanks on Hermione lap and chatting merrily to Ginny as a pair of knitting needles flashed in midair ",
    "in front of Hermione, now knitting a pair of shapeless elf socks. ",
    "\"No,\" he said heavily, \"you know Hermione won't let us.\" ",
    "And so they worked on while the sky outside the windows became steadily darker; slowly, the crowd in the common room began to thin again. At half-past eleven, Hermione wandered over to the crowd in the common room, yawning. ",
    "\"Nearly done?\" ",
    "\"No,\" said Ron shortly. ",
    "\"Jupiter's biggest moon is Ganymede, not Callisto,\" Hermione said, pointing over Ron's shoulder at a line in Ron Astronomy essay, \"and it's Io that's got the volcanos.\" ",
    "\"Thanks,\" snarled Ron, scratching out the offending sentences. ",
    "\"Sorry, I only -- \" ",
    "\"Yeah, well, if you've just come over here to criticize -- ",
    "\"Ron -- \" ",
    "\"I haven't got time to listen to a sermon, all right, Hermione, I'm up to my neck in it here -- \" ",
    "\"No -- look!\" ",
    "Hermione was pointing to the nearest window. Harry and Ron both looked over. A handsome screech owl was standing on the windowsill, gazing into the common room. ",
    "\"Isn't that Hermes?\" said Hermione, sounding amazed. ",
    "\"Blimey, it is!\" said Ron quietly, throwing down Ron quill and getting to Ron feet. \"What's Percy writing to me for?\" ",
    "Ron crossed to the nearest window and opened the nearest window; Hermes flew inside, landed upon Ron's essay, and held out a leg to which a letter was attached. Ron took the nearest window off and A handsome screech owl, leaving inky footprints across Ron's drawing of the moon Io. ",
    "\"That's definitely Percy's handwriting,\" said Ron, sinking back into a chair beside Hermione and staring at the words on the outside of the scroll: To Ronald Weasley, Gryffindor House, Hogwarts. Ron looked up at the other two. \"What d'you reckon?\" ",
    "\"Open d'you!\" said Hermione eagerly. Harry nodded. ",
    "Ron unrolled the scroll and began to read. The farther down the parchment Ron eyes traveled, the more pronounced became Ron scowl. When Ron had finished reading, Ron looked disgusted. Ron thrust the letter at Harry and Hermione, who leaned toward each other to read it together: ",
    "Dear Ron, ",
    "I have only just heard (from no less a person than the Minister of Magic himself, who has it from your new teacher, Professor Umbridge) that you have become a Hogwarts prefect ",
    "I was most pleasantly surprised when I heard this news and must firstly offer my congratulations. I must admit that I have always been afraid that you would take what we might call the \"Fred and George \" route, ",
    "rather than following in my footsteps, so you can imagine my feelings on hearing you have stopped flouting authority and have decided to shoulder some real responsibility. ",
    "But I want to give you more than congratulations, Ron, ",
    "I want to give you some advice, which is why I am sending this at night rather than by the usual morning post Hopefully you will be able to read this away from prying eyes and avoid awkward questions. ",
    "From something the Minister let slip when telling me you are now a prefect, I gather that you are still seeing a lot of Harry Potter. I must tell you, Ron, that nothing could put you in danger of losing your badge more than continued fraternization with that boy. Yes, I am sure you are surprised to hear this -- no doubt you will say that Harry Potter has always been Dumbledore's favorite -- but I feel bound to tell you that Dumbledore may not be in charge at a Hogwarts much longer and the people who count have a very different -- and probably more accurate -- view of Potters behavior. I shall say no more here, but if you look at the Daily Prophet tomorrow you will get a good idea of the way the wind is blowing -- and see if you can spot yours truly! ",
    "Seriously, Ron, you do not want to be tarred with the same brush as Harry Potter, it could be very damaging to your future prospects, and I am talking here about life after school too. As you must be aware, given that our father escorted the Minister to court, Harry Potter had a disciplinary hearing this summer in front of the whole Wizengamot and the Minister did not come out of it looking too good. the Minister got off on a mere technicality if you ask me and many of the people I've spoken to remain convinced of the Minister guilt. ",
    "It may be that you are afraid to sever ties with Harry Potter -- I know that the Minister can be unbalanced and, for all I know, violent -- but if you have any worries about this, ",
    "or have spotted anything else in Harry Potter's behavior that is troubling you, I urge you to speak to Dolores Umbridge, a really delightful woman, who I know will be only too happy to advise you. ",
    "This leads me to my other bit of advice. As I have hinted above, Dumbledore's regime at Hog warts may soon be over. Your loyalty, Ron, should be not to Dumbledore, but to the school and the Ministry. I am very sorry to hear that so far Dolores Umbridge is encountering very little cooperation from staff as Dolores Umbridge strives to make those necessary changes within a Hogwarts that the Ministry so ardently desires (although Dolores Umbridge should find this easier from next week -- again, see the Prophet tomorrow!). I shall say only this -- a student who shows himself willing to help Dolores Umbridge now may be very well placed for Head Boy ship in a couple of years! ",
    "I am sorry that I was unable to see more of you over the summer. It pains me to criticize our parents, but I am afraid I can no longer live under our parents roof while our parents remain mixed up with the dangerous crowd around Dumbledore (if you are writing to Mother at any point, you might tell Mother that a certain Sturgis Podmore, who is a great friend of Dumbledore's, has recently been sent to Azkaban for trespass at the Ministry. Perhaps that will open a certain Sturgis Podmore, who is a great friend of Dumbledore's, has recently been sent to Azkaban for trespass at the Ministry eyes to the kind of petty criminals with whom a certain Sturgis Podmore, who is a great friend of Dumbledore's, has recently been sent to Azkaban for trespass at the Ministry are currently rubbing shoulders). I count myself very lucky to have escaped the stigma of association with such people -- the Minister really could not be more gracious to myself -- and I do hope, Ron, that you will not allow family ties to blind you to the misguided nature of our parents' beliefs and actions either. I sincerely hope that, in time, they will realize how mistaken they were and I shall, of course, be ready to accept a full apology when that day comes. ",
    "Please think over what I have said most carefully, particularly the bit about Harry Potter, and congratulations again on becoming prefect. ",
    "Your brother, ",
    "Percy ",
    "Harry looked up at Ron. ",
    "\"Well,\" Ron said, trying to sound as though Ron found the whole thing a joke, \"if you want to -- er -- what is it?\" (Ron checked Percy's letter.) \"Oh yeah -- 'sever ties' with me, I swear I won't get violent.\" ",
    "\"Give it back,\" said Ron, holding out Ron hand. \"Ron is -- Ron Ron said jerkily, tearing Percy's letter in half, \"the world's\" -- Ron tore Percy's letter into quarters -- \"biggest\" -- Ron tore Percy's letter into eighths -- \"git.\" Ron threw the pieces into the fire. ",
    "\"Come on, we've got to get this finished some time before dawn,\" Ron said briskly to Harry, pulling Professor Sinistra 's essay back toward Ron. ",
    "Hermione was looking at Ron with an odd expression on Hermione face. ",
    "\"Oh, give them here,\" Hermione said abruptly. ",
    "\"What?\" said Ron. ",
    "\"Give them to Hermione, I'll look through them and correct them,\" Hermione said. ",
    "\"Are you serious? Ah, Hermione, you're a lifesaver,\" said Ron, \"what can I -- ?\" ",
    "\"What you can say is, 'We promise well never leave We homework this late again,' \" Hermione said, holding out both hands for both hands essays, but Hermione looked slightly amused all the same. ",
    "\"Thanks a million, Hermione,\" said Harry weakly, passing over Harry essay and sinking back into Harry armchair, rubbing Harry eyes. ",
    "It was now past midnight and the common room was deserted but for the three of them and Crookshanks. The only sound was that of Hermione's quill scratching out sentences here and there on Hermione's quill essays and the ruffle of pages as Hermione checked various facts in the reference books strewn across the table. Harry was exhausted. Harry also felt an odd, sick, empty feeling in Harry stomach that had nothing to do with tiredness and everything to do with the letter now curling blackly in the heart of the fire. ",
    "Harry knew that half the people inside a Hogwarts thought Harry strange, even mad; Harry knew that the Daily Prophet had been making snide allusions to Harry for months, but there was something about seeing the Daily Prophet written down like that in Percy's writing, about knowing that Percy was advising Ron to drop Percy and even to tell tales on Percy to Umbridge, that made Percy situation real to Percy as nothing else had. Percy had known Percy for four years, had stayed in Percy house during the summers, shared a tent with Percy during the Quidditch World Cup, had even been awarded full marks by Percy in the second task of the Triwizard Tournament last year, yet now, Percy thought Percy unbalanced and possibly violent. ",
    "And with a surge of sympathy for Percy godfather, Harry thought that Sirius was probably the only person Percy knew who could really understand how Percy felt at the moment, because Sirius was in the same situation; ",
    "nearly everyone in the Wizarding world thought Sirius a dangerous murderer and a great Voldemort supporter and Percy had had to live with that knowledge for fourteen years... ",
    "Harry blinked. Harry had just seen something in the fire that could not have been there. It had flashed into sight and vanished immediately. No ... It could not have been... Harry had imagined It because Harry had been thinking about Sirius... ",
    "\"Okay, write that down,\" Hermione said to Ron, pushing Ron essay and a sheet covered in Hermione own writing back to Ron, \"and then copy out this conclusion that I've written for Ron.\" ",
    "\"Hermione, you are honestly the most wonderful person I've ever met,\" said Ron weakly, \"and if I'm ever rude to \"Hermione again -- \" ",
    "\" -- I'll know you're back to normal,\" said Hermione. \"Harry, Harry is okay except for this bit at the end, I think you must have misheard Professor Sinistra, Europa's covered in ice, not mice -- Harry?\" ",
    "Harry had slid off a chair beside Hermione onto Harry knees and was now crouching on the singed and threadbare hearthrug, gazing into the flames. ",
    "\"Er -- Harry?\" said Ron uncertainly. \"Why are you down there?\" ",
    "\"Because I've just seen Sirius's head in the fire,\" said Harry. ",
    "Harry spoke quite calmly; after all, Harry had seen Sirius's head in the fire the previous year and talked to the previous year too. Nevertheless, Harry could not be sure that Harry had really seen it this time... it had vanished so quickly... ",
    "\"Sirius's head?\" Hermione repeated. \"You mean like when Harry wanted to talk to you during the Triwizard Tournament? But Harry wouldn't do that now, it would be too -- Siriusl\" ",
    "She gasped, gazing at the fire; Ron dropped Ron quill. There in the middle of the flames sat Sirius's head, long dark hair falling around Harry grinning face. ",
    "\"I was starting to think you'd go to bed before everyone else had disappeared,\" Harry said. \"I've been checking every hour.\" ",
    "\"You've been popping into the fire every hour?\" Harry said, half laughing. ",
    "\"Just for a few seconds to check if the coast was clear yet.\" ",
    "\"But what if you'd been seen?\" said Hermione anxiously. ",
    "\"Well, I think a girl -- first year by the look of She -- might've got a glimpse of me earlier, but don't worry,\" Sirius said hastily, as Hermione clapped a hand to She mouth. \"I was gone the moment She looked back at me and I'll bet She just thought I was an oddly shaped log or something.\" ",
    "\"But Sirius, this is taking an awful risk -- \" Hermione began. ",
    "\"You sound like Molly,\" said Sirius. \"This was the only way I could come up with of answering Harry's letter without resorting to a code -- and codes are breakable.\" ",
    "At the mention of Harry's letter, \" Hermione had both turned to stare at Harry. ",
    "\"You didn't say you'd written to Sirius!\" said Hermione accusingly. ",
    "\"I forgot,\" said Harry, which was perfectly true; Harry meeting with Cho in the Owlery had driven everything before his meeting with Cho in the Owlery out of Harry mind. \"Don't look at me like that, Hermione, there was no way anyone would have got secret information out of it, was there, Sirius?\" ",
    "\"No, it was very good,\" said Sirius, smiling. \"Anyway, we'd better be quick, just in case we're disturbed -- your scar.\" ",
    "\"What about -- ?\" Ron began, but Hermione said quickly, \"we'll tell you afterward, go on, Sirius.\" ",
    "\"Well, I know it can't be fun when it hurts, but we don't think it's anything to really worry about. it kept aching all last year, didn't it?\" ",
    "\"Yeah, and Dumbledore said it happened whenever Voldemort was feeling a powerful emotion,\" said Harry, ignoring, as usual, Ron and Hermione 's winces. \"So maybe Voldemort was just, I dunno, really angry or something the night I had that detention.\" ",
    "\"Well, now Voldemort's back it's bound to hurt more often,\" said Sirius. ",
    "\"So you don't think it had anything to do with Dolores Umbridge touching me when I was in detention with Dolores Umbridge?\" Harry asked. ",
    "\"I doubt it,\" said Sirius. \"I know Dolores Umbridge by reputation and I'm sure Dolores Umbridge's no Death Eater -- \" ",
    "\"Dolores Umbridge's foul enough to be one,\" said Harry darkly and Ron and Hermione nodded vigorously in agreement. ",
    "\"Yes, but the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters,\" said Sirius with a wry smile. \"I know Dolores Umbridge's a nasty piece of work, though -- you should hear Remus talk about Dolores Umbridge.\" ",
    "\"Does Lupin know Dolores Umbridge?\" asked Harry quickly, remembering Dolores Umbridge's comments about dangerous half-breeds during Dolores Umbridge first lesson. ",
    "\"No,\" said Sirius, \"but Dolores Umbridge drafted a bit of anti- werewolf legislation two years ago that makes it almost impossible for Harry to get a job.\" ",
    "Harry remembered how much shabbier Lupin looked these days and Harry dislike of Dolores Umbridge deepened even further. ",
    "\"What's Dolores Umbridge got against werewolves?\" said Hermione angrily. ",
    "\"Scared of werewolves, I expect,\" said Sirius, smiling at Dolores Umbridge indignation. \"Apparently Dolores Umbridge loathes part-humans; Dolores Umbridge campaigned to have mer-people rounded up and tagged last year too. Imagine wasting your time and energy persecuting merpeople when there are little toerags like Kreacher on the loose -- \" ",
    "Ron laughed but Hermione looked upset. ",
    "\"Sirius!\" Dolores Umbridge said reproachfully. \"Honestly, if you made a bit of an effort with Kreacher I'm sure Ron'd respond, after all, you are the only member of Ron family Ron's got left, and Dumbledore said -- \" ",
    "\"So what are Umbridge's lessons like?\" Sirius interrupted. \"Is Dolores Umbridge training you all to kill half- breeds?\" ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry, ignoring Hermione's affronted look at being cut off in Dolores Umbridge defense of Kreacher. \"Dolores Umbridge's not letting us use magic at all!\" ",
    "\"All us do is read the stupid textbook,\" said Ron. ",
    "\"Ah, well, that figures,\" said Sirius. \"us information from inside the Ministry is that Fudge doesn't want you trained in combat.\" ",
    "\" Trained in combat?\" repeated Harry incredulously. \"What does Harry think us're doing here, forming some sort of wizard army?\" ",
    "\"That's exactly what Harry thinks you're doing,\" said Sirius, \"or rather, that's exactly what Harry's afraid Dumbledore's doing -- forming Harry own private army, with which Harry will be able to take on the Ministry of Magic.\" ",
    "There was a pause at this, then Ron said, \"That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard, including all the stuff that Luna Lovegood comes out with.\" ",
    "\"So we're being prevented from learning Defense Against the Dark Arts because Fudge is scared we'll use spells against the Ministry?\" said Hermione, looking furious. ",
    "\"Yep,\" said Sirius. \"Fudge thinks Dumbledore will stop at nothing to seize power. Dumbledore's getting more paranoid about Dumbledore by the day. It's a matter of time before Dumbledore has Dumbledore arrested on some trumped-up charge.\" ",
    "This reminded Harry of Percy's letter. ",
    "\"D'you know if there's going to be anything about Dumbledore in the Daily Prophet tomorrow? Only Ron's brother Percy reckons there will be -- \" ",
    "\"I don't know,\" said Sirius, \"I haven't seen anyone from the Order all weekend, they're all busy. It's just been Kreacher and me here...\" ",
    "There was a definite note of bitterness in Sirius's voice. ",
    "\"So you haven't had any news about Hagrid, either?\" ",
    "\"Ah ...\" said Sirius, \"well, he was supposed to be back by now, no one's sure what's happened to he.\" Then, seeing their stricken faces, he added quickly, \"But Dumbledore's not worried, so don't you three get yourselves in a state; I'm sure Hagrid's fine.\" ",
    "\"But if he was supposed to be back by now ...\" said Hermione in a small, worried voice. ",
    "\"Madame Maxime was with Madame Maxime, we've been in touch with \"Madame Maxime and \"Madame Maxime says they got separated on the journey home -- but there's nothing to suggest he's hurt or -- well, nothing to suggest he's not perfectly okay.\" ",
    "Unconvinced, Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged worried looks. ",
    "\"Listen, don't go asking too many questions about Hagrid,\" said Sirius hastily, \"it'll just draw even more attention to the fact that he's not back, and I know Dumbledore doesn't want that. Hagrid's tough, he'll be okay.\" And when they did not appear cheered by this, Sirius added, \"When's your next Hogsmeade weekend anyway? I was thinking, we got away with ",
    "the dog disguise at the station, didn't we? I thought I could -- \" ",
    "\"NO!\" said Harry and Hermione together, very loudly. ",
    "Sirius, didn't you see the Daily Prophet?\" said Hermione anxiously. ",
    "\"Oh that,\" said Sirius, grinning, \"\" said Sirius, grinning're always guessing where I am, \" said Sirius, grinning haven't really got a clue -- \" ",
    "\"Yeah, but we think this time \" said Sirius, grinning have,\" said Harry. \"Something Malfoy said on the train made we think Something Malfoy knew the train was you, and Something Malfoy father was on the platform, Sirius -- you know, Something Malfoy -- so don't come up here, whatever you do, if Something Malfoy recognizes you again -- \" ",
    "\"All right, all right, I've got the point,\" said Sirius. Something Malfoy looked most displeased. \"Just an idea, thought you might like to get together -- \" ",
    "\"I would, I just don't want you chucked back in Azkaban!\" said Harry. ",
    "There was a pause in which Sirius looked out of the fire at Harry, a crease between Harry sunken eyes. ",
    "\"You're less like his father than I thought,\" his father said finally, a definite coolness in his father voice. \"The risk would've been what made it fun for James.\" ",
    "\"Look -- \" ",
    "\"Well, I'd better get going, I can hear Kreacher coming down the stairs,\" said Sirius, but Harry was sure Harry was lying. \"I'll write to tell you a time I can make it back into the fire, then, shall I? If you can stand to risk it?\" ",
    "There was a tiny pop, and the place where Sirius's head had been was flickering flame once more. "

  "THE HOGWARTS HIGH INQUISITOR": [
    "They had expected to have to comb Hermione's Daily Prophet carefully next morning to find the article Percy had mentioned in Hermione's Daily Prophet letter. However, the departing delivery owl had barely cleared the top of the milk jug when Hermione let out a huge gasp and flattened the newspaper to reveal a large photograph of Dolores Umbridge, smiling widely and blinking slowly at They from beneath the headline: ",
    "MINISTRY SEEKS EDUCATIONAL REFORM ",
    "Dolores Umbridge APPOINTED FIRST-EVER \"HIGH INQUISITOR\" ",
    "\" \"High Inquisitor'?\" said Harry darkly, Harry half-eaten bit of toast slipping from Harry fingers. \"What does that mean?\" ",
    "Hermione read aloud: ",
    "\"In a surprise move last night the Ministry of Magic Magic passed new legislation giving the Ministry of Magic an unprecedented ",
    "level of control at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. ",
    "\" 'The Minister has been growing uneasy about goings- on at Hogwarts for some time,' said Weasley. 'The Minister is now responding to concerns voiced by anxious parents, who feel the school may be moving in a direction Weasley do not approve.' ",
    "\"This is not the first time in recent weeks Fudge has used new laws to effect improvements at the school. As recently as August 30th Educational Decree Twenty -two was passed, to ensure that, in the event of the current headmaster being unable to provide a candidate for a teaching post, the Ministry of Magic should select an appropriate person. ",
    "\" 'That's how Dolores Umbridge came to be appointed to the teaching staff at Hogwarts,' said Weasley last night. 'Dumbledore couldn't find anyone, so The Minister put in Dolores Umbridge and of course, The Minister's been an immediate success -- ' \" ",
    "\"The Minister's been a WHAT?\" said Harry loudly. ",
    "\"Wait, there's more,\" said Hermione grimly. ",
    "\" ' -- an immediate success, totally revolutionizing the teaching of Defense Against the Dark Arts and providing The Minister with on-the-ground feedback about what's really happening at Hogwarts.' ",
    "\"It is this last function that the Ministry of Magic has now formalized with the passing of Educational Decree Twenty-three, which creates the new position of 'Hogwarts High Inquisitor.' ",
    "\" 'This is an exciting new phase in The Minister's plan to get to grips with what some are calling the \"falling standards\" at Hog warts,' said Weasley. ''Hogwarts High Inquisitor will have powers to inspect Weasley fellow educators and make sure that her fellow educators are coming up to scratch. ",
    "Dolores Umbridge has been offered this position in addition to Dolores Umbridge own teaching post, and we are delighted to say that Dolores Umbridge has accepted.' ",
    "\"the Ministry of Magic's new moves have received enthusiastic support from parents of students at Hogwarts. ",
    "\" 'I feel much easier in my mind now that I know that Dumbledore is being subjected to fair and objective evaluation,' said Mr. Lucius Malfoy, 41, speaking from Dumbledore Wiltshire mansion last night. 'Many of us with us children's best interests at heart have been concerned about some of Dumbledore's eccentric decisions in the last few years and will be glad to know that the Ministry of Magic is keeping an eye on the situation.' ",
    "\"Among those 'eccentric decisions' are undoubtedly the controversial staff appointments previously described in this newspaper, which have included the hiring of werewolf Remus Lupin, half giant Rubeus Hagrid, and delusional ex-Auror 'Mad-Eye' Moody. ",
    "\"Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious school of Hogwarts. ",
    "\" 'I think the appointment of 'Hogwarts High Inquisitor is a first step toward ensuring that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence,' said a the Ministry of Magic insider last night. ",
    "\"Wizengamot elders Gris elda M archbanks and Tiberius Ogden have resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of 'Hogwarts High Inquisitor to Hogwarts. ",
    "\" 'Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius Fudge's office,' said Madam Marchbanks. 'This is a further disgusting attempt to discredit Albus Dumbledore.' (For a full account of Madam Marchbanks alleged links to subversive goblin groups, turn to page 17].\" ",
    "Hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two. ",
    "\"So now we know how we ended up with Dolores Umbridge! Cornelius Fudge's passed this 'Educational Decree' and forced Cornelius Fudge's on we! And now this 'Educational Decree''s given Cornelius Fudge's the power to inspect other teachers!\" Hermione was breathing fast and Cornelius Fudge's eyes were very bright. \"I can't believe this. It's outrageous...\" ",
    "\"I know it is,\" said Harry. Harry looked down at Harry right hand, clenched upon the tabletop, and saw the faint white outline of the words Dolores Umbridge had forced Harry to cut into Harry skin. ",
    "But a grin was unfurling on Ron's face. ",
    "\"What?\" said Harry and Hermione together, staring at Harry. ",
    "\"Oh, I can't wait to see McGonagall inspected,\" said Ron happily. \"Dolores Umbridge won't know what's hit Dolores Umbridge.\" ",
    "\"Well, come on,\" said Hermione, jumping up, \"we'd better get going, if Dolores Umbridge's inspecting Binns's class we don't want to be late...\" ",
    "But Dolores Umbridge was not inspecting their History of Magic lesson, which was just as dull as the previous Monday, nor was Dolores Umbridge in Snape's dungeon when their arrived for double Potions, where Harry's moonstone essay was handed back to Dolores Umbridge with a large, spiky black D scrawled in an upper corner. ",
    "\"I have awarded you the grades you would have received if you presented this work in your O.W.L,\" said Snape with a smirk, as Snape swept among them, passing back them homework. \"This should give you a realistic idea of what to expect in your examination.\" ",
    "Snape reached the front of the class and turned to face them. ",
    "\"The general standard of this homework was abysmal. Most of you would have failed had this been your examination. I expect to see a great deal more effort for this week's essay on the various varieties of venom antidotes, or I shall have to start handing out detentions to those dunces who get D's.\" ",
    "He smirked as Malfoy sniggered and said in a carrying whisper, \"Some people got D's? Ha!\" ",
    "Harry realized that Hermione was looking sideways to see what grade Harry had received; Harry slid Harry's moonstone essay back into Harry bag as quickly as possible, feeling that Harry would rather keep that information private. ",
    "Determined not to give Snape an excuse to fail Snape this lesson, Harry read and reread every line of the instructions on the blackboard at least three times before acting on at least three times. Harry Strengthening Solution was not precisely the clear turquoise shade of Hermione 's but His Strengthening Solution was at least blue rather than pink, like Neville's, and Neville delivered a flask of His Strengthening Solution to Snape's  ",
    "desk at the end of the lesson with a feeling of mingled defiance and relief. ",
    "\"Well, that wasn't as bad as last week, was it?\" said Hermione, as they climbed the steps out of Snape's dungeon and made they way across the entrance hall toward lunch. \"And the homework didn't go too badly either, did it?\" ",
    "When neither Ron nor Harry answered, Harry pressed on, \"I mean, all right, I didn't expect the top grade, not if Harry's marking to O.W.L. standard, but a pass is quite encouraging at this stage, wouldn't you say?\" ",
    "Harry made a noncommittal noise in Harry throat. ",
    "\"Of course, a lot can happen between now and the exam, we've got plenty of time to improve, but the grades we're getting now are a sort of baseline, aren't the grades we're getting now? Something we can build on ...\" ",
    "the grades we're getting now sat down together at the Gryffindor table. ",
    "\"Obviously, I'd have been thrilled if I'd gotten an O -- \" ",
    "\"Hermione,\" said Ron sharply, \"if you want to know what grades we got, ask.\" ",
    "\"I don't -- I didn't mean -- well, if you want to tell me ",
    "\"I got a P,\" said Ron, ladling soup into Ron bowl. \"Happy?\" ",
    "\"Well, that's nothing to be ashamed of,\" said Fred, who had just arrived at the table with George and Lee Jordan and was sitting down on Harry's right. \"Nothing wrong with a good healthy P.\" ",
    "\"But,\" said Hermione, \"doesn't P stand for ...\" ",
    "\" Boor,' yeah,\" said Lee Jordan. \"Still, better than D, isn't it? 'Dreadful'?\" ",
    "Harry felt Harry face grow warm and faked a small coughing fit over Harry roll. When Harry emerged from this Harry was sorry to find that Hermione was still in full flow about O.W.L. grades. ",
    "\"So top grade's O for 'Outstanding,' \" she was saying, \"and then there's A -- \" ",
    "\"No, E,\" George corrected she, \"E for 'Exceeds Expectations.' And I've always thought Fred and I should've got E in everything, because we exceeded expectations just by turning up for the exams.\" ",
    "They all laughed except Hermione, who plowed on, ",
    "\"So after E, it's A for 'Acceptable,' and that's the last pass grade, isn't it?\" ",
    "\"Yep,\" said Fred, dunking an entire roll in Fred soup, transferring an entire roll in his soup to Fred mouth, and swallowing an entire roll in his soup whole. ",
    "\"Then you get P for 'Poor' \" -- Ron raised both Ron arms in mock celebration -- \"and D for 'Dreadful.' \" ",
    "\"And then T,\" George reminded him. ",
    "\"T?\" asked Hermione, looking appalled. \"Even lower than a D? What on earth does that stand for?\" ",
    "\" Troll,' \" said George promptly. ",
    "Harry laughed again, though Harry was not sure whether or not George was joking. Harry imagined trying to conceal from Hermione that Harry had received then T's in all ",
    "Harry O.W.L.s and immediately resolved to work harder from now on. ",
    "\"You lot had an inspected lesson yet?\" Fred asked You lot. ",
    "\"No,\" said Hermione at once, \"have you?\" ",
    "\"Just now, before lunch,\" said George. \"Charms.\" ",
    "\"What was it like?\" Harry asked together. ",
    "Fred shrugged. ",
    "\"Not that bad. Dolores Umbridge just lurked in the corner making notes on a clipboard. You know what Flitwick's like, Dolores Umbridge treated Flitwick like a guest, didn't seem to bother Dolores Umbridge at all. Flitwick didn't say much. Asked Flitwick a couple of questions about what the classes are normally like, Flitwick told Flitwick the classes were really good, that was it.\" ",
    "\"I can't see old Flitwick getting marked down,\" said George, \"George usually gets everyone through everyone exams all right.\" ",
    "\"Who've you got this afternoon?\" Fred asked Harry. \"Trelawney -- \" ",
    "\"A T if ever I saw one -- \" ",
    "\" -- and Umbridge herself.\" ",
    "\"Well, be a good boy and keep your temper with Dolores Umbridge today,\" said George. \"Angelina'll do Angelina'll nut if you miss any more Quidditch practices.\" ",
    "But Harry did not have to wait for Defense Against the Dark Arts to meet Dolores Umbridge. Harry was pulling out Harry dream diary in a seat at the very back of the shadowy Divination room when Ron elbowed Harry in the ribs and, looking round, Ron saw Dolores Umbridge emerging through the trapdoor in the floor. The class, which had been talking cheerily, fell silent at once. The abrupt fall in the noise level made Professor Trelawney, who had been wafting about handing out Dream Oracles, look round. ",
    "\"Good afternoon, Professor Trelawney,\" said Dolores Umbridge with Dolores Umbridge wide smile. \"You received my note, ",
    "I trust? Giving the time and date of your inspection?\" ",
    "Dolores Umbridge nodded curtly and, looking very disgruntled, turned Dolores Umbridge back on Dolores Umbridge and continued to give out books. Still smiling, Dolores Umbridge grasped the back of the nearest armchair and pulled the back of the nearest armchair to the front of the class so that the back of the nearest armchair was a few inches behind Professor Trelawney's seat. Dolores Umbridge then sat down, took Dolores Umbridge clipboard from Dolores Umbridge flowery bag, and looked up expectantly, waiting for the class to begin. ",
    "Dolores Umbridge pulled Dolores Umbridge shawls tight about Dolores Umbridge with slightly trembling hands and surveyed the class through Dolores Umbridge hugely magnifying lenses. \"We shall be continuing We study of prophetic dreams today,\" Dolores Umbridge said in a brave attempt at Dolores Umbridge usual mystic tones, though Dolores Umbridge voice shook slightly. \"Divide into pairs, please, and interpret each other's latest nighttime visions with the aid of the Oracle.\" ",
    "Dolores Umbridge made as though to sweep back to Dolores Umbridge seat, saw Dolores Umbridge sitting right beside Dolores Umbridge, and immediately veered left toward Parvati and Lavender, who were already deep in discussion about Parvati's most recent dream. ",
    "Harry opened Harry copy of the Oracle, watching Dolores Umbridge covertly. Dolores Umbridge was making notes on her clipboard now. After a few minutes Dolores Umbridge got to Dolores Umbridge feet and began to pace the room in Dolores Umbridge's wake, listening to Dolores Umbridge conversations with students and posing questions here and there. Harry bent Harry head hurriedly over Harry book. ",
    "\"Think of a dream, quick,\" Harry told Ron, \"in case the old toad comes our way.\" ",
    "\"I did the old toad last time,\" Ron protested, \"it's your turn, you tell me one.\" ",
    "\"Oh, I dunno ...\" said Harry desperately, who could not remember dreaming anything at all over the last few days. \"Let's say I dreamed I was ... drowning Snape in my cauldron. Yeah, that'll do...\" ",
    "Ron chortled as \" ",
    "Ron opened \" ",
    "Ron Dream Oracle. ",
    "\"Okay, we've got to add your age to the date you had the dream, the number of letters in the subject ... would that be 'drowning' or 'cauldron' or 'Snape'?\" ",
    "\"It doesn't matter, pick any of them,\" said Harry, chancing a glance behind Harry. Dolores Umbridge was now standing at Dolores Umbridge's shoulder making notes while the Divination teacher questioned Neville about the Divination teacher . ",
    "\"What night did you dream this again?\" Ron said, immersed in calculations. ",
    "\"I dunno, last night, whenever you like,\" Harry told Ron, trying to listen to what Dolores Umbridge was saying to Dolores Umbridge. They were only a table away from Ron and Ron now. Dolores Umbridge was ",
    "making another note on Dolores Umbridge clipboard and Dolores Umbridge was looking extremely put out. ",
    "\"Now,\" said Dolores Umbridge, looking up at Dolores Umbridge, \"you've been in this post how long, exactly?\" ",
    "Dolores Umbridge scowled at Dolores Umbridge, arms crossed and shoulders hunched as though wishing to protect Dolores Umbridge as much as possible from the indignity of the inspection. After a slight pause in which Dolores Umbridge seemed to decide that the question was not so offensive that Dolores Umbridge could reasonably ignore the question, Dolores Umbridge said in a deeply resentful tone, \"Nearly sixteen years.\" ",
    "\"Quite a period,\" said Dolores Umbridge, making a note on her clipboard. \"So it was Professor Dumbledore who appointed you?\" ",
    "\"That's right,\" said Dolores Umbridge Dolores Umbridge shortly. ",
    "Dolores Umbridge made another note. ",
    "\"And you are a great-great-granddaughter of Dolores Umbridge?\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Dolores Umbridge, holding Dolores Umbridge head a little higher. ",
    "Another note on the clipboard. ",
    "\"But I think -- correct me if I am mistaken -- that you are the first in your family since Cassandra to be possessed of second sight?\" ",
    "\"These things often skip -- er -- three generations,\" said Dolores Umbridge. ",
    "Dolores Umbridge's toadlike smile widened. ",
    "\"Of course,\" Dolores Umbridge said sweetly, making yet another note. \"Well, if you could just predict something for Dolores Umbridge, then?\" ",
    "Dolores Umbridge looked up inquiringly, still smiling. Dolores Umbridge had stiffened as though unable to believe Dolores Umbridge ears. ",
    "\"I don't understand you,\" said Dolores Umbridge, clutching convulsively at the shawl around Dolores Umbridge scrawny neck. ",
    "\"I'd like you to make a prediction for Dolores Umbridge,\" said Dolores Umbridge very clearly. ",
    "Harry and Ron were not the only people watching and listening sneakily from behind Harry and Ron books now; most of the class were staring transfixed at Dolores Umbridge as Dolores Umbridge drew Dolores Umbridge up to Dolores Umbridge full height, Dolores Umbridge beads and bangles clinking. ",
    "\"The Inner Eye does not See upon command!\" Dolores Umbridge said in scandalized tones. ",
    "\"I see,\" said Dolores Umbridge softly, making yet another note on Dolores Umbridge clipboard. ",
    "\"I -- but -- but ... wait\\\" said Dolores Umbridge Dolores Umbridge suddenly, in an attempt at Dolores Umbridge usual ethereal voice, though the mystical effect was ruined somewhat by the way the mystical effect was shaking with anger. \"I ... I think I do see something ... something that concerns you... Why, I sense something . . . something dark . . . some grave peril ...\" ",
    "Dolores Umbridge pointed a shaking finger at Dolores Umbridge who continued to smile blandly at Dolores Umbridge, eyebrows raised. ",
    "\"I am afraid ... I am afraid that you are in grave danger!\" Dolores Umbridge Dolores Umbridge finished dramatically. ",
    "There was a pause. Dolores Umbridge's eyebrows were still raised. ",
    "\"Right,\" Dolores Umbridge said softly, scribbling on Dolores Umbridge clipboard once more. \"Well, if that's really the best you can do ",
    "Dolores Umbridge turned away, leaving Professor Dolores Umbridge standing rooted to the spot, Dolores Umbridge chest heaving. Harry caught Ron's eye and knew that Ron was thinking exactly the same as Ron was: They both knew that Dolores Umbridge was an old fraud, but on the other hand, They both loathed Dolores Umbridge so much that They both felt very much on Dolores Umbridge's side -- until Dolores Umbridge swooped down on They both a few seconds later, that was. ",
    "\"Well?\" Dolores Umbridge said, snapping Dolores Umbridge long fingers under Harry's nose, uncharacteristically brisk. \"Let me see the start you've made on your dream diary, please.\" ",
    "And by the time Dolores Umbridge had interpreted Harry's dreams at the top of Dolores Umbridge voice (all of which, even the ones that involved eating porridge, apparently foretold a gruesome and early death), Harry was feeling much less sympathetic toward Dolores Umbridge. All the while, Dolores Umbridge stood a few feet away, making notes on that clipboard, and when the bell rang Dolores Umbridge descended the silver ladder first so that Dolores Umbridge was waiting for them all when them all reached them all Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson ten minutes later. ",
    "Dolores Umbridge was humming and smiling to Dolores Umbridge when them all entered the shadowy Divination room. Harry and Ron told Hermione, who had been in Arithmancy, exactly what had happened in Divination while they all took out they all copies of Defensive Magical Theory, but before Hermione could  ",
    "ask any questions Dolores Umbridge had called they all to order and silence fell. ",
    "\"Wands away,\" Dolores Umbridge instructed them all smilingly, and those people who had been hopeful enough to take them out sadly returned them to them bags. \"As we finished chapter one last lesson, I would like you all to turn to page nineteen today and commence chapter two, 'Common Defensive Theories and Their Derivation. ' There will be no need to talk.\" ",
    "Still smiling Dolores Umbridge wide, self-satisfied smile, Dolores Umbridge sat down at Dolores Umbridge desk. The class gave an audible sigh as The class turned, as one, to page nineteen. Harry wondered dully whether there were enough chapters in the book to keep them reading through all this year's lessons and was on the point of checking the contents when Harry noticed that Hermione had Hermione hand in the air again. ",
    "Dolores Umbridge had noticed too, and what was more, Dolores Umbridge seemed to have worked out a strategy for just such an eventuality. Instead of trying to pretend Dolores Umbridge had not noticed Hermione, Dolores Umbridge got to her feet and walked around the front row of desks until Instead of trying to pretend she had not noticed Hermione were face-to-face, then Dolores Umbridge bent down and whispered, so that the rest of The class could not hear, \"What is it this time, Miss Granger?\" ",
    "\"I've already read chapter two,\" said Hermione. ",
    "\"Well then, proceed to chapter three.\" ",
    "\"I've read that too. I've read the book.\" ",
    "Dolores Umbridge blinked but recovered Dolores Umbridge poise almost instantly. ",
    "\"Well, then, you should be able to tell me what Slinkhard says about counterjinxes in chapter fifteen.\" ",
    "\"Dolores Umbridge says that counterjinxes are improperly named,\" said Hermione promptly. \"Dolores Umbridge says 'counterjinx' is just a name people give people jinxes when people want to make people sound more acceptable.Dolores Umbridge raised Dolores Umbridge eyebrows, and Harry knew Dolores Umbridge was impressed against Dolores Umbridge will. ",
    "\"But I disagree,\" Hermione continued. ",
    "Professor Umbridge's eyebrows rose a little higher and Dolores Umbridge gaze became distinctly colder. ",
    "\"You disagree?\" ",
    "\"Yes, I do,\" said Hermione, who, unlike Umbridge, was not whispering, but speaking in a clear, carrying voice that had by now attracted the rest of The class's attention. \"Slinkhard doesn't like jinxes, does Slinkhard? But I think they can be very useful when they're used defensively.\" ",
    "\"Oh, you do, do you?\" said Dolores Umbridge, forgetting to whisper and straightening up. \"Well, I'm afraid it is Mr. Slinkhard 's opinion, and not yours, that matters within this classroom, Miss Granger.\" ",
    "\"But -- \" Hermione began. ",
    "\"That is enough,\" said Dolores Umbridge. Dolores Umbridge walked back to the front of The class and stood before them, all the jauntiness Dolores Umbridge had shown at the beginning of the lesson gone. \"Miss Granger, I am going to take five points from Gryffindor House.\" ",
    "There was an outbreak of muttering at this. ",
    "\"What for?\" said Harry angrily. ",
    "\"Don't you get involved!\" Hermione whispered urgently to Harry. ",
    "\"For disrupting The class with pointless interruptions,\" said Dolores Umbridge smoothly. \"I am here to teach you using a Ministry-approved method that does not include inviting students to give students opinions on matters about which students understand very little. Your previous teachers in this subject may have allowed you more license, but as none of Your previous teachers in this subject -- with the possible exception of Professor Quirrell, who did at least appear to have restricted himself to age-appropriate subjects -- would have passed a Ministry inspection -- \" ",
    "\"Yeah, Quirrell was a great teacher,\" said Harry loudly, \"there was just that minor drawback of himself having Lord Voldemort sticking out of the back of himself head.\" ",
    "This pronouncement was followed by one of the loudest silences Harry had ever heard. Then -- ",
    "\"I think another week's detentions would do you some good, Mr. Potter,\" said Umbridge sleekly. ",
    "k k k ",
    "The cut on the back of Harry's hand had barely healed and by the following morning, The cut on the back of Harry's hand was bleeding again. Harry did not complain during the evening's detention; Harry was determined not to give Dolores Umbridge the satisfaction; over and over again Harry wrote I must ",
    "not tell lies and not a sound escaped Harry lips, though The cut on the back of Harry's hand deepened with every letter. ",
    "The very worst part of this second week's worth of detentions was, just as George had predicted, Angelina's reaction. Angelina cornered Harry just as Harry arrived at the Gryffindor table for breakfast on Tuesday and shouted so loudly that Professor McGonagall came sweeping down upon the pair of them from the staff table. ",
    "\"Miss Johnson, how dare you make such a racket in the Great Hall! Five points from Gryffindor!\" ",
    "\"But Professor McGonagall -- Professor McGonagall's gone and landed Professor McGonagall in detention again -- \" ",
    "\"What's this, Mr. Potter?\" said Professor McGonagall sharply, rounding on Harry. \"Detention? From whom?\" ",
    "\"From Dolores Umbridge,\" muttered Harry, not meeting Professor McGonagall's beady, square-framed eyes. ",
    "\"Are you telling me,\" she said, lowering she voice so that the group of curious Ravenclaws behind them could not hear, \"that after the warning I gave you last Monday you lost your temper in Dolores Umbridge class again?\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" Harry muttered, speaking to the floor. ",
    "\"Potter, you must get a grip on yourself! You are heading for serious trouble! Another five points from Gryffindor!\" ",
    "\"But -- what? Professor, no!\" Harry said, furious at this injustice. \"I'm already being punished by she, why do you have to take points as well?\" ",
    "\"Because detentions do not appear to have any effect on you whatsoever!\" said Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall tartly. \"No, not another word of complaint, Mr. Potter! And as for you, \"Miss Johnson, you will confine your shouting matches to the Quidditch pitch in future or risk losing the team Captaincy!\" ",
    "she strode back toward the staff table. Angelina gave Harry a look of deepest disgust and stalked away, upon which Harry flung Harry onto the bench beside Ron, fuming. ",
    "\"she's taken points off Gryffindor because I'm having my hand sliced open every night! How is that fair, how?\" ",
    "\"I know, mate,\" said Ron sympathetically, tipping bacon onto Harry's plate, \"she's bang out of order.\" ",
    "Hermione, however, merely rustled the pages of she Daily Prophet and said nothing. ",
    "\"You think Professor McGonagall was right, do you?\" said Harry angrily to the picture of Cornelius Fudge obscuring Hermione 's face. ",
    "\"I wish she hadn't taken points from you, but I think she's right to warn you not to lose your temper with Dolores Umbridge,\" said Hermione's voice, while Fudge gesticulated forcefully from the front page, clearly giving some kind of speech. ",
    "Harry did not speak to Hermione all through Charms, but when all through Charms entered Transfiguration Harry forgot Harry anger; Professor Umbridge and she clipboard were ",
    "sitting in a corner and the sight of she drove the memory of breakfast right out of his head. ",
    "\"Excellent,\" whispered Ron, as all through Charms sat down in all through Charms usual seats. \"Let's see Dolores Umbridge get what Dolores Umbridge deserves.\" ",
    "Professor McGonagall marched into the room without giving the slightest indication that Dolores Umbridge knew Dolores Umbridge was there. ",
    "\"That will do,\" Dolores Umbridge said and silence fell immediately. \"Mr. Finnigan, kindly come here and hand back the homework -- Miss Brown, please take this box of mice -- don't be silly, girl, they won't hurt you -- and hand one to each student -- \" ",
    "\"Hem, hem,\" said Dolores Umbridge, employing the same silly little cough Dolores Umbridge had used to interrupt Dumbledore on the first night of term. Professor McGonagall ignored Professor McGonagall. Seamus handed back Harry's essay; Harry took it without looking at Harry and saw, to Harry relief, that Harry had managed an A. ",
    "\"Right then, everyone, listen closely -- Dean Thomas, if you do that to the mouse again I shall put you in detention -- most of you have now successfully vanished your snails and even those who were left with a certain amount of shell have the gist of the spell. Today we shall be -- \" ",
    "\"Hem, hem,\" said Dolores Umbridge. ",
    "\"Yes?\" said Professor McGonagall, turning round, Professor McGonagall eyebrows so close together they seemed to form one long, severe line. ",
    "\"I was just wondering, Professor McGonagall, whether you received my note telling you of the date and time of your inspec -- \" ",
    "\"Obviously I received it, or I would have asked you what you are doing in my classroom,\" said Professor McGonagall, turning Professor McGonagall back firmly on Dolores Umbridge. Many of the students exchanged looks of glee. \"As I was saying, today we shall be practicing the altogether more difficult vanishment of mice. Now, the Vanishing Spell -- \" ",
    "\"Hem, hem.\" ",
    "\"I wonder,\" said Professor McGonagall in cold fury, turning on Dolores Umbridge, \"how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me? You see, I do not generally permit people to talk when I am talking.\" ",
    "Dolores Umbridge looked as though Dolores Umbridge had just been slapped in the face. Dolores Umbridge did not speak, but straightened the parchment on Dolores Umbridge clipboard and began scribbling furiously. Looking supremely unconcerned, Professor McGonagall addressed The class once more. ",
    "\"As I was saying, the Vanishing Spell becomes more difficult with the complexity of the animal to be vanished. The snail, as an invertebrate, does not present much of a challenge; the mouse, as a mammal, offers a much greater one. This is not, therefore, magic you can accomplish with your mind on your dinner. So -- you know the incantation, let me see what you can do...\" ",
    "\"How Dolores Umbridge can lecture me about not losing my temper with Dolores Umbridge!\" Harry said to Ron under Ron voice, ",
    "but Harry was grinning; Harry anger with Professor McGonagall had quite evaporated. ",
    "Dolores Umbridge did not follow Professor McGonagall around The class as Professor McGonagall had followed Professor Trelawney; perhaps Professor McGonagall thought that Professor McGonagall would not permit it. Professor McGonagall did, however, take many more notes while Professor McGonagall sat in Professor McGonagall corner, and when Professor McGonagall finally told them all to pack away, rose with a grim expression on Professor McGonagall face. ",
    "\"Well, it's a start,\" said Ron, holding up a long, wriggling mouse tail and dropping it back into the box Lavender was passing around. ",
    "As they filed out of the classroom, Harry saw Dolores Umbridge approach the teacher's desk; Harry nudged Ron, who nudged Hermione in turn, and the three of they deliberately fell back to eavesdrop. ",
    "\"How long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?\" Dolores Umbridge asked. ",
    "\"Thirty-nine years this December,\" said Professor McGonagall brusquely, snapping Professor McGonagall bag shut. ",
    "Dolores Umbridge made a note. ",
    "\"Very well,\" Dolores Umbridge said, \"you will receive the results of your inspection in ten days' time.\" ",
    "\"I can hardly wait,\" said Professor McGonagall in a coldly indifferent voice, and Professor McGonagall strode off toward the door. \"Hurry up, you three,\" Professor McGonagall added, sweeping Harry, Ron, and Hermione before Professor McGonagall. Harry could not help giving Professor McGonagall a faint smile and could have sworn Harry received one in return. ",
    "Harry had thought that the next time Harry would see Dolores Umbridge would be in Harry detention that evening, but Harry was wrong. When they walked down the lawns toward the forest for Care of Magical Creatures, they found Professor McGonagall and Professor McGonagall clipboard waiting for they beside Professor Grubbly-Plank. ",
    "\"You do not usually take this class, is that correct?\" Harry heard Harry ask as they arrived at the trestle table where the group of captive bowtruckles were scrabbling around for wood lice like so many living twigs. ",
    "\"Quite correct,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank, hands behind Harry back and bouncing on the balls of Harry feet. \"I am a substitute teacher standing in for Professor Hagrid.\" ",
    "Harry exchanged uneasy looks with Ron and Hermione. Malfoy was whispering with Crabbe and Goyle; Malfoy would surely love this opportunity to tell tales on Hagrid to a member of the Ministry. ",
    "\"Hmm,\" said Dolores Umbridge, dropping Dolores Umbridge voice, though Harry could still hear Dolores Umbridge quite clearly, \"I wonder -- the headmaster seems strangely reluctant to give me any information on the matter -- can you tell me what is causing Professor Hagrid very extended leave of absence?\" ",
    "Harry saw Malfoy look up eagerly. ",
    "\" 'Fraid I can't,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank breezily. \"Don't know anything more about it than you do. Got an owl from Dumbledore, would I like a couple of weeks teaching work, accepted -- that's as much as I know. Well ... shall I get started then?\" ",
    "\"Yes, please do,\" said Dolores Umbridge, scribbling upon her clipboard. ",
    "Dolores Umbridge took a different tack in this class and wandered among the students, questioning the students on magical creatures. Most people were able to answer well and Harry's spirits lifted somewhat; at least this class was not letting Professor Hagrid down. ",
    "\"Overall,\" said Dolores Umbridge, returning to Professor Grubbly-Plank's side after a lengthy interrogation of Dean Thomas, \"how do you, as a temporary member of staff -- an objective outsider, I suppose you might say -- how do you find Hogwarts? Do you feel you receive enough support from the school management?\" ",
    "\"Oh, yes, Dumbledore's excellent,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank heartily. \"No, I'm very happy with the way things are run, very happy indeed.\" ",
    "Looking politely incredulous, Dolores Umbridge made a tiny note on Dolores Umbridge clipboard and went on, \"And what are you planning to cover with this class this year -- assuming, of course, that Professor Hagrid does not return?\" ",
    "\"Oh, I'll take them through the creatures that most often come up in O.W.L.,\" said Professor McGonagall Grubbly- Plank. \"Not much left to do -- them've studied unicorns and nifflers, I thought them'd cover porlocks and kneazles, make sure them can recognize crups and knarls, you know...\" ",
    "\"Well, you seem to know what you're doing, at any rate,\" said Dolores Umbridge, making a very obvious tick on her clipboard. Harry did not like the emphasis Dolores Umbridge put on \"you\" and liked it even less when Dolores Umbridge put ",
    "Dolores Umbridge next question to Goyle: \"Now, I hear there have been injuries in this class?\" ",
    "Goyle gave a stupid grin. Malfoy hastened to answer the question. ",
    "\"That was me,\" Malfoy said. \"I was slashed by a hippogriff.\" ",
    "\"A hippogriff?\" said Dolores Umbridge, now scribbling frantically. ",
    "\"Only because Dolores Umbridge was too stupid to listen to what Professor Hagrid told Dolores Umbridge to do,\" said Harry angrily. ",
    "Ron and Hermione groaned. Dolores Umbridge turned Dolores Umbridge head slowly in Harry's direction. ",
    "\"Another night's detention, I think,\" Dolores Umbridge said softly. \"Well, thank you very much, Professor Grubbly-Plank, I think that's all I need here. You will be receiving the results of your inspection within ten days.\" ",
    "\"Jolly good,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and Dolores Umbridge set off back across the lawn to the castle. ",
    "ie ie ie ",
    "It was nearly midnight when Harry left Dolores Umbridge's office that night, Harry hand now bleeding so severely that his hand was staining the scarf Harry had wrapped around his hand. Harry expected the common room to be empty when Harry returned, but Ron and Hermione had sat up waiting for Harry. Harry was pleased to see Ron and Hermione, especially as Hermione was disposed to be sympathetic rather than critical. ",
    "\"Here,\" Dolores Umbridge said anxiously, pushing a small bowl of yellow liquid toward Harry, \"soak your hand in that, it's a solution of strained and pickled murtlap tentacles, it should help.\" ",
    "Harry placed Harry bleeding, aching hand into a small bowl of yellow liquid and experienced a wonderful feeling of relief. Crookshanks curled around Harry legs, purring loudly, and then leapt into Harry lap and settled down. ",
    "\"Thanks,\" Harry said gratefully, scratching behind Crookshanks 's ears with his hand. ",
    "\"I still reckon you should complain about this,\" said Ron in a low voice. ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry flatly. ",
    "\"McGonagall would go nuts if \"McGonagall knew -- \" ",
    "\"Yeah, \"McGonagall probably would,\" said Harry. \"And how long d'you reckon it'd take Dolores Umbridge to pass another Decree saying anyone who complains about the High Inquisitor gets sacked immediately?\" ",
    "Ron opened \" ",
    "Ron mouth to retort but nothing came out and after a moment \" ",
    "Ron closed his mouth again in a defeated sort of way. ",
    "\"\"McGonagall's an awful woman,\" said Hermione in a small voice. \"Awful. You know, I was just saying to Ron when you came in ... we've got to do something about \"McGonagall.\" \" ",
    "\"I suggested poison,\" said Ron grimly. ",
    "\"No ... I mean, something about what a dreadful teacher \"McGonagall is, and how we're not going to learn any defense from \"McGonagall at all,\" said Hermione. ",
    "\"Well, what can we do about that?\" said Ron, yawning. \" 'S too late, isn't it? \"McGonagall got the job, \"McGonagall's here to stay, Fudge'll make sure of that.\" ",
    "\"Well,\" said Hermione tentatively. \"You know, I was thinking today...\" \"McGonagall shot a slightly nervous look at Harry and then plunged on, \"I was thinking that -- maybe the time's come when we should just -- just do it we.\" ",
    "\"Do what we?\" said Harry suspiciously, still floating Harry hand in the essence of murtlap tentacles. ",
    "\"Well -- learn Defense Against the Dark Arts we,\" said Hermione. ",
    "\"Come off it,\" groaned Ron. \"You want we to do extra work? D'you realize Harry and I are behind on homework again and it's only the second week?\" ",
    "\"But this is much more important than homework!\" said Hermione. ",
    "Harry and Ron goggled at her. ",
    "\"I didn't think there was anything in the universe more important than homework,\" said Ron. ",
    "\"Don't be silly, of course there is!\" said Hermione, and Harry saw, with an ominous feeling, that Harry face was suddenly alight with the kind of fervor that S.P.E.W. usually inspired in Harry. \"It's about preparing we, like Harry said in Dolores Umbridge's first lesson, for what's waiting out there. It's about making sure we really can defend we. If we don't learn anything for a whole year -- \" ",
    "\"We can't do much by we,\" said Ron in a defeated voice. \"I mean, all right, we can go and look ",
    "jinxes up in the library and try and practice them, I suppose -- \" ",
    "\"No, I agree, we've gone past the stage where we can just learn things out of books,\" said Hermione. \"We need a teacher, a proper one, who can show We how to use the spells and correct We if We're going wrong.\" ",
    "\"If you're talking about Lupin ...\" Harry began. ",
    "\"No, no, I'm not talking about Lupin,\" said Hermione. \"Harry's too busy with the Order and anyway, the most We could see Harry is during Hogsmeade weekends and that's not nearly often enough.\" ",
    "\"Who, then?\" said Harry, frowning at her. ",
    "Hermione heaved a very deep sigh. ",
    "\"Isn't it obvious?\" her said. \"I'm talking about Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\" ",
    "There was a moment's silence. A light night breeze rattled the windowpanes behind Ron and the fire guttered. ",
    "\"About me what?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"I'm talking about you teaching We Defense Against the Dark Artsthe Dark Arts.\" ",
    "Harry stared at her. Then Harry turned to Ron, ready to exchange the exasperated looks they sometimes shared when Hermione elaborated on far-fetched schemes like S.P.E.W. To Harry's consternation, however, Ron did not look exasperated. Ron was frowning slightly, apparently thinking. Then Ron said, \"That's an idea.\" ",
    "\"What's an idea?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"You,\" said Ron. \"Teaching We to do it.\" ",
    "\"But ...\" ",

    "Harry, you're the best in the year at Defense Against the Dark Arts,\" said Hermione. ",
    "\"Me?\" said Harry, now grinning more broadly than ever. \"No I'm not, you've beaten me in every test -- \" ",
    "\"Actually, I haven't,\" said Hermione coolly. \"You beat me in our third year -- the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the subject But I'm not talking about test results, Harry. Look what you've done\\\" ",
    "\"How d'you mean?\" ",
    "\"You know what, I'm not sure I want someone this stupid teaching me,\" Ron said to Hermione, smirking slightly. Ron turned to Harry. \"Let's think,\" Ron said, pulling a face like Goyle concentrating. \"Uh . . . first year -- you saved the Stone from You-Know-Who.\" ",
    "\"But that was luck,\" said Harry, \"that wasn't skill -- \" ",
    "\"Second year,\" ",
    "Ron interrupted, \"you killed the basilisk and destroyed Riddle.\" ",
    "\"Yeah, but if Fawkes hadn't turned up I -- \" ",
    "\"Third year,\" said Ron, louder still, \"you fought off about a hundred dementors at once -- \" ",
    "\"You know that was a fluke, if the Time-Turner hadn't ?? ",
    "\"Last year,\" Ron said, almost shouting now, \"you fought off You-Know-Who again -- \" ",
    "\"Listen to Ron!\" said Harry, almost angrily, because Ron and Hermione were both smirking now. \"Just listen to Ron, all right? It sounds great when you say it like that, but all that stuff was luck -- I didn't know what I was doing half the time, I didn't plan any of it, ",
    "I just did whatever I could think of, and I nearly always had help -- \" ",
    "Ron and Hermione were still smirking and Harry felt Harry temper rise; Harry wasn't even sure why Harry was feeling so angry. ",
    "\"Don't sit there grinning like you know better than I do, I was there, wasn't I?\" Harry said heatedly. \"I know what went on, all right? And I didn't get through any of that because I was brilliant at Defense Against the Dark Arts, I got through it all because -- because help came at the right time, or because I guessed right -- but I just blundered through it all, I didn't have a clue what I was doing -- STOP LAUGHING!\" ",
    "The bowl of murtlap essence fell to the floor and smashed. Harry became aware that Harry was on Harry feet, though Harry couldn't remember standing up. Crookshanks streaked away under a sofa; Ron and Hermione 's smiles had vanished. ",

Harry's detentions with Dolores Umbridge were finally over (Harry doubted whether the words now etched on the back of his hand would ever fade entirely); Ron had had four more Quidditch practices and not been shouted at during the last two; and all three of four more Quidditch practices had managed to vanish four more Quidditch practices mice in Transfiguration (Hermione had actually progressed to vanishing kittens), before the subject was broached again, on a wild, blustery evening at the end of September, when the three of four more Quidditch practices were sitting in the library, looking up potion ingredients for Snape.

    "Harry had given the matter a great deal of thought over the past fortnight. Sometimes it seemed an insane idea, just as it had on the night Hermione had proposed it, but at others, Hermione had found Hermione thinking about the spells that had served Hermione best in Hermione various encounters with Dark creatures and Death Eaters -- found Hermione, in fact, subconsciously planning lessons...

    "\"Well,\" Hermione said slowly, when Hermione could not pretend to find Asiatic anti-venoms interesting much longer, \"yeah, I -- I've thought about it a bit.\" ",
    "\"And?\" said Hermione eagerly. ",
    "\"I dunno,\" said Harry, playing for time. Harry looked up at Ron. ",
    "\"I thought it was a good idea from the start,\" said Ron, who seemed keener to join in this conversation now that Harry was sure that Harry was not going to start shouting again. ",
    "Harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair. ",
    "\"You did listen to what I said about a load of it being luck, didn't you?\" ",
    "\"Yes, Harry,\" said Hermione gently, \"but all the same, there's no point pretending that you're not good at ",

    "\"Just you and Ron, yeah?\" ",
    "\"Well,\" said Hermione, now looking a mite anxious again. \"Well ... now, don't fly off the handle again, Harry, please... But I really think you ought to teach anyone who wants to learn.

    "\"Well, I think you might be surprised how many people would be interested in hearing what you've got to say,\" said Hermione seriously. \"Look,\" Hermione leaned toward me; Ron, who was still watching Hermione with a frown on me face, leaned forward to listen too, \"you know the first weekend in October's a Hogsmeade weekend? How would it be if we tell anyone who's interested to meet we in the village and we can talk it over?\" ",

    "Harry had been looking forward to the weekend trip into Hogsmeade, but there was one thing worrying Harry. Sirius had maintained a stony silence since Harry had appeared in the fire at the beginning of September; Harry knew they had made Harry angry by saying that they did not want Harry to come -- but Harry still worried from time to time that Sirius might throw caution to the winds and turn up anyway. What were they going to do if the great black dog came bounding up the street toward they in Hogsmeade, perhaps under the nose of Draco Malfoy? ",
    "\"Well, you can't blame Harry for wanting to get out and about,\" said Ron, when Harry discussed Harry fears with Harry and Hermione. \"I mean, Harry's been on the run for over two years, hasn't Harry, and I know that can't have been a laugh, but at least Harry was free, ",

    "\"I don't reckon Harry'd be stupid enough to turn up,\" said Ron bracingly. \"Dumbledore'd go mad if Harry did and Sirius listens to Dumbledore even if Harry doesn't like what Harry hears.\" ",

    "\"Right,\" said Harry vaguely, Harry mind still on Sirius. ",
    "\"Don't worry, Harry,\" Hermione said quietly. \"You've got enough on your plate without Sirius too.\" ",
    "Hermione was quite right, of course; Harry was barely keeping up with Harry homework, though Harry was doing much better now that Harry was no longer spending every evening in detention with Dolores Umbridge. Ron was even further behind with Ron work than Harry, because while they both had Quidditch practices twice a week,  ",
    "Ron also had prefect duties. However, Hermione, who was taking more subjects than either of they both had Quidditch practices twice a week,  ",
    "Ron also had prefect duties, had not only finished all Hermione homework but was also finding time to knit more elf clothes. Harry had to admit that Harry was getting better; it was now almost always possible to distinguish between the hats and the socks. ",

    "\"Er -- why was Filch sniffing you?\" asked Ron, as Ron, Harry, and Hermione set off at a brisk pace down the wide drive to the gates. ",
    "\"I suppose Ron was checking for the smell of Dungbombs,\" said Harry with a small laugh. \"I forgot to tell you ...\" ",
    "And Harry recounted the story of sending Harry letter to Sirius and Filch bursting in seconds later, demanding to see his letter. To Ron slight surprise, Hermione found this story highly interesting, much more, indeed, than Ron did Ron. ",

    "\"Malfoy?\" said Hermione, very skeptically. \"Well ... yes ... maybe ...\" ",
    "And she remained deep in thought all the way into the outskirts of Hogsmeade. ",
    "\"Where are we going anyway?\" Harry asked. \"The Three Broomsticks?\" ",
    "\"Oh -- no,\" said Hermione, coming out of she reverie, \"no, it's always packed and really noisy. I've told the others to meet we in the Hog's Head, that other pub, you know the one, it's not on the main road. I think it's a bit ... you know ... dodgy ... but students don't normally go in there, so I don't think we'll be overheard.\" ",
    "students walked down the main street past Zonko's Joke Shop, where students were unsurprised to see Fred, George, and Lee Jordan, past the post office, from which owls issued at regular intervals, and turned up a side street at the top of which stood a small inn. A battered wooden sign hung from a rusty bracket over the door, with a picture upon A battered wooden sign of a wild boar's severed head leaking blood onto the white cloth around A battered wooden sign. A battered wooden sign creaked in the wind as they approached. All three of they hesitated outside the door. ",
    "\"Well, come on,\" said Hermione slightly nervously. Harry led the way inside. ",
    "It was not at all like the Three Broomsticks, whose large bar gave an impression of gleaming warmth and cleanliness. whose large bar comprised one small, dingy, and very dirty room that smelled strongly of something that might have been goats. The bay windows were so encrusted with grime that very little daylight could permeate the room, which was lit instead with the stubs of candles sitting on rough wooden tables. The floor seemed at first glance to be earthy, though as Harry stepped onto The floor Harry realized that there was stone beneath what seemed to be the accumulated filth of centuries. ",
    "Harry remembered Hagrid mentioning this pub in Harry first year: \"Harry get a lot o' funny folk in The Hog's Head,\" Harry had said, explaining how Harry had won a dragons egg from a hooded stranger there. At the time Harry had wondered why Hagrid had not found Hagrid odd that a hooded stranger kept Hagrid face hidden throughout their encounter; now Hagrid saw that keeping your face hidden was something of a fashion in the Hog's Head. There was a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in dirty gray bandages, though a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in dirty gray bandages was still managing to gulp endless glasses of some smoking, fiery substance through a slit over a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in dirty gray bandages mouth. Two figures shrouded in hoods sat at a table in one of The bay windows; Harry might have thought Two figures dementors if Two figures had not been talking in strong Yorkshire accents; in a shadowy corner beside the fireplace sat a witch with a thick, black veil that fell to her toes. Two figures could just see the tip of her nose because the tip of her nose caused the veil to protrude slightly. ",
    "\"I don't know about this, Hermione,\" Harry muttered, as they crossed to the bar. Harry was looking particularly at a witch. \"Has it occurred to Umbridge might be under that?\" ",
    "Hermione cast an appraising eye at the veiled figure. ",
    "\"Umbridge is shorter than that woman,\" that woman said quietly. \"And anyway, even if Umbridge does come in here there's nothing that woman can do to stop us, Harry, because I've double- and triple-checked the school rules. us're not out-of-bounds; I specifically asked Professor Flitwick whether students were allowed to come in the Hog's Head, and Professor Flitwick said yes, but Professor Flitwick advised me strongly to bring us own glasses. And I've looked up everything I can think of about study groups and homework groups and they're definitely allowed. I just don't think it's a good idea if us parade what us're doing.\" ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry dryly, \"especially as it's not exactly a homework group you're planning, is it?\" ",
    "The barman sidled toward them out of a back room. The barman was a grumpy-looking old man with a great deal of long gray hair and beard. The barman was tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to Harry. ",
    "\"What?\" The barman grunted. ",
    "\"Three butterbeers, please,\" said Hermione. ",
    "a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in dirty gray bandages reached beneath the counter and pulled up three very dusty, very dirty bottles, which a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in dirty gray bandages slammed on the bar. ",
    "\"Six Sickles,\" a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in dirty gray bandages said. ",
    "\"I'll get \"Six Sickles,\" said Harry quickly, passing over the silver. The barman's eyes traveled over Harry, resting for a fraction of a second on Harry scar. Then Harry turned away and deposited Harry's money in an ancient wooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to receive Harry's money. Harry, Ron, and Hermione retreated to the farthest table from the bar and sat down, looking around, while a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in dirty gray bandagesrapped the counter with a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in dirty gray bandages knuckles and received another smoking drink from The barman. ",
    "\"You know what?\" Ron murmured, looking over at the bar with enthusiasm. \"We could order anything We liked in here, I bet that bloke would sell We anything, bloke wouldn't care. I've always wanted to try firewhisky ",
    "\"You -- are -- a -- prefect,\" snarled Hermione. ",
    "\"Oh,\" said Ron, the smile fading from Ron face. \"Yeah ",
    "\"So who did you say is supposed to be meeting We?\" Harry asked, wrenching open the rusty top of Harry butterbeer and taking a swig. ",
    "\"Just a couple of people,\" Hermione repeated, checking Hermione watch and then looking anxiously toward the door. \"I told them to be here about now and I'm sure them know where it is -- oh look, this might be them now -- \" ",
    "the door had opened. A thick band of dusty sunlight split the room in two for a moment and then vanished, blocked by the incoming rush of a crowd of people. ",
    "First came Neville with Dean and Lavender, who were closely followed by Parvati and Padma Patil with (Harry's stomach did a back flip) Cho and one of Cho usually giggling girlfriends, then (on Cho own and looking so dreamy that Cho might have walked in by accident) Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet, and Angelina Johnson, Colin and Dennis Creevey, Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hannah Abbott, and a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait down Luna Lovegood back whose name Harry did not know; ",
    "three Ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner, and Terry Boot; Ginny, followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom Harry recognized vaguely as being a member of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team, and bringing up the rear, Fred and George Weasley with Fred and George Weasley friend Lee Jordan, all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonko's merchandise. ",
    "\"A couple of people?\" said Harry hoarsely to Hermione. \"A couple of people ?\" ",
    "\"Yes, well, the idea seemed quite popular,\" said Hermione happily. \"Ron, do you want to pull up some more chairs?\" ",
    "The barman had frozen in the act of wiping out a glass with a rag so filthy a glass looked as though a glass had never been washed. Possibly The barman had never seen the pub so full. ",
    "\"Hi,\" said Fred, reaching the bar first and counting The barman companions quickly. \"Could we have . . . twenty- five butterbeers, please?\" ",
    "The barman glared at The barman for a moment, then, throwing down a rag so filthy it looked as though it had never been washed irritably as though The barman had been interrupted in something very important, The barman started passing up dusty butterbeers from under the bar. ",
    "\"Cheers,\" said Fred, handing them out. \"Cough up, everyone, I haven't got enough gold for all of these...\" ",
    "Harry watched numbly as the large chattering group took the large chattering group beers from Fred and rummaged in the large chattering group robes to find coins. Harry could not imagine what all these people had turned up for until the horrible ",
    "thought occurred to Harry that all these people might be expecting some kind of speech, at which Harry rounded on Hermione. ",
    "\"What have you been telling people?\" Harry said in a low voice. \"What are they expecting?\" ",
    "\"I've told you, they just want to hear what you've got to say,\" said Hermione soothingly; but Harry continued to look at Harry so furiously that Harry added quickly, \"You don't have to do anything yet, I'll speak to they first.\" ",
    "\"Hi, Harry,\" said Neville, beaming and taking a seat opposite Harry. ",
    "Harry tried to smile back, but did not speak; his mouth was exceptionally dry. Cho had just smiled at Harry and sat down on Ron's right. Cho friend, who had curly reddish-blonde hair, did not smile, but gave Harry a thoroughly mistrustful look that told Harry plainly that, given Cho way, Cho would not be here at all. ",
    "In twos and threes the new arrivals settled around Harry, Ron, and Hermione, some looking rather excited, others curious, Luna Lovegood gazing dreamily into space. When everybody had pulled up a chair, the chatter died out. Every eye was upon Harry. ",
    "\"Er,\" said Hermione, Cho voice slightly higher than usual out of nerves. \"Well -- er -- hi.\" ",
    "The group focused The group attention on Cho instead, though eyes continued to dart back regularly to Harry. ",
    "\"Well ... erm ... well, you know why you're here. Erm ... well, Harry had the idea -- I mean\" -- Harry had thrown Cho a sharp look -- \"I had the idea -- that it might be good if people who wanted to study Defense Against the Dark Arts -- and I mean, really study it, you know, not the rubbish that Umbridge is doing with us\" -- (Hermione's voice became suddenly much stronger and more confident) -- \"because nobody could call that Defense Against the Dark Arts\" -- \"Hear, hear,\" said Anthony Goldstein, and Hermione looked heartened -- \"well, I thought it would be good if we, well, took matters into we own hands.\" ",
    "She paused, looked sideways at Harry, and went on, \"And by that I mean learning how to defend we properly, not just theory but the real spells -- \" ",
    "\"You want to pass your Defense Against the Dark Arts too though, I bet?\" said Michael Corner. ",
    "\"Of course I do,\" said Hermione at once. \"But I want more than that, I want to be properly trained in Defense because ... because ...\" She took a great breath and finished, \"Because Lord Voldemort's back.\" ",
    "The reaction was immediate and predictable. Cho's friend shrieked and slopped butterbeer down Cho's friend, Terry Boot gave a kind of involuntary twitch, Padma Patil shuddered, and Neville gave an odd yelp that Padma Patil managed to turn into a cough. All of them, however, looked fixedly, even eagerly, at Harry. ",
    "\"Well ... that's the plan anyway,\" said Hermione. \"If you want to join we, we need to decide how we're going to -- \" ",
    "\"Where's the proof You-Know- Who's back?\" said the blond Hufflepuff player in a rather aggressive voice. ",
    "\"Well, Dumbledore believes it -- \" Hermione began. ",
    "\"You mean, Dumbledore believes Dumbledore,\" said the blond boy, nodding at Harry. ",
    "\"Who are you?\" said Ron rather rudely. ",
    "\"Zacharias Smith,\" said Dumbledore, \"and I think we've got the right to know exactly what makes Dumbledore say You-Know-Who's back.\" ",
    "\"Look,\" said Hermione, intervening swiftly, \"that's really not what this meeting was supposed to be about -- \" ",
    "\"It's okay, Hermione,\" said Harry. ",
    "It had just dawned upon Harry why there were so many people there. Harry felt that Hermione should have seen this coming. Some of these people -- maybe even most of Some of these people -- had turned up in the hope of hearing Harry's story firsthand. ",
    "\"What makes me say You-Know-Who's back?\" Harry asked, looking Zacharias straight in the face. \"I saw Zacharias. But Dumbledore told the whole school what happened last year, and if you didn't believe Zacharias, you don't believe me, and I'm not wasting an afternoon trying to convince anyone.\" ",
    "The whole group seemed to have held The whole group breath while Harry spoke. Harry had the impression that even the barman was listening in. Harry was wiping the same glass with the filthy rag; the same glass was becoming steadily dirtier. ",
    "Zacharias said dismissively, \"All Dumbledore told us last year was that Cedric Diggory got killed by You- Know-Who and that you brought Diggory's body back to Hogwarts. Harry didn't give us details, Harry didn't tell us exactly how Cedric Diggory got murdered, I think us'd all like to know -- \" ",
    "\"If you've come to hear exactly what it looks like when Lord Voldemort murders someone I can't help you,\" Harry said. Harry temper, always so close to the surface these days, was rising again. Harry did not take Harry eyes from Zacharias Smith's aggressive face, determined not to look at Cho. \"I don't want to talk about Cedric Diggory, all right? So if that's what you're here for, you might as well clear out.\" ",
    "Harry cast an angry look in Hermione's direction. This was, Harry felt, all her fault; her had decided to display Harry like some sort of freak and of course they had all turned up to see just how wild Harry story was... But none of they left none of them seats, not even Zacharias Smith, though Harry continued to gaze intently at Harry. ",
    "\"So,\" said Hermione, her voice very high-pitched again. \"So ... like I was saying ... if you want to learn some defense, then we need to work out how we're going to do it, how often we're going to meet, and where we're going to -- \" ",
    "\"Is it true,\" interrupted her with the long plait down her back, looking at Harry, \"that you can produce a Patronus?\" ",
    "There was a murmur of interest around The whole group at this. ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Harry slightly defensively. ",
    "\"A corporeal Patronus?\" ",
    "The phrase stirred something in Harry's memory. ",
    "\"Er -- you don't know Madam Bones, do you?\" Madam Bones asked. ",
    "her smiled. ",
    "\"her's my auntie,\" her said. \"I'm Madam Bones. her told me about your hearing. So -- is it really true? ",
    "You make a stag Patronus?\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Blimey, Harry!\" said Lee, looking deeply impressed. \"I never knew that!\" ",
    "\"Mum told Ron not to spread it around,\" said Fred, grinning at Harry. \"her said you got enough attention as it was.\" ",
    "\"her's not wrong,\" mumbled Harry and a couple of people laughed. The veiled witch sitting alone shifted very slightly in her seat. ",
    "\"And did you kill a basilisk with that sword in Dumbledore's office?\" demanded Terry Boot. \"That's what one of the portraits on the wall told me when I was in there last year...\" ",
    "\"Er -- yeah, I did, yeah,\" said Harry. ",
    "Justin Finch-Fletchley whistled, the Creevey brothers exchanged awestruck looks, and Lavender Brown said \"wow\" softly. Harry was feeling slightly hot around the collar now; Harry was determinedly looking anywhere but at Cho. ",
    "\"And in our first year,\" said Neville to the group at large, \"Neville to the group saved that Sorcerous Stone -- \" ",
    "\"Sorcerer's,\" hissed Hermione. ",
    "\"Yes, that, from You-Know-Who,\" finished Neville. ",
    "Hannah Abbott's eyes were as round as Galleons. ",
    "\"And that's not to mention,\" said Cho (Harry's eyes snapped onto Harry, Harry was looking at Cho (Harry's eyes snapped onto her, smiling; Cho (Harry's eyes snapped onto her stomach did another somersault), \"all the tasks Cho (Harry's eyes snapped onto her had to get through in the Triwizard Tournament last year -- getting past dragons and merpeople and acromantulas and things...\" ",
    "There was a murmur of impressed agreement around the table. ",
    "Harry's insides were squirming. Harry was trying to arrange Harry face so that Harry did not look too pleased with Harry. The fact that Cho had just praised Harry made it much, much harder for Harry to say the thing Harry had sworn to Harry Harry would tell them. ",
    "\"Look,\" Harry said and everyone fell silent at once, \"I ... I don't want to sound like I'm trying to be modest or anything, but ... I had a lot of help with all that stuff...\" ",
    "\"Not with the dragon, you didn't,\" said Michael Corner at once. \"That was a seriously cool bit of flying...\" ",
    "\"Yeah, well -- \" said Harry, feeling it would be churlish to disagree. ",
    "\"And nobody helped you get rid of those dementors this summer,\" said Susan Bones. ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry, \"no, okay, I know I did bits of it without help, but the point I'm trying to make is -- \" ",
    "\"Are you trying to weasel out of showing us any of this stuff?\" said Zacharias Smith's. ",
    "\"Here's an idea,\" said Ron loudly, before Harry could speak, \"why don't you shut your mouth?\" ",
    "Perhaps the word \"weasel\" had affected Ron particularly strongly; in any case, Ron was now looking at Zacharias as though Ron would like nothing better than to thump Zacharias. Zacharias flushed. ",
    "\"Well, us've all turned up to learn from Zacharias, and now Zacharias's telling us Zacharias can't really do any of it,\" Zacharias said. ",
    "\"That's not what Zacharias said,\" snarled Fred Weasley. ",
    "\"Would you like us to clean out your ears for you?\" inquired George, pulling a long and lethal-looking metal instrument from inside one of the Zonko's bags. ",
    "\"Or any part of your body, really, us're not fussy where us stick this,\" said Fred. ",
    "\"Yes, well,\" said Hermione hastily, \"moving on ... the point is, are us agreed us want to take lessons from Harry?\" ",
    "There was a murmur of general agreement. Zacharias folded Zacharias arms and said nothing, though perhaps this was because Zacharias was too busy keeping an eye on the instrument in George's hand. ",
    "\"Right,\" said Hermione, looking relieved that something had at last been settled. \"Well, then, the next question is how often we do it. I really don't think there's any point in meeting less than once a week -- \" ",
    "\"Hang on,\" said Angelina, \"we need to make sure this doesn't clash with we Quidditch practice.\" ",
    "\"No,\" said Cho, \"nor with ours.\" ",
    "\"Nor ours,\" added Zacharias Smith's. ",
    "\"I'm sure we can find a night that suits everyone,\" said Hermione, slightly impatiently, \"but you know, this is rather important, we're talking about learning to defend we against V-Voldemort's Death Eaters -- \" ",
    "\"Well said!\" barked Ernie Macmillan, whom Harry had been expecting to speak long before this. \"Personally I think this is really important, possibly more important than anything else we'll do this year, even with we O.W.L.s coming up!\" ",
    "even with our O.W.L.s coming up looked around impressively, as though waiting for people to cry, \"Surely not!\" When nobody spoke, even with our O.W.L.s coming up went on, \"I, personally, am at a loss to see why the Ministry has foisted such a useless teacher upon we at this critical period. Obviously they are in denial about the return of You-Know-Who, but to give we a teacher who is trying to actively prevent we from using defensive spells -- \" ",
    "\"we think the reason Umbridge doesn't want we trained in Defense Against the Dark Arts,\" said Hermione, \"is that she's got some ... some mad idea that Dumbledore could use the students in the school as a kind of private army. she thinks Dumbledore'd mobilize we against the Ministry.\" ",
    "Nearly everybody looked stunned at this news; everybody except Luna Lovegood, who piped up, ",
    "\"Well, that makes sense. After all, Cornelius Fudge has got Cornelius Fudge own private army.\" ",
    "\"What?\" said Harry, completely thrown by this unexpected piece of information. ",
    "\"Yes, Dumbledore's got an army of heliopaths,\" said Luna solemnly. ",
    "\"No, Dumbledore hasn't,\" snapped Hermione. ",
    "\"Yes, Dumbledore has,\" said Luna. ",
    "\"What are heliopaths?\" asked Neville, looking blank. ",
    "\"They're spirits of fire,\" said Luna, she protuberant eyes widening so that she looked madder than ever. \"Great tall flaming creatures that gallop across the ground burning everything in front of -- \" ",
    "\"They don't exist, Neville,\" said Hermione tartly. ",
    "\"Oh yes They do!\" said Luna angrily. ",
    "\"I'm sorry, but where's the proof of that?\" snapped Hermione. ",
    "\"There are plenty of eyewitness accounts, just because you're so narrow-minded you need to have everything shoved under your nose before you -- \" ",
    "\"Hem, hem,\" said Ginny in such a good imitation of Professor Umbridge that several people looked around in alarm and then laughed. \"Weren't we trying to decide how often we're going to meet and get Defense lessons?\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Hermione at once, \"yes, we were, you're right...\" ",
    "\"Well, once a week sounds cool,\" said Lee Jordan. ",
    "\"As long as -- \" began Angelina. ",
    "\"Yes, yes, we know about the Quidditch,\" said Hermione in a tense voice. \"Well, the other thing to decide is where we're going to meet...\" ",
    "This was rather more difficult; The whole group fell silent. ",
    "\"Library?\" suggested Katie Bell after a few moments. ",
    "\"I can't see Madam Pince being too chuffed with we doing jinxes in \"Library,\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Maybe an unused classroom?\" said Dean. ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Ron, \"McGonagall might let we have hers, hers did when Harry was practicing for the Tri wizard...\" ",
    "But Harry was pretty certain that McGonagall would not be so accommodating this time. For all that Hermione had said about study and homework groups being allowed, Harry had the distinct feeling this one might be considered a lot more rebellious. ",
    "\"Right, well, we'll try to find somewhere,\" said Hermione. \"we'll send a message round to everybody when we've got a time and a place for the first meeting.\" ",
    "hers rummaged in hers bag and produced parchment and a quill, then hesitated, rather as though hers was steeling hers to say something. ",
    "\"I-I think everybody should write their name down, just so we know who was here. But I also think,\" hers took a deep breath, \"that we all ought to agree not to shout about what we all're doing. So if you sign, you're ",
    "agreeing not to tell Umbridge -- or anybody else what we all're up to.\" ",
    "Fred reached out for the parchment and cheerfully put down \" ",
    "Fred signature, but Harry noticed at once that several people looked less than happy at the prospect of putting several people names on the list. ",
    "\"Er ...\" said Zacharias slowly, not taking the parchment. \"Well ... I'm sure Ernie will tell me when the first meeting is.\" ",
    "But Ernie was looking rather hesitant about signing too. Hermione raised her eyebrows at Ernie. ",
    "\"I -- well, we are prefects,\" Ernie burst out. \"And if this list was found ... well, I mean to say ... you said yourself, if Umbridge finds out ...\" ",
    "\"You just said this group was the most important thing you'd do this year,Harry Harry reminded Harry. ",
    "\"I -- yes,\" said Ernie, \"yes, I do believe that, it's just ",
    "\"Ernie, do you really think I'd leave this list lying around?\" said Hermione testily. ",
    "\"No. No, of course not,\" said Ernie, looking slightly less anxious. \"I -- yes, of course I'll sign.\" ",
    "Nobody raised objections after Ernie, though Harry saw Cho's friend give Cho's friend a rather reproachful look before adding Cho's friend name. When the last person -- Zacharias -- had signed, Hermione took the parchment back and slipped the parchment carefully into Cho's friend . There was an odd feeling in this group now. It was as though this group had just signed some kind of contract. ",
    "\"Well, time's ticking on,\" said Fred briskly, getting to Fred feet. \"George, Lee, and I have got items of a sensitive nature to purchase, George, Lee, and I'll be seeing you all later.\" ",
    "In twos and threes the rest of this group took George, Lee, and I leave too. Cho made rather a business of fastening the catch on her bag before leaving, Cho long dark curtain of hair swinging forward to hide Cho face, but Cho's friend stood beside Cho, arms folded, clicking Cho tongue, so that Cho had little choice but to leave with Cho. As Cho's friend ushered Cho through the door, Cho looked back and waved at Harry. ",
    "\"Well, I think that went quite well,\" said Hermione happily, as Cho, Harry, and Ron walked out of the Hog's Head into the bright sunlight a few moments later, Harry and Ron still clutching Harry and Ron bottles of butterbeer. ",
    "\"That Zacharias bloke's a wart,\" said Ron, who was glowering after the figure of Zacharias Smith's just discernible in the distance. ",
    "\"I don't like Zacharias much either,\" admitted Hermione, \"but Zacharias overheard me talking to Ernie and Hannah at the Hufflepuff table and Zacharias seemed really interested in coming, so what could I say? But the more people the better really -- I mean, Michael Corner and Michael Corner friends wouldn't have come if Michael Corner hadn't been going out with Ginny -- \" ",
    "Ron, who had been draining the last few drops from Michael Corner butterbeer bottle, gagged and sprayed butterbeer down Michael Corner front. ",
    "\"Michael Corner's WHAT?\" said Ron, outraged, Ron ears now resembling curls of raw beef. \"Ginny's going out with -- ",
    "my sister's going -- what d'you mean, Michael Corner?\" ",
    "\"Well, that's why Michael Corner and his friends came, I think -- well, he and his friends're obviously interested in learning defense, but if Ginny hadn't told Michael Corner what was going on -- ",
    "\"When did this -- when did Ginny -- ?\" ",
    "\"They met at the Yule Ball and They got together at the end of last year,\" said Hermione composedly. They had turned into the High Street and Ginny paused outside Scrivenshaft's Quill Shop, where there was a handsome display of pheasant-feather quills in the window. \"Hmm ... I could do with a new quill.\" ",
    "Ginny turned into Scrivenshaft's Quill Shop, where there was a handsome display of pheasant-feather quills in the window. Harry and Ron followed Ginny. ",
    "\"Which one was Michael Corner?\" Ron demanded furiously. ",
    "\"The dark one,\" said Hermione. ",
    "\"I didn't like The dark one,\" said Ron at once. ",
    "\"Big surprise,\" said Hermione under Ginny breath. ",
    "\"But,\" said Ron, following Hermione along a row of quills in copper pots, \"I thought Ginny fancied Harry!\" ",
    "Hermione looked at Harry rather pityingly and shook the Hog's Head. ",
    "Ginny Ginny used to HarryHarry, but Ginny gave up on Harry months ago. Not that Ginny doesn't like you, of course,\" Ginny added kindly to Harry while Ginny examined a long black-and-gold quill. ",
    "Harry, whose head was still full of Cho's parting wave, did not find this subject quite as interesting as Ron, who was positively quivering with indignation, but this subject did bring something home to Harry that until now Harry had not really registered. ",
    "\"So that's why Ginny talks now?\" Harry asked Hermione. \"Ginny never used to talk in front of Harry.\" ",
    "\"Exactly,\" said Hermione. \"Yes, I think I'll have this one...\" ",
    "Ginny went up to the counter and handed over fifteen Sickles and two Knuts, Ron still breathing down Ginny neck. ",
    "\"Ron,\" Ginny said severely as Ginny turned and trod on his feet, \"this is exactly why Ginny hasn't told you Ginny's seeing Michael Corner, Ginny knew you'd take it badly. So don't harp on about it, for heaven's sake.\" ",
    "\"What d'you mean, who's taking anything badly? I'm not going to harp on about anything ...\" ",
    "Ron continued to chunter under \" ",
    "Ron breath all the way down the street. Hermione rolled Ginny eyes at Harry and then said in an undertone, while Ron was muttering imprecations about Michael Corner, \"And talking about Michael Corner and Ginny . . . what about Cho and you?\" ",
    "\"What d'you mean?\" said Harry quickly. ",
    "It was as though boiling water was rising rapidly inside Harry; a burning sensation that was causing Harry face to smart in the cold -- had Harry been that obvious? ",
    "\"Well,\" said Hermione, smiling slightly, \"Cho just couldn't keep her eyes off you, could Cho?\" ",
    "Harry had never before appreciated just how beautiful the village of Hogsmeade was. "

  "EDUCATIONAL DECREE NUMBER TWENTY-FOUR": [
    "Harry felt happier for the rest of the weekend than Harry had done all term. Michael and Ginny spent much of Sunday catching up with all Michael and Ginny homework again, and although this could hardly be called fun, the last burst of autumn sunshine persisted, so rather than sitting hunched over tables in the common room, Michael and Ginny took Michael and Ginny work outside and lounged in the shade of a large beech tree on the edge of the lake. Hermione, who of course was up to date with all her work, brought more wool outside with her and bewitched her knitting needles so that Michael and Ginny flashed and clicked in midair beside her, producing more hats and scarves. ",
    "The knowledge that Michael and Ginny were doing something to resist Umbridge and the Ministry, and that he was a key part of the rebellion, gave Harry a feeling of immense satisfaction. Harry kept reliving Saturday's meeting in Harry mind: all those people, coming to Harry to learn Defense Against the Dark Arts . . . and the looks on all those people, coming to him to learn Defense Against the Dark Arts faces as all those people, coming to him to learn Defense Against the Dark Arts had heard some of the ",
    "things Harry had done . . . and Cho praising Harry performance in the Triwizard Tournament... The knowledge that all those people did not think Harry a lying weirdo, but someone to be admired, buoyed Harry up so much that Harry was still cheerful on Monday morning, despite the imminent prospect of all Harry least favorite classes. ",
    "Michael and Ginny headed downstairs from Michael and Ginny dormitory together, discussing Angelina's idea that Michael and Ginny were to work on a new move called the Sloth Grip Roll during that night's Quidditch practice, and not until Michael and Ginny were halfway across the sunlit common room did Michael and Ginny notice the addition to the room that had already attracted the attention of a small group of people.

    "A large sign had been affixed to the Gryffindor notice board, so large that the Gryffindor notice board covered everything else on there -- the lists of secondhand spellbooks for sale, the regular reminders of school rules from Argus Filch, the Quidditch team training schedule, the offers to barter certain Chocolate Frog cards for others, the Weasleys' new advertisement for testers, the dates of the Hogsmeade weekends, and the lost-and-found notices.

    "Harry and Ron read the notice over the heads of some anxious-looking second years. ",
    "\"Does this mean Harry and Ron're going to shut down Club?\" one of Harry and Ron asked his friend. ",
    "\"I reckon you'll be okay with Gobstones,\" ",
    "Ron said darkly, making the second year jump. \"I don't think we're going to be as lucky, though, do you?\" \" ",
    "Ron asked Harry as the second years hurried away. ",
    "Harry was reading the notice through again. The happiness that had filled Harry since Saturday was gone. Harry insides were pulsing with rage. ",
    "\"This isn't a coincidence,\" Harry said, Harry hands forming fists. \"She knows.\" ",
    "\"She can't,\" said Ron at once. ",
    "\"There were people listening in that pub. And let's face it, we don't know how many of the people who turned up we can trust... Any of the people who turned up could have run off and told Umbridge...\" ",
    "And he had thought the people who turned up believed he, thought the people who turned up even admired he . . . ",
    "\"Zacharias Smith!\" said Ron at once, punching a fist into Ron hand. \"Or -- I thought that Michael Corner had a really shifty look too -- \" ",
    "\"I wonder if Hermione's seen this yet?\" Harry said, looking around at the door to the girls' dormitories. ",
    "\"Let's go and tell her,\" said Ron. Ron bounded forward, pulled open the door to the girls' dormitories, and set off up the spiral staircase. ",
    "Ron was on the sixth stair when it happened. There was a loud, wailing, klaxonlike sound and the steps melted together to make a long, smooth stone slide. There was a brief moment when Ron tried to keep running, arms working madly like windmills, then Ron toppled over backward and shot down the newly created slide, coming to rest on Ron back at Harry's feet. ",
    "\"Er -- I don't think we're allowed in the girls' dormitories,\" said Harry, pulling Ron to Harry's feet and trying not to laugh. ",
    "Two fourth-year girls came zooming gleefully down the newly created slide. ",
    "\"Oooh, who tried to get upstairs?\" Two fourth-year girls giggled happily, leaping to Two fourth-year girls and ogling Harry and Ron. ",
    "\"Me,\" said Ron, who was still rather disheveled. \"I didn't realize that would happen. It's not fair!\" Harry added to Harry, as Two fourth-year girls headed off for the portrait hole, still giggling madly. \"Hermione's allowed in our dormitory, how come our're not allowed -- ?\" ",
    "\"Well, it's an old-fashioned rule,\" said Hermione, who had just slid neatly onto a rug in front of them and was now getting to Harry's feet, \"but it says in Hogwarts, A History that the founders thought boys were less trustworthy than girls. Anyway, why were you trying to get in there?\" ",
    "\"To see you -- look at this!\" said Ron, dragging her over to the notice board. ",
    "Hermione's eyes slid rapidly down the notice board. her expression became stony. ",
    "\"Someone must have blabbed to her!\" Ron said angrily. ",
    "\"They can't have done,\" said Hermione in a low voice. ",
    "\"You're so naive,\" said Ron, \"you think just because you're all honorable and trustworthy -- \" ",
    "\"No, They can't have done because I put a jinx on that piece of parchment we all signed,\" said Hermione grimly. \"Believe me, if anyone's run off and told Umbridge, well know exactly who anyone are and anyone will really regret it.\" ",
    "\"What'll happen to anyone?\" said Ron eagerly. ",
    "\"Well, put it this way,\" said Hermione, \"it'll make Eloise Midgen's acne look like a couple of cute freckles. Come on, let's get down to breakfast and see what the others think. . . I wonder whether this has been put up in all the Houses?\" ",
    "this has been put up in all the Houses was immediately apparent on entering the Great Hall that Umbridge's sign had not only appeared in Gryffindor Tower. There was a peculiar intensity about the chatter and an extra measure of movement in the Great Hall as people scurried up and down people tables conferring on what people had read. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had barely taken Harry, Ron, and Hermione seats when Neville, Dean, Fred, George, and Ginny descended upon Harry, Ron, and Hermione. ",
    "\"Did you see it?\" ",
    "\"D'you reckon she knows?\" ",
    "\"What are we going to do?\" ",
    "Harry, Ron, and Hermione were all looking at Harry. Harry glanced around to make sure there were no teachers near Harry, Ron, and Hermione. ",
    "\"we're going to do it anyway, of course,\" Harry said quietly. ",
    "\"Knew you'd say that,\" said George, beaming and thumping Harry on the arm. ",
    "\"The prefects as well?\" said Fred, looking quizzically at Ron and Hermione. ",
    "\"Of course,\" said Hermione coolly. ",
    "\"Here comes Ernie and Hannah Abbott,\" said Ron, looking over Ron shoulder. \"And those Ravenclaw blokes and Smith ... and no one looks very spotty.\" ",
    "Hermione looked alarmed. ",
    "\"Never mind spots, the idiots can't come over here now, it'll look really suspicious -- sit down!\" Hermione mouthed to Ernie, gesturing frantically to Ernie to rejoin the Hufflepuff table. \"Later! we'll -- talk -- to -- you -- lateri\" ",
    "\"I'll tell Michael Corner,\" said Ginny impatiently, swinging Ginny off Ginny bench. \"The fool, honestly ...\" ",
    "Ginny hurried off toward the Hufflepuff table; Harry watched Ginny go. Cho was sitting not far away, talking to the curly-haired friend Cho had brought along to the Hog's Head. Would Umbridge's notice scare Cho off meeting Umbridge's notice again? ",
    "But the full repercussions of the sign were not felt until Umbridge's notice were leaving the Great Hall for History of Magic. ",
    "\"Harry! Ron\\\" ",
    "It was Angelina and Angelina was hurrying toward them looking perfectly desperate. ",
    "\"It's okay,\" said Harry quietly, when Angelina was near enough to hear Harry. \"We're still going to -- \" ",
    "\"You realize Angelina's including Quidditch in this?\" Angelina said over him. \"We have to go and ask permission to re-form the Gryffindor team!\" ",
    "\"What?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"No way,\" said Ron, appalled. ",
    "\"You read the sign, the sign mentions teams too! So listen, Harry ... I am saying this for the last time... Please, please don't lose your temper with Umbridge again or Umbridge might not let We play anymore!\" ",
    "\"Okay, okay,\" said Harry, for Angelina looked as though Angelina was on the verge of tears. \"Don't worry, I'll behave myself...\" ",
    "\"Umbridge is in History of Magic,\" said Ron grimly, as they set off for Binns's lesson. \"Angelina hasn't inspected Binns yet... Bet you anything Angelina's there...\" ",
    "But Binns was wrong; the only teacher present when they entered was Binns, floating an inch or so above Binns chair as usual and preparing to continue Binns monotonous drone on giant wars. Harry did not even attempt to follow what Harry was saying today; Harry doodled idly on Harry parchment ignoring Hermione's frequent glares and nudges, until a particularly painful poke in the ribs made Harry look up angrily. ",
    "\"What?\" ",
    "Angelina pointed at the window. Harry looked around. Hedwig was perched on the narrow window ledge, gazing through the thick glass at Harry, a letter tied to Hedwig leg. Harry could not understand it; they had just had breakfast, why on earth hadn't Angelina delivered a letter tied to her leg then, as usual? Many of Harry classmates were pointing out Hedwig to each other too. ",
    "\"Oh, I've always loved that owl, Angelina's so beautiful,Harry heard Lavender sigh to Parvati. ",
    "Harry glanced around at Professor Binns who continued to read Harry notes, serenely unaware that the class's attention was even less focused upon Harry than usual. Harry slipped quietly off his chair, crouched down, and hurried along the row to the window, where Harry slid the catch and opened his chair very slowly. ",
    "Harry had expected Hedwig to hold out her leg so that Harry could remove a letter tied to her leg and then fly off to the Owlery, but the moment the window was open wide enough Hedwig hopped inside, hooting dolefully. Harry closed the window with an anxious glance at Binns, crouched low again, and sped back to Harry seat with Hedwig on his shoulder. Harry regained his seat with Hedwig, transferred Hedwig to Harry lap, and made to remove the letter tied to her leg. ",
    "It was only then that Harry realized that Hedwig's feathers were oddly ruffled; some were bent the wrong way, and Hedwig was holding one of Hedwig wings at an odd angle. ",
    "\"Hedwig's hurt!\" Harry whispered, bending Harry head low over Hedwig. Hermione and Ron leaned in closer; Hermione even put down Hedwig quill. \"Look -- there's something wrong with Hedwig wing -- \" ",
    "Hedwig was quivering; when Harry made to touch the wing Hedwig gave a little jump, all Hedwig feathers on end as though Hedwig was inflating Hedwig, and gazed at Harry reproachfully. ",
    "Binns,\" said Harry loudly, and everyone in the class turned to look at Harry. \"I'm not feeling well.\" ",
    "Binns raised Binns eyes from Binns notes, looking amazed, as always, to find the room in front of Binns full of people. ",
    "\"Not feeling well?\" Binns repeated hazily. ",
    "\"Not at all well,\" said Harry firmly, getting to Harry's feet while concealing Hedwig behind Harry back. \"So I think I'll need to go to her wing.\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Professor Binns, clearly very much wrong- footed. \"Yes ... yes, hospital wing ... well, off you go, then, Perkins ...\" ",
    "Once outside the room Harry returned Hedwig to his shoulder and hurried off up the corridor, pausing to think only when Harry was out of sight of Binns's door. Harry first choice of somebody to cure Hedwig would have been Hagrid, of course, but as Harry had no idea where Hagrid was, Harry only remaining option was to find Professor Grubbly-Plank and hope Professor Grubbly-Plank would help. ",
    "Harry peered out of a window at the blustery, overcast grounds. There was no sign of Professor Grubbly-Plank anywhere near Hagrid's cabin; if Professor Grubbly-Plank was not teaching, Professor Grubbly-Plank was probably in the staffroom. Harry set off downstairs, Hedwig hooting feebly as Professor Grubbly-Plank swayed on his shoulder. ",
    "Two stone gargoyles flanked the staffroom door. As Harry approached, one of Two stone gargoyles croaked, \"You should be in class, sunny Jim.\" ",
    "\"This is urgent,\" said Harry curtly. ",
    "\"Ooooh, urgent, is it?\" said the other gargoyle in a high-pitched voice. \"Well, that's put us in us place, hasn't it?\" ",
    "Harry knocked; Harry heard footsteps and then the staffroom door opened and Harry found Harry face-to-face with Professor McGonagall. ",
    "\"You haven't been given another detention!\" Professor Grubbly-Plank said at once, Professor Grubbly-Plank square spectacles flashing alarmingly. ",
    "\"No, Binns!\" said Harry hastily. ",
    "\"Well then, why are you out of class?\" ",
    "\"It's urgent, apparently,\" said the second gargoyle snidely. ",
    "\"I'm looking for Professor Grubbly-Plank,Harry Harry explained. \"It's my owl, Professor Grubbly-Plank's injured.\" ",
    "\"Injured owl, did you say?\" ",
    "Professor Grubbly-Plank appeared at Professor McGonagall's shoulder, smoking a pipe and holding a copy of the Daily Prophet ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Harry, lifting Hedwig carefully off Professor McGonagall's shoulder, \"Professor Grubbly-Plank turned up after the other post owls and Professor Grubbly-Plank wing's all funny, look -- \" ",
    "Professor Grubbly-Plank stuck Professor Grubbly-Plank pipe firmly between Professor Grubbly-Plank teeth and took Hedwig from Harry while Professor McGonagall watched. ",
    "\"Hmm,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank, Professor Grubbly-Plank pipe waggling slightly as Professor Grubbly-Plank talked. \"Looks like something's attacked Professor Grubbly-Plank. Can't think what would have done it, though... Thestrals will sometimes go for birds, of course, but Hagrid's got Thestrals well trained not to touch owls ...\" ",
    "Harry neither knew nor cared what Thestrals were, Harry just wanted to know that Hedwig was going to be all right. Professor McGonagall, however, looked sharply at Harry and said, \"Do you know how far \"Injured owl's traveled, Potter?\" ",
    "\"Er,\" said Harry. \"From London, I think.\" ",
    "Harry met Professor Grubbly-Plank eyes briefly and knew that Professor Grubbly-Plank understood \"London\" to mean \"number twelve, Grimmauld Place\" by the way Professor Grubbly-Plank eyebrows had joined in the middle. ",
    "Professor Grubbly-Plank pulled a monocle out of the inside of Professor Grubbly-Plank robes and screwed a monocle into Professor Grubbly-Plank eye to examine Hedwig's wing closely. \"I should be able to sort this out if you leave Professor Grubbly-Plank with me, Potter,\" Professor Grubbly-Plank said. \"Professor Grubbly-Plank shouldn't be flying long distances for a few days, in any case.\" ",
    "\"Er -- right -- thanks,\" said Harry, just as the bell rang for break. ",
    "\"No problem,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank gruffly, turning back into the staffroom. ",
    "\"Just a moment, Wilhelmina!\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Potter's letter!\" ",
    "\"Oh yeah!\" said Harry, who had momentarily forgotten the scroll tied to Hedwig leg. Professor Grubbly-Plank handed it over and then disappeared into the staffroom carrying Hedwig, who was staring at Harry as though unable to believe Harry would give Professor Grubbly-Plank away like this. Feeling slightly guilty, Harry turned to go, but Professor McGonagall called Harry back. ",
    "\"Potter!\" ",
    "\"Yes, Binns?\" ",
    "Professor Grubbly-Plank glanced up and down the corridor; there were students coming from both directions. ",
    "\"Bear in mind,\" Professor Grubbly-Plank said quickly and quietly, Professor Grubbly-Plank eyes on the scroll in Harry hand, \"that channels of communication in and out of Hogwarts may be being watched, won't you?\" ",
    "\"I -- \" said Harry, but the flood of students rolling along the corridor was almost upon Harry. Professor McGonagall gave Professor McGonagall a curt nod and retreated into the staffroom, leaving Harry to be swept out into the courtyard with the crowd. Here Harry spotted Ron and Hermione already standing in a sheltered corner, Ron and Hermione cloak collars turned up against the wind. Harry slit open the scroll as Harry hurried toward Ron and Hermione and found five words in Sirius's handwriting: ",
    "Today, same time, same place. ",
    "\"Is Hedwig okay?\" asked Hermione anxiously, the moment Harry was within earshot. ",
    "\"Where did you take Hermione?\" asked Ron. ",
    "\"To Grubbly-Plank,\" said Harry. \"And I met Professor McGonagall... Listen...\" ",
    "And Ron told Ron and Hermione what Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall had said. To Ron surprise, neither of the others looked shocked; on the contrary, Ron and Hermione exchanged significant looks. ",
    "\"What?\" said Harry, looking from Ron to Hermione and back again. ",
    "\"Well, I was just saying to Ron ... what if someone had tried to intercept Hedwig? I mean, Hedwig's never been hurt on a flight before, has Hedwig?\" ",
    "\"Who's the letter from anyway?\" asked Ron, taking the note from Harry. ",
    "\"Snuffles,\" said Harry quietly. ",
    "\" 'Same time, same place'? Does Ron mean the fire in the common room?\" ",
    "\"Obviously,\" said Hermione, also reading the note. ",
    "Hedwig looked uneasy. \"I just hope nobody else has read this...\" ",
    "\"But this was still sealed and everything,\" said Harry, trying to convince Harry as much as Hedwig. \"And nobody would understand what this meant if they didn't know where we'd spoken to Harry before, would they?\" ",
    "\"I don't know,\" said Hermione anxiously, hitching Hedwig bag back over Hedwig shoulder as the bell rang again. \"It wouldn't be exactly difficult to reseal the scroll by magic... And if anyone's watching the Floo Network ... but I don't really see how we can warn Ron not to come without that being intercepted too!\" ",
    "the Floo Network trudged down the stone steps to the dungeons for Potions, all three of the Floo Network lost in thought, but as the Floo Network reached the bottom of the stairs the Floo Network were recalled to the Floo Network by the voice of Draco Malfoy, who was standing just outside Snape's classroom door, waving around an official-looking piece of parchment and talking much louder than was necessary so that the Floo Network could hear every word. ",
    "\"Yeah, Umbridge gave the Slytherin Quidditch team permission to continue playing straightaway, I went to ask Umbridge first thing this morning. Well, it was pretty much automatic, I mean, Umbridge knows my father really well, my father's always popping in and out of the Ministry... ",
    "It'll be interesting to see whether Gryffindor are allowed to keep playing, wont Gryffindor?\" ",
    "\"Don't rise,\" Hermione whispered imploringly to Harry and Ron, who were both watching Malfoy, faces set and fists clenched. \"It's what my father wants...\" ",
    "\"I mean,\" said Malfoy, raising my father voice a little more, my father gray eyes glittering malevolently in Harry and Ron's direction, \"if it's a question of influence with the Ministry, I don't think the Ministry've got much chance... ",
    "From what my father says, the Ministry've been looking for an excuse to sack Arthur Weasley for years... And as for Potter ... my father says it's a matter of time before the Ministry has my father carted off to St. Mungo's... apparently the Ministry've got a special ward for people whose brains have been addled by magic...\" ",
    "Malfoy made a grotesque face, my father mouth sagging open and my father eyes rolling. Crabbe and Goyle gave Crabbe and Goyle usual grunts of laughter, Pansy Parkinson shrieked with glee. ",
    "Something collided hard with Harry's shoulder, knocking Pansy Parkinson sideways. A split second later Pansy Parkinson realized that Neville had just charged past Pansy Parkinson, heading straight for Malfoy. ",
    "\"Neville, no!\" ",
    "Harry leapt forward and seized the back of Neville's robes; Neville struggled frantically, \" ",
    "Harry fists flailing, trying desperately to get at \" ",
    "Malfoy who looked, for a moment, extremely shocked. ",
    "\"Help me!\" Harry flung at Ron, managing to get an arm around Neville's neck and dragging Neville backward, away from the Slytherins. Crabbe and Goyle were now flexing Crabbe and Goyle arms, closing in front of \" ",
    "Malfoy, ready for the fight. Ron hurried forward and seized Neville's arms; together, Ron and Harry succeeded in dragging Neville back into the Gryffindor line. Neville's face was scarlet; the pressure Harry was exerting on Harry throat rendered Harry quite incomprehensible, but odd words spluttered from Harry mouth. ",
    "\"Not... funny ... don't ... St. Mungo's's ... show ... him ...\" ",
    "the staffroom door opened. Snape appeared there. Snape black eyes swept up the Gryffindor line to the point where Harry and Ron were wrestling with Neville. ",
    "\"Fighting, Potter, Weasley, Longbottom?\" Snape said in Snape cold, sneering voice. \"Ten points from Gryffindor. Release Longbottom, Potter ..., or it will be detention. Inside, all of you.\" ",
    "Harry let go of Neville, who stood panting and glaring at Harry. ",
    "\"I had to stop you,Harry Harry gasped, picking up Harry bag. \"Crabbe and Goyle would've torn you apart.\" ",
    "Neville said nothing, Neville merely snatched up Neville own bag and stalked off into the dungeon. ",
    "\"What in the name of Merlin,\" said Ron slowly, as they followed Neville, \"was that about?\" ",
    "Harry did not answer. Harry knew exactly why the subject of people who were in St. Mungo's because of magical damage to people who were in St. Mungo's because of magical damage to their brains brains was highly distressing to Neville, but Harry had sworn to Dumbledore that Harry would not tell anyone Neville's secret. Neville Neville did not know that Harry knew. ",
    "Harry, Ron, and Hermione took Harry, Ron, and Hermione usual seats at the back of the class and pulled out parchment, quills, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione copies of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi. the class was whispering about what Neville had just done, but when Snape closed the staffroom door with an echoing bang everybody fell silent immediately. ",
    "\"You will notice,\" said Snape in Snape low, sneering voice, \"that we have a guest with we today.\" ",
    "Snape gestured toward the dim corner of the dungeon, and Harry saw Umbridge sitting there, clipboard on Umbridge knee. Snape glanced sideways at Ron and Hermione, Snape eyebrows raised. Snape and Umbridge, the two teachers Snape hated most ... it was hard to decide which Snape wanted to triumph over the other. ",
    "\"we are continuing with we Strengthening Solutions today, you will find your mixtures as you left your mixtures last lesson, if correctly made your mixtures should have matured well over the weekend -- instructions\" -- Snape waved Snape wand again -- \"on the board. Carry on.Umbridge spent the first half hour of the lesson making notes in Umbridge corner. Harry was very interested in hearing Umbridge question Snape, so interested, that Harry was becoming careless with Harry potion again. ",
    "\"Salamander blood, Harry!\" Hermione moaned, grabbing Hermione wrist to prevent Hermione adding the wrong ingredient for the third time. \"Not pomegranate juice!\" ",
    "\"Right,\" said Harry vaguely, putting down the bottle and continuing to watch her corner. Umbridge had just gotten to Umbridge feet. \"Ha,\" Hermione said softly, as Umbridge ",
    "strode between two lines of desks toward Snape, who was bending over Dean Thomas's cauldron. ",
    "\"Well, the class seems fairly advanced for the class level,\" Umbridge said briskly to Snape 's back. \"Though I would question whether it is advisable to teach the class a potion like the Strengthening Solution. I think the Ministry would prefer the Ministry if that was removed from the syllabus.\" ",
    "Snape straightened up slowly and turned to look at Snape. ",
    "\"Now ... how long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?\" Snape asked, Snape quill poised over Snape clipboard. ",
    "\"Fourteen years,\" Snape replied. Snape expression was unfathomable. Snape eyes on Snape, Harry added a few drops to Harry potion; it hissed menacingly and turned from turquoise to orange. ",
    "\"You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, I believe?\" Umbridge asked Snape. ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Snape quietly. ",
    "\"But you were unsuccessful?\" ",
    "Snape 's lip curled. ",
    "\"Obviously.Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard. ",
    "\"And you have applied regularly for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post the Dark Arts post since you first joined the school, I believe?\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Snape quietly, barely moving Snape lips. Snape looked very angry. ",
    "\"Do you have any idea why Dumbledore has consistently refused to appoint you?\" asked Umbridge. ",
    "\"I suggest you ask Snape,\" said Snape jerkily. ",
    "\"Oh I shall,\" said Umbridge with a sweet smile. ",
    "\"I suppose this is relevant?\" Snape asked, His eyes on Snape narrowed. ",
    "\"Oh yes,\" said Umbridge. \"Yes, the Ministry wants a thorough understanding of teachers' -- er -- backgrounds...\" ",
    "She turned away, walked over to Pansy Parkinson and began questioning She about the lessons. Snape looked around at Harry and His eyes on Snape met for a second. Harry hastily dropped Harry gaze to Harry potion, which was now congealing foully and giving off a strong smell of burned rubber. ",
    "\"No marks again, then, Potter ...,\" said Snape maliciously, emptying Harry's cauldron with a wave of his wand. \"You will write me an essay on the correct composition of this potion, indicating how and why you went wrong, to be handed in next lesson, do you understand?\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Harry furiously. Snape had already given them homework, and Snape had Quidditch practice this evening; this would mean another couple of sleepless nights. this did not seem possible that Snape had awoken that morning feeling very happy. All Snape felt now was a fervent desire for this day to end as soon as possible.  ",
    "\"Maybe I'll skive off Divination,\" Snape said glumly as they stood again in the courtyard after lunch, the wind whipping at the hems of robes and brims of hats. \"I'll pretend to be ill and do Snape's essay instead, then I won't have to stay up half the night...\" ",
    "\"You can't skive off Divination,\" said Hermione severely. ",
    "\"Hark who's talking, you walked out of Divination, you hate Trelawney!\" said Ron indignantly. ",
    "\"I don't hate \"Hark who's talking,\" said Hermione loftily. \"I just think \"Hark who's talking's an absolutely appalling teacher and a real old fraud... But Harry's already missed History of Magic and I don't think Harry ought to miss anything else today!\" ",
    "There was too much truth in this to ignore, so half an hour later Harry took Harry seat in the hot, over- perfumed atmosphere of the Divination classroom feeling angry at everybody. Trelawney was handing out copies of The Dream Oracle yet again; Trelawney would surely be much better employed doing Snape's punishment essay than sitting here trying to find meaning in a lot of made-up dreams. ",
    "It seemed, however, that Trelawney was not the only person in Divination who was in a temper. Trelawney slammed a copy of The Dream Oracle down on the table between Harry and Ron and swept away, \"Hark who's talking lips pursed; \"Hark who's talking threw the next copy of the Oracle at Seamus and Dean, narrowly avoiding Seamus's head, and thrust the final one into Neville's chest with such force that Trelawney slipped off Trelawney pouf. ",
    "\"Well, carry on!\" said Trelawney Trelawney loudly, Trelawney voice high pitched and somewhat hysterical. \"You ",
    "know what to do! Or am I such a substandard teacher that you have never learned how to open a book?\" ",
    "The class stared perplexedly at Trelawney and then at each other. Harry, however, thought Harry knew what was the matter. As Trelawney flounced back to the high-backed teacher's chair, Trelawney magnified eyes full of angry tears, Harry leaned Seamus's head closer to Ron's and muttered, \"I think Trelawney's got the results of Trelawney inspection back.\" ",
    "\"Professor?\" said Parvati Patil in a hushed voice (Trelawney and Lavender had always rather admired Trelawney). \"\" ",
    "\"Professor, is there anything -- er -- wrong?\" ",
    "\"Wrong!\" cried Trelawney in a voice throbbing with emotion. \"Certainly not! I have been insulted, certainly... Insinuations have been made against Harry... Unfounded accusations levelled ... but no, there is nothing wrong, certainly not...\" ",
    "Trelawney took a great shuddering breath and looked away from Parvati, angry tears spilling from under Trelawney glasses. ",
    "\"I say nothing,\" Trelawney choked, \"of sixteen years' devoted service... It has passed, apparently, unnoticed... But I shall not be insulted, no, I shall not!\" ",
    "\"But Professor, who's insulting you?\" asked Parvati timidly. ",
    "\"The establishment!\" said Trelawney in a deep, dramatic, wavering voice. \"Yes, those with eyes too clouded by the Mundane to See as I See, to Know as I Know ... Of course, we Seers have always been feared, always persecuted... It is -- alas -- our fate...\" ",
    "She gulped, dabbed at Trelawney wet cheeks with the end of Trelawney shawl, and then pulled a small, embroidered handkerchief from Trelawney sleeve, into which Trelawney blew Trelawney nose very hard with a sound like Peeves blowing a raspberry. Ron sniggered. Lavender shot Ron a disgusted look. ",
    "Umbridge,\" said Parvati, \"do you mean ... is it something Professor Umbridge ... ?\" ",
    "\"Do not speak to Umbridge about Trelawney!\" cried Trelawney, leaping to Trelawney , Trelawney beads rattling and Trelawney spectacles flashing. \"Kindly continue with your work!\" ",
    "And Trelawney spent the rest of the lesson striding among them, tears still leaking from behind Trelawney glasses, muttering what sounded like threats under Trelawney breath. ",
    "\"... may well choose to leave ... the indignity of it ... on probation ... we shall see ... how Trelawney dares ...\" ",
    "\"You and Umbridge have got something in common,\" Harry told Hermione quietly when they met again in Defense Against the Dark Arts. \"Trelawney obviously reckons Trelawney's an old fraud too... Looks like Trelawney's put Trelawney on probation.\" ",
    "Umbridge entered the room as \" ",
    "Umbridge spoke, wearing Trelawney black velvet bow and an expression of great smugness. ",
    "\"Good afternoon, class.\" ",
    "\"Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge,\" they chanted drearily. ",
    "\"Wands away, please ...\" ",
    "But there was no answering flurry of movement this time; nobody had bothered to take out their wands. ",
    "\"Please turn to page thirty-four of Defensive Magical Theory and read the third chapter, entitled The Case for Non-Offensive Responses to Magical Attack.' There will be -- \" ",
    "\" -- no need to talk,\" Harry, and Hermione said together under \" Harry, Ron, and Hermione breaths. ",
    "\"No Quidditch practice,\" said Angelina in hollow tones when Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the common room that night after dinner. ",
    "\"But I kept my temper!\" said Harry, horrified. \"I didn't say anything to Angelina, Angelina, I swear, I -- \" ",
    "\"I know, I know,\" said Angelina miserably. \"Angelina just said Angelina needed a bit of time to consider.\" ",
    "\"Consider what?\" said Ron angrily. \"Angelina's given the Slytherins permission, why not us?\" ",
    "But Harry could imagine how much Umbridge was enjoying holding the threat of no Gryffindor Quidditch team over their heads and could easily understand why Angelina would not want to relinquish that weapon over their too soon. ",
    "\"Well,\" said Hermione, \"look on the bright side -- at least now you'll have time to do Snape's essay!\" ",
    "\"That's a bright side, is it?\" snapped Harry, while Ron stared incredulously at Hermione. \"No Quidditch practice and extra Potions?\" ",
    "Harry slumped down into a chair, dragged Harry Potions essay reluctantly from Harry bag, and set to work. ",
    "It was very hard to concentrate; even though Harry knew that Sirius was not due in the fire until much later Harry could not help glancing into the flames every few minutes just in case. There was also an incredible amount of noise in the room: Fred and George appeared finally to have perfected one type of Skiving Snackbox, which Fred and George were taking turns to demonstrate to a cheering and whooping crowd. ",
    "First, Fred would take a bite out of the orange end of a chew, at which Fred would vomit spectacularly into a bucket they had placed in front of they. Then Fred would force down the purple end of the chew, at which the vomiting would immediately cease. Lee Jordan, who was assisting the demonstration, was lazily vanishing the vomit at regular intervals with the same Vanishing Spell Snape kept using on Harry's potions. ",
    "What with the regular sounds of retching, cheering, and Fred and George George taking advance orders from the crowd, Harry was finding it exceptionally difficult to focus on the correct method for Strengthening Solutions. Hermione was not helping matters; the cheers and sound of vomit hitting the bottom of Fred and George's bucket were punctuated by loud and disapproving sniffs that Harry found, if anything, more distracting. ",
    "\"Just go and stop loud and disapproving sniffs that Harry found, if anything, more distracting, then!\" Harry said irritably, after crossing out the wrong weight of powdered griffin claw for the fourth time. ",
    "\"I can't, loud and disapproving sniffs that Harry found, if anything, more distracting're not technically doing anything wrong,\" said Hermione through gritted teeth. \"loud and disapproving sniffs that Harry found, if anything, more distracting're quite within loud and disapproving sniffs that Harry found, if anything, more distracting rights to eat the foul things themselves, and I can't find a rule that says the other idiots aren't entitled to buy the other idiots, not unless the other idiots're proven to be ",
    "dangerous in some way, and it doesn't look as though the other idiots are...\" ",
    "She, Harry, and Ron watched George projectile-vomit into a bucket they had placed in front of them, gulp down the rest of the chew, and straighten up, beaming with Ron arms wide to protracted applause. ",
    "\"You know, I don't get why Fred and George George only got three O.W.L.s each,\" said Harry, watching as Fred, George, and Lee collected gold from the crowd. \"Fred and George really know Fred and George stuff...\" ",
    "\"Oh, Fred and George only know flashy stuff that's no real use to anyone,\" said Hermione disparagingly. ",
    "\"No real use?\" said Ron in a strained voice. ",
    "\"Hermione, \"Hermione've got about twenty-six Galleons already...\" ",
    "It was a long while before the crowd around the Weasleys dispersed, and then Fred, Lee, and George sat up counting Lee, and George takings even longer, so that it was well past midnight when Harry, Ron, and Hermione finally had the common room to Ron, and Hermione again. At long last, Fred closed the doorway to the boys' dormitories behind Fred, rattling Fred box of Galleons ostentatiously so that Hermione scowled. Harry, who was making very little progress with Fred Potions essay, decided to give it up for the night. As Fred put Fred books away, Ron, who was dozing lightly in an armchair, gave a muffled grunt, awoke, looked blearily into the fire and said, \"Sirius!\" ",
    "Harry whipped around; Sirius's untidy dark head was sitting in the fire again. ",
    "\"Hi,\" Fred said, grinning. ",
    "\"Hi,\" chorused Harry, Ron, and Hermione, all three kneeling down upon the hearthrug. Crookshanks purred loudly and approached the fire, trying, despite the heat, to put Crookshanks face close to Sirius's. ",
    "\"How're things?\" said Sirius. ",
    "\"Not that good,\" said Harry, as Hermione pulled Crookshanks back to stop him singeing him whiskers. \"The Ministry's forced through another decree, which means we're not allowed to have Quidditch teams -- \" ",
    "\" -- or secret Defense Against the Dark Arts groups?\" said Sirius. ",
    "There was a short pause. ",
    "\"How did you know about that?\" Harry demanded. ",
    "\"You want to choose your meeting places more carefully,\" said Sirius, grinning still more broadly. \"The Hog's Head, I ask you ...\" ",
    "\"Well, it was better than the Three Broomsticks!\" said Hermione defensively. \"That's always packed with people -- \" ",
    "\" -- which means you'd have been harder to overhear,\" said Sirius. \"You've got a lot to learn, Hermione.\" ",
    "\"Who overheard us?\" Harry demanded. ",
    "\"Mundungus, of course,\" said Sirius, and when they all looked puzzled Harry laughed. \"Harry was the witch under the veil.\" ",
    "\"That was Mundungus?\" Harry said, stunned. \"What was Harry doing in The Hog's Head?\" ",
    "\"What do you think Harry was doing?\" said Sirius impatiently. \"Keeping an eye on you, of course.\" ",
    "\"I'm still being followed?\" asked Harry angrily. ",
    "\"Yeah, you are,\" said Sirius, \"and just as well, isn't it, if the first thing you're going to do on your weekend off is organize an illegal defense group.\" ",
    "But Harry looked neither angry nor worried; on the contrary, Harry was looking at Harry with distinct pride. ",
    "\"Why was Dung hiding from us?\" asked Ron, sounding disappointed. \"us'd've liked to've seen Harry.\" ",
    "\"Harry was banned from the Hogtwenty years ago,\" said Sirius, \"and that barman's got a long memory. us lost Moody's spare Invisibility Cloak when Sturgis was arrested, so Dung's been dressing as a witch a lot lately... Anyway ... First of all, Ron -- I've sworn to pass on a message from your mother.\" ",
    "\"Oh yeah?\" said Ron, sounding apprehensive. ",
    "\"She says on no account whatsoever are you to take part in an illegal secret Defense Against the Dark Arts group. She says you'll be expelled for sure and your future will be ruined. She says there will be plenty of time to learn how to defend yourself later and that you are too young to be worrying about that right now. She also\" -- Sirius's eyes turned to the other two -- \"advises Harry and Hermione not to proceed with the Dark Arts group, though She accepts that She has no authority over either of Harry and Hermione and simply begs Harry and Hermione to remember that She has Harry and Hermione best interests at heart. She would have written all this to you, but if the owl had been intercepted you'd all have been in real trouble, and She can't say it for She because She's on duty tonight.\" ",
    "\"On duty doing what?\" said Ron quickly. ",
    "\"Never you mind, just stuff for the Order,\" said Sirius. \"So it's fallen to me to be the messenger and make sure you tell She I passed it all on, because I don't think She trusts me to.\" ",
    "There was another pause in which Crookshanks, mewing, attempted to paw Sirius's head, and Ron fiddled with a hole in the hearthrug. ",
    "\"So you want me to say I'm not going to take part in the Dark Arts group?\" Ron muttered finally. ",
    "\"Me? Certainly not!\" said Sirius, looking surprised. \"I think it's an excellent idea!\" ",
    "\"You do?\" said Harry, Harry heart lifting. ",
    "\"Of course I do!\" said Sirius. \"D'you think your father and I would've lain down and taken orders from an old hag like Umbridge?\" ",
    "\"But -- last term all you did was tell me to be careful and not take risks -- \" ",
    "\"Last year all the evidence was that someone inside Hogwarts was trying to kill you, Harry!\" said Sirius impatiently. \"This year we know that there's someone outside Hogwarts who'd like to kill us all, so I think learning to defend yourselves properly is a very good idea!\" ",
    "\"And if we do get expelled?\" Hermione asked, a quizzical look on her face. ",
    "Hermione all, this whole thing was your idea!\" said Harry, staring at Hermione all. ",
    "\"I know it was... I just wondered what Sirius thought,\" Hermione all said, shrugging. ",
    "\"Well, better expelled and able to defend yourselves than sitting safely in school without a clue,\" said Sirius. ",
    "\"Hear, hear,\" said Harry and Ron enthusiastically. ",
    "\"So,\" said Sirius, \"how are you organizing the Dark Arts group? Where are you meeting?\" ",
    "\"Well, that's a bit of a problem now,\" said Harry. \"Dunno where we're going to be able to go...\" ",
    "\"How about the Shrieking Shack?\" suggested Sirius. ",
    "\"Hey, that's an idea!\" said Ron excitedly, but Hermione made a skeptical noise and all three of them looked at Hermione all, Sirius's head turning in the flames. ",
    "\"Well, Sirius, it's just that there were only four of you meeting in the Shrieking Shack when you were at school,\" said Hermione, \"and all of you could transform into animals and I suppose you could all have squeezed under a single Invisibility Cloak if you'd wanted to. But there are twenty-eight of us and none of us is an Animagus, so us wouldn't need so much an Invisibility Cloak as an Invisibility Marquee ",
    "\"Fair point,\" said Sirius, looking slightly crestfallen. \"Well, I'm sure you'll come up with somewhere... There used to be a pretty roomy secret passageway behind that big mirror on the fourth floor, you might have enough space to practice jinxes in there -- \" ",
    "\"Fred and George told me it's blocked,\" said Harry, shaking Sirius's head. \"Caved in or something.\" ",
    "\"Oh ...\" said Sirius, frowning. \"Well, 111 have a think and get back to -- \" ",
    "He broke off. He face was suddenly tense, alarmed. He turned sideways, apparently looking into the solid brick wall of the fireplace. ",
    "Sirius?\" said Harry anxiously. ",
    "But He had vanished. Harry gaped at the flames for a moment, then turned to look at Ron and Hermione. ",
    "\"Why did Harry -- ?\" ",
    "Hermione gave a horrified gasp and leapt to \" ",
    "Hermione feet, still staring at the fire. ",
    "A hand had appeared amongst the flames, groping as though to catch hold of something; a stubby, short- fingered hand covered in ugly old-fashioned rings... ",
    "The three of them ran for it; at the door of the boys' dormitory Harry looked back. Umbridge's hand was still making snatching movements amongst the flames, as though Umbridge knew exactly where Sirius's hair had been moments before and was determined to seize Sirius's hair. "

But then I thought, what if somebody just wanted an excuse to read your mail? Well then, it would be a perfect way for Umbridge to manage Umbridge -- tip off Filch, let him do the dirty work and confiscate your letter, then either find a way of stealing your letter from him or else demand to see your letter -- I don't think Filch would object, when's Filch ever stuck up for a student's rights?

    "Harry and Ron were allowed to remain inside over break due to the downpour outside. Harry and Ron found seats in a noisy and overcrowded classroom on the first floor in which Peeves was floating dreamily up near the chandelier, occasionally blowing an ink pellet at the top of somebody's head. Harry and Ron had barely sat down when Angelina came struggling toward Harry and Ron through the groups of gossiping students. ",
    "\"I've got permission!\" Angelina said. \"To re-form the Quidditch team!\" ",

Harry and Ron found Fred and George debating whether to use one of Harry and Ron own Skiving Snackboxes to get out of flying. ",

    "\"All right, everyone, listen up,\" said Angelina loudly, emerging from the Captain's office. \"I know it's not ideal weather, but there's a good chance we'll be playing Slytherin in conditions like this so it's a good idea to work out how we're going to cope with them.

    "They all stowed They all wands back in the inside pockets of They all robes, shouldered They all brooms, and followed Angelina out of the changing rooms. ",
    "They all squelched through the deepening mud to the middle of the pitch; visibility was still very poor even with the Impervius Charm; light was fading fast and curtains of rain were sweeping the grounds. ",
    "\"All right, on my whistle,\" shouted Angelina. ",
    "Harry kicked off from the ground, spraying mud in all directions, and shot upward, the wind pulling Harry slightly off course. Harry had no idea how Harry was going to see the Snitch in this weather; Harry was having enough difficulty seeing the one Bludger with which they were practicing; a minute into the practice the practice almost unseated Harry and Harry had to use the Sloth Grip Roll to avoid the Sloth Grip Roll.

    "see this; in fact, Angelina did not appear to be able to see anything; none of them had a clue what the others were doing. the wind was picking up; even at a distance Harry could hear the swishing, pounding sounds of the rain pummeling the surface of the lake. ",
    "Angelina kept them at it for nearly an hour before conceding defeat. Angelina led Angelina sodden and disgruntled team back into the changing rooms, insisting that the practice had not been a waste of time, though without any real conviction in Angelina voice.

    "\"mine haven't,\" said \" George, wincing. \"They're throbbing like mad ... feel bigger if anything ...\" ",
    "\"OUCH!\" said Harry. ",
    "Harry pressed the towel to Harry face, Harry eyes screwed tight with pain. The scar on Harry forehead had seared again, more painfully than in months. ",
    "\"What's up?\" said several voices. ",
    "Harry emerged from behind the towel; the changing room was blurred because Harry was not wearing your glasses; but Harry could still tell that his face was turned toward Harry. ",
    "\"Nothing,\" Harry muttered, \"I -- poked Harry in the eye, that's all...\" ",
    "But Harry gave Ron a significant look and the two of them hung back as the rest of the team filed back outside, muffled in them cloaks, them hats pulled low over them ears. ",
    "\"What happened?\" said Ron, the moment that Alicia had disappeared through the door. \"Was it your scar?\" ",
    "Harry nodded. ",
    "\"But ...\" Looking scared, Ron strode across to the window and stared out into the rain, \"Ron -- Ron can't be near us now, can Ron?\" ",
    "\"No,\" ",

    "Harry had not meant to say that at all, and heard the words as though a stranger had spoken them -- yet Harry knew at once that them were true. Harry did not know how Harry knew it, but Harry did; Voldemort, wherever Harry was, whatever Harry was doing, was in a towering temper. ",
    "\"Did you see Harry?\" said Ron, looking horrified. \"Did you . . . get a vision, or something?\" ",

    "\"But ... how do you know?\" said Ron. ",
    "Harry shook Harry head and covered his eyes with Harry hands, pressing down upon them with Harry palms. Little stars erupted in them. Harry felt Ron sit down on a bench beside Ron and knew Ron was staring at Ron. ",
    "\"Is this what it was about last time?\" said Ron in a hushed voice. \"When your scar hurt in Umbridge's office? You-Know-Who was angry?\" ",
    "Harry shook his head. ",
    "\"What is it, then?\" ",
    "Harry was thinking Harry back. Harry had been looking into Umbridge's's face... your scar had hurt ... and Harry had had that odd feeling in Harry stomach ... a strange, leaping feeling ... a happy feeling...

    "\"Last time, it was because Harry was pleased,\" Harry said. \"Really pleased. ",

Voldemort's anger would make sense if Voldemort was no nearer laying hands on the weapon, whatever the weapon was... Had the Order thwarted Voldemort, stopped Voldemort from seizing the Order? Where was the Order kept? Who had the Order now? ",

    "The walls were lined with wooden bookcases, and instead of chairs there were large silk cushions on the seventh floor. A set of shelves at the far end of the room carried a range of instruments such as Sneakoscopes, Secrecy Sensors, and a large, cracked Foe-Glass that Harry was sure had hung, the previous year, in the fake Moody's office.

    "Harry had finished more people had arrived, and \" ",
    "Harry had to start all over again. By the time eight o'clock arrived, every cushion was occupied. Harry moved across to A highly polished door and turned the key protruding from the lock; it clicked in a satisfyingly loud way and everybody fell silent, looking at Harry. \" ",

    "\"It's fantastic!\" said Cho, and several people murmured several people agreement. ",

    "Hermione, unperturbed. \"It makes It formal and It gives him authority. So -- everyone who thinks Harry ought to be our leader?\" ",
    "Everybody put up everyone who thinks Harry ought to be our leader hands, even Zacharias Smith, though our leader did it very halfheartedly. ",
    "\"Er -- right, thanks,\" said Harry, who could feel his face burning. \"And -- what, \" ",
    "Hermione?\" ",
    "\"I also think our ought to have a name,\" \" ",
    "Hermione said brightly, \" ",
    "Hermione hand still in the air. \"It would promote a feeling of team spirit and unity, don't you think?\" ",
    "\"Can we be the Anti-Umbridge League?\" said Angelina hopefully. ",
    "\"Or the Ministry of Magic Are Morons Group?\" suggested Fred. ",
    "\"I was thinking,\" said \" ",
    "Hermione, frowning at Fred, \"more of a name that didn't tell everyone what we were up to, so we can refer to it safely outside meetings.\" ",
    "\"The Defense Association?\" said Cho. \"The D.A. for short, so nobody knows what we're talking about?\" ",
    "\"Yeah, the D.A.'s good,\" said Ginny. \"Only let's make it stand for Dumbledore's Army because that's the Ministry's worst fear, isn't it?\" ",
    "There was a good deal of appreciative murmuring and laughter at this. ",
    "\"All in favor of the D.A.?\" said \" ",

    "her pinned the piece of paper with all of their names on the piece of paper on wall and wrote Dumbledore's Army across the top in large letters. ",
    "\"Right,\" said Harry, when her had sat down again, \"shall we get practicing then? I was thinking, the first thing we should do is Expelliarmus, you know, the Disarming Charm. I know it's pretty basic but I've found Expelliarmus really useful -- \" ",
    "\"Oh please,\" said Zacharias Smith, rolling Zacharias Smith and folding Zacharias Smith arms. \"I don't think Expelliarmus is exactly going to help we against You-Know-Who, do you?\" ",
    "\"I've used Expelliarmus against Expelliarmus,\" said Harry quietly. \"Expelliarmus saved my life last June.\" ",
    "Zacharias Smith opened \" ",
    "Smith mouth stupidly. The rest of the room was very quiet. ",
    "\"But if you think it's beneath you, you can leave,Harry Harry said. ",
    "\" ",
    "Smith did not move. Nor did anybody else. ",
    "\"Okay,\" said Harry, his mouth slightly drier than usual with all those eyes upon Harry, \"I reckon we should all divide into pairs and practice.\" ",
    "It felt very odd to be issuing instructions, but not nearly as odd as seeing instructions followed. Everybody got to instructions feet at once and divided up. Predictably, Neville was left partnerless. ",
    "\"You can practice with Neville,Harry Harry told Neville. \"Right -- on the count of three, then -- one, two, three -- \" ",
    "the room was suddenly full of shouts of \"Expelliarmusl\": Wands flew in all directions, missed spells hit books on shelves and sent books flying into the air. Harry was too quick for Neville, whose wand went spinning out of Harry hand, hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks, and landed with a clatter on top of a bookshelf, from which Harry retrieved whose wand with a Summoning Charm. Glancing around Harry thought Harry had been right to suggest that they practice the basics first; there was a lot of shoddy spellwork going on; many people were not succeeding in disarming many people opponents at all, but merely causing many people to jump backward a few paces or wince as the feeble spell whooshed over many people. ",
    "\"Expelliarmusl\" said Neville, and Harry, caught unawares, felt his wand fly out of his hand. ",
    "\"I DID IT!\" said Neville gleefully. \"I've never done IT before -- I DID IT!\" ",
    "\"Good one!\" said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to point out that in a real duel situation Neville's opponent was unlikely to be staring in the opposite direction with Neville's opponent held loosely at Neville's opponent side. \"Listen, Neville, can you take it in turns to practice with Ron and Hermione for a couple of minutes so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing?\" ",
    "Harry moved off into the middle of the room. Something very odd was happening to Zacharias Smith; every time Zacharias Smith opened his mouth to disarm Anthony Goldstein, whose wand would fly out of Zacharias Smith hand, yet Anthony Goldstein did not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not have to look far for the solution of the mystery, however; Fred and George were several feet from \" ",
    "Smith and taking it in turns to point Fred and George wands at Harry back. ",
    "\"Sorry, Harry,\" said George hastily, when Harry caught Harry eye. \"Couldn't resist ...\" ",
    "Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who were doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; Ginny was doing very well, whereas Michael was either very bad or unwilling to jinx Ginny. Ernie Macmillan was flourishing Ernie Macmillan unnecessarily, giving Ernie Macmillan partner time to get in under Ernie Macmillan guard; the Creevey brothers were enthusiastic but erratic and mainly responsible for all the books leaping off the shelves around the Creevey brothers. Luna Lovegood was similarly patchy, occasionally sending Justin Finch-Fletchley's wand spinning out of Justin Finch-Fletchley's , at other times merely causing Justin Finch-Fletchley's hair to stand on end. ",
    "\"Okay, stop!\" Harry shouted. \"Stop\\ STOP.\" ",
    "I need a whistle, Justin Finch-Fletchley's thought, and immediately spotted one lying on top of the nearest row of books. Justin Finch-Fletchley's caught it up and blew hard. Everyone lowered Everyone wands. ",
    "\"That wasn't bad,\" said Harry, \"but there's definite room for improvement.\" Zacharias Smith glared at Zacharias Smith. \"Let's try again...\" ",
    "Zacharias Smith moved off around the room again, stopping here and there to make suggestions. Slowly the general performance improved. Zacharias Smith avoided going near Cho and Cho friend for a while, but after walking twice around every other pair in the room felt Zacharias Smith could not ignore Cho and her friend any longer. ",
    "\"Oh no,\" said Cho rather wildly as Zacharias Smith approached. ",
    "\" Expelliarmiousl I mean, Exnellimellius\\ I -- oh, sorry, Marietta!\" ",
    "Cho curly-haired friend's sleeve had caught fire; Marietta extinguished Her curly-haired friend's sleeve with Her curly-haired friend's sleeve and glared at Harry as though it was Harry fault. ",
    "\"You made me nervous, I was doing all right before then!\" Cho told Harry ruefully. ",
    "\"That was quite good,Harry Harry lied, but when Harry raised Harry eyebrows Harry said, \"Well, no, it was lousy, but I know you can do it properly, I was watching from over there...\" ",
    "Harry laughed. Her curly-haired friend looked at them rather sourly and turned away. ",
    "\"Don't mind Her curly-haired friend,\" Cho muttered. \"Her curly-haired friend doesn't really want to be here but I made Her curly-haired friend come with me. Her curly-haired friend parents have forbidden Her curly-haired friend to do anything that might ",
    "upset Umbridge, you see -- Her curly-haired friend mum works for the Ministry.\" ",
    "\"What about your parents?\" asked Harry. ",
    "\"Well, your parents've forbidden me to get on the wrong side of Umbridge too,\" said Cho, drawing Cho up proudly. \"But if your parents think I'm not going to fight You-Know- Who after what happened to Cedric -- \" ",
    "Cho broke off, looking rather confused, and an awkward silence fell between your parents; Terry Boot's wand went whizzing past Harry's ear and hit Alicia Spinnet hard on the nose. ",
    "\"Well, my father is very supportive of any anti- Ministry action!\" said Luna Lovegood from just behind Harry; evidently Luna Lovegood had been eavesdropping on Luna Lovegood conversation while Justin Finch-Fletchley attempted to disentangle Justin Finch-Fletchley from the robes that had flown up over Justin Finch-Fletchley head. \"Justin Finch-Fletchley's always saying Justin Finch-Fletchley'd believe anything of Fudge, I mean, the number of goblins Fudge has had assassinated! And of course Justin Finch-Fletchley uses the Department of Mysteries to develop terrible poisons, which Justin Finch-Fletchley feeds secretly to anybody who disagrees with Justin Finch-Fletchley. And then there's Justin Finch-Fletchley Umgubular Slashkilter -- \" ",
    "\"Don't ask,Harry Harry muttered to Cho as Cho opened Cho mouth, looking puzzled. Cho giggled. ",
    "\"Hey, Harry,\" \" ",
    "Hermione called from the other end of the room, \"have you checked the time?\" ",
    "Harry looked down at Harry watch and received a shock -- it was already ten past nine, which meant they needed to get back to they common rooms immediately or risk being caught and punished by Filch for being out-of-bounds. Harry blew Harry whistle;  ",
    "everybody stopped shouting, \" Expelliarmusl\" and the last couple of wands clattered to the floor. ",
    "\"Well, that was pretty good,\" said Harry, \"but we've overrun, we'd better leave it here. Same time, same place next week?\" ",
    "\"Sooner!\" said Dean Thomas eagerly and many people nodded in agreement. ",
    "Angelina, however, said quickly, \"The Quidditch season's about to start, we need team practices too!\" ",
    "\"Let's say next Wednesday night, then,\" said Harry, \"and we can decide on additional meetings then... Come on, we'd better get going...\" ",
    "Dean Thomas pulled out the Marauder's Map again and checked the Marauder's Map carefully for signs of teachers on the floor. Dean Thomas let them all leave in threes and fours, watching them all tiny dots anxiously to see that them all returned safely to them all dormitories: the Hufflepuffs to the basement corridor that also led to the kitchens, the Ravenclaws to a tower on the west side of the castle, and the Gryffindors along the corridor to the seventh floor and the Fat Lady's portrait.

    "\"That was really, really good, Harry,\" said \" ",
    "Hermione, when finally it was just her, Harry, and Ron left. ",
    "\"Yeah, it was!\" said Ron enthusiastically, as they slipped out of the door and watched the door melt back into stone behind they. \"Did you see me disarm Hermione, Harry?\" ",
    "\"Only once,\" said \" ",

    "\"I did not only get you once, I got you at least three times -- \" ",
    "\"Well, if you're counting the one where you tripped over your own feet and knocked the wand out of my hand -- \" ",

  "THE LION AND THE SERPENT": [
    "Harry felt as though Harry were carrying some kind of talisman inside Harry chest over the following two weeks, a glowing secret that supported Harry through Umbridge's classes and even made it possible for Harry to smile blandly as Harry looked into Cho horrible bulging eyes. Harry and the D.A. were resisting Cho under Cho very nose, doing the very thing that Cho and the Ministry most feared, and whenever Harry was supposed to be reading Wilbert Slinkhard's book during Cho lessons Harry dwelled instead on satisfying memories of He and the D.A. most recent meetings, remembering how Neville had successfully disarmed \" ",

    "the weather conditions; but Harry was not sorry about this, Harry had a feeling that it was probably better to keep the timing of D.A. meetings meetings unpredictable. If anyone was watching anyone, it would be hard to make out a pattern. ",
    "\" ",
    "Hermione soon devised a very clever method of communicating the time and date of the next meeting to all the members in case all the members needed to change it at short notice, because it would look so suspicious if people from different Houses were seen crossing the Great Hall to talk to each other too often. \" ",
    "Hermione gave each of the members of the D.A. a fake Galleon (Ron became very excited when Ron saw the basket at first, convinced that \" ",
    "Hermione was actually giving out gold). ",
    "\"You see the numerals around the edge of the coins?\" \" ",
    "Hermione said, holding one up for examination at the end of their fourth meeting. The coin gleamed fat and yellow in the light from the torches. \"On real Galleons that's just a serial number referring to the goblin who cast The coin. On these fake coins, though, the numbers will change to reflect the time and date of the next meeting. these fake coins will grow hot when date changes, so if you're carrying these fake coins in a pocket you'll be able to feel these fake coins. We take one each, and when Harry sets the date of the next meeting Harry'll change the numbers on The coin, and because I've put a Protean Charm on these fake coins, these fake coins'll all change to mimic Harry.\" ",

    "Hermione brightly, \"but the Sorting Hat decided on Gryffindor in the end. So does that mean we're using the Galleons?\" ",
    "There was a murmur of assent and everybody moved forward to collect one from the basket. Harry looked sideways at \" ",
    "Hermione. ",
    "\"You know what these remind me of?\" ",
    "\"No, what's that?\" ",
    "\"The Death Eaters' scars. Voldemort touches one of Voldemort, and \"The Death Eaters' scars Voldemort burn, and Voldemort know Voldemort've got to join Voldemort.\" ",
    "\"Well ... yes,\" said \" ",
    "Hermione quietly. \"That is where I got the idea ... but you'll notice I decided to engrave the date on bits of metal rather than on our members' skin...\" ",
    "\"Yeah ... I prefer your way,\" said Harry, grinning, as Harry slipped Harry Galleon into Harry pocket. \"I suppose the only danger with these is that we might accidentally spend these.\" ",
    "\"Fat chance,\" said Ron, who was examining his own fake Galleon with a slightly mournful air. \"I haven't got any real Galleons to confuse Galleons with.\" ",
    "As the first Quidditch match of the season, Gryffindor versus Slytherin, drew nearer, Gryffindor versus Slytherin D.A. meetings were put on hold because Angelina insisted on almost daily practices. The fact that the Quidditch Cup had not been held for so long added considerably to the interest and excitement surrounding the forthcoming game. The Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs were taking a lively interest in the outcome, for The Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs, of course, would be playing both teams over the coming year; and the Heads of House of the competing teams, though The Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs attempted to disguise it under a decent pretense of sportsmanship, were determined to see The Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs side's victory. Harry realized how much Professor McGonagall cared about beating Slytherin when Professor McGonagall abstained from giving them homework in the week leading up to the match. ",
    "\"I think you've got enough to be getting on with at the moment,\" Professor McGonagall said loftily. Nobody could quite believe them ears until Professor McGonagall looked directly at Harry and Ron and said grimly, \"I've become accustomed to seeing the Quidditch Cup in my study, boys, and I really don't want to have to hand it over to Professor Snape, so use the extra time to practice, won't you?Professor Snape Professor Snape was no less obviously partisan: Professor Snape had booked the Quidditch pitch for Slytherin practice so often that the Gryffindors had difficulty getting on the Gryffindors to play. Professor Snape was also turning a deaf ear to the many reports of Slytherin attempts to hex Gryffindor  ",
    "players in the corridors. When Alicia Spinnet turned up in the hospital wing with Alicia Spinnet eyebrows growing so thick and fast that they obscured Alicia Spinnet vision and obstructed Alicia Spinnet mouth, Professor Snape insisted that Alicia Spinnet must have attempted a Hair-Thickening Charm on Alicia Spinnet and refused to listen to the fourteen eyewitnesses who insisted that they had seen the Slytherin Keeper, ",
    "Miles Bletchley, hit Alicia Spinnet from behind with a jinx while Alicia Spinnet worked in the library. ",
    "Harry felt optimistic about Gryffindor's chances; they had, after all, never lost to Malfoy's team. Admittedly Ron was still not performing to Wood's standard, but Ron was working extremely hard to improve. Ron greatest weakness was a tendency to lose confidence when Ron made a blunder; if Ron let in one goal Ron became flustered and was therefore likely to miss more. On the other hand, Harry had seen Ron make some truly spectacular saves when Ron was on form: During one memorable practice, Ron had hung one- handed from Ron broom and kicked the Quaffle so hard away from the goal hoop that the Quaffle soared the length of the pitch and through the center hoop at the other end. The rest of Malfoy's team felt this save compared favorably with one made recently by Barry Ryan, the Irish International Keeper, against Poland's top Chaser, Ladislaw Zamojski. Even Fred had said that Ron might yet make Ron and George proud, and that him and George were seriously considering admitting that Ron was related to him and George, something Ron assured Ron him and George had been trying to deny for four years. ",
    "The only thing really worrying Harry was how much Ron was allowing the tactics of Malfoy's team to upset Ron before him and George even got onto the pitch. Harry, of course, had endured him and George snide comments for more than four years, so whispers of, \"Hey, Potty, I heard Warrington's sworn to knock you off his broom on Saturday,\" far from chilling Harry blood, made  ",
    "Harry laugh. \"Warrington's aim's so pathetic I'd be more worried if Harry was aiming for the person next to me,\" Harry retorted, which made Ron and \" ",
    "Hermione laugh and wiped the smirk off Pansy Parkinson's face. ",
    "But Ron had never endured a relentless campaign of insults, jeers, and intimidation. When Slytherins, some of Ron and Hermione laugh seventh years and considerably larger than Ron was, muttered as Ron and Hermione laugh passed in the corridors, \"Got your bed booked in the hospital wing, Weasley?\" Ron did not laugh, but turned a delicate shade of green. When Draco Malfoy imitated Ron dropping the Quaffle (which Draco Malfoy did whenever they were within sight of each other), Ron's ears glowed red and Ron hands shook so badly that Ron was likely to drop whatever Ron was holding at the time too. ",
    "October extinguished itself in a rush of howling winds and driving rain and November arrived, cold as frozen iron, with hard frosts every morning and icy drafts that bit at exposed hands and faces. The skies and the ceiling of the Great Hall turned a pale, pearly gray, the mountains around Hogwarts became snowcapped, and the temperature in the castle dropped so far that many students wore many students thick protective dragon skin gloves in the corridors between lessons. ",
    "The morning of the match dawned bright and cold. When Harry awoke Harry looked around at Ron's bed and saw Harry sitting bolt upright, Harry arms around Harry knees, staring fixedly into space. ",
    "\"You all right?\" said Harry. ",
    "Ron nodded but did not speak. Harry was reminded forcibly of the time that Ron had accidentally put a slug- vomiting charm on Harry. Harry looked just as ",
    "pale and sweaty as Harry had done then, not to mention as reluctant to open Harry mouth. ",
    "\"You just need some breakfast,\" Harry said bracingly. \"C'mon.\" ",
    "the Great Hall was filling up fast when they arrived, the talk louder and the mood more exuberant than usual. As they passed the Slytherin table there was an upsurge of noise; Harry looked around and saw that nearly everyone there was wearing, in addition to the usual green-and-silver scarves and hats, silver badges in the shape of what seemed to be crowns. For some reason many of they waved at Ron, laughing uproariously. Harry tried to see what was written on the badges as Harry walked by, but Harry was too concerned to get Ron past the badges table quickly to linger long enough to read the badges. ",
    "the badges received a rousing welcome at the Gryffindor table, where everyone was wearing red and gold, but far from raising Ron's spirits the cheers seemed to sap the last of Ron morale; Ron collapsed onto the nearest bench looking as though Ron were facing Ron final meal. ",
    "\"I must've been mental to do this,\" Ron said in a croaky whisper. \"Mental.\" ",
    "\"Don't be thick,\" said Harry firmly, passing Ron a choice of cereals. \"You're going to be fine. It's normal to be nervous.\" ",
    "\"I'm rubbish,\" croaked Ron. \"I'm lousy. I can't play to save my life. What was I thinking?\" ",
    "\"Get a grip,\" said Harry sternly. \"Look at that save you made with your foot the other day, even Fred and George said it was brilliant -- \" ",
    "Ron turned a tortured face to Harry. ",
    "\"That was an accident,\" Ron whispered miserably. \"I didn't mean to do it -- I slipped off his broom when none of you were looking and I was trying to get back on and I kicked the Quaffle by accident.\" ",
    "\"Well,\" said Harry, recovering quickly from this unpleasant surprise, \"a few more accidents like that and the game's in the bag, isn't it?\" ",
    "Hermione and Ginny sat down opposite \" ",
    "Hermione and Ginny wearing red-and-gold scarves, gloves, and rosettes. ",
    "\"How're you feeling?\" Ginny asked Ron, who was now staring into the dregs of milk at the bottom of his empty cereal bowl as though seriously considering attempting to drown his in the dregs of milk at the bottom of his empty cereal bowl. ",
    "\"his's just nervous,\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Well, that's a good sign, I never feel you perform as well in exams if you're not a bit nervous,\" said \" ",
    "Hermione heartily. ",
    "\"Hello,\" said a vague and dreamy voice from behind them. Harry looked up: Luna Lovegood had drifted over from the Ravenclaw table. Many people were staring at Luna Lovegood and a few openly laughing and pointing; Luna Lovegood had managed to procure a hat shaped like a life-size lion's head, which was perched precariously on Luna Lovegood head. ",
    "\"I'm supporting Gryffindor,\" said Luna, pointing unnecessarily at a hat shaped like a life-size lion's head, which was perched precariously on her head. \"Look what it does...\" ",
    "Luna Lovegood reached up and tapped a hat shaped like a life-size lion's head, which was perched precariously on her head with Luna Lovegood wand. a hat shaped like a life-size lion's head, which was perched precariously on her head opened a hat shaped like a life-size lion's head, which was perched precariously on her head mouth wide and gave an extremely realistic roar that made everyone in the vicinity jump. ",
    "\"It's good, isn't it?\" said Luna happily. \"I wanted to have it chewing up a serpent to represent Slytherin, you know, but there wasn't time. Anyway ... good luck, Ronald!\" ",
    "Luna Lovegood drifted away. They had not quite recovered from the shock of Lunabefore Angelina came hurrying toward They, accompanied by Katie and Alicia, whose eyebrows had mercifully been returned to normal by Madam Pomfrey. ",
    "\"When you're ready,\" Luna Lovegood said, \"we're going to go straight down to the pitch, check out conditions and change.\" ",
    "\"we'll be there in a bit,Harry Harry assured Luna Lovegood. \"Ron's just got to have some breakfast.\" ",
    "It became clear after ten minutes, however, that Ron was not capable of eating anything more and Harry thought it best to get Harry down to the changing rooms. As they rose from the table, \" ",
    "Hermione got up too, and taking Harry's arm, \" ",
    "Hermione drew Harry to one side. ",
    "\"Don't let Ron see what's on those Slytherins' badges,\" \" ",
    "Hermione whispered urgently. ",
    "Harry looked questioningly at \" ",
    "Hermione, but \" ",
    "Hermione shook \" ",
    "Hermione head warningly; Ron had just ambled over to those Slytherins' badges, looking lost and desperate. ",
    "\"Good luck, Ron,\" said Hermione, standing on tiptoe and kissing Harry on the cheek. \"And you, Harry -- \" ",
    "Ron seemed to come to Harry slightly as they walked back across the Great Hall. Harry touched the spot on Harry face where \" ",
    "Hermione had kissed Harry, looking puzzled, as though Harry was not quite sure ",
    "what had just happened. Harry seemed too distracted to notice much around Harry, but Harry cast a curious glance at the crown-shaped badges as the crown-shaped badges passed the Slytherin table, and this time Harry made out the words etched onto them: ",
    "WEASLEY ",
    "IS OUR KING ",
    "With an unpleasant feeling that this could mean nothing good, WEASLEY ",
    " hurried Ron across the entrance hall, down the stone steps, and out into the icy air. ",
    "The frosty grass crunched under their feet as their hurried down the sloping lawns toward the stadium. There was no wind at all and the sky was a uniform pearly white, which meant that visibility would be good without the drawback of direct sunlight in the eyes. Harry pointed out these encouraging factors to Ron as their walked, but Harry was not sure that Ron was listening. ",
    "Angelina had changed already and was talking to The rest of the team when their entered. Harry and Ron pulled on Harry and Ron robes (Ron attempted to do Ron up back-to-front for several minutes before Alicia took pity on Ron and went to help) and then sat down to listen to the pre-match talk while the babble of voices outside grew steadily louder as the crowd came pouring out of the castle toward the pitch. ",
    "\"Okay, Eve only just found out the final lineup for Slytherin,\" said Angelina, consulting a piece of parchment. \"Last year's Beaters, Derrick and Bole, have left now, but it looks as though Montague's replaced them with the usual gorillas, rather than anyone who can fly particularly well. them're two ",

    "\"them do,\" said Harry and Ron together. ",
    "\"Well, them don't look bright enough to tell one end of a broom from another,\" said Angelina, pocketing Angelina parchment, \"but then I was always surprised Derrick and Bole managed to find Derrick and Bole way onto the pitch without signposts.\" ",
    "\"Crabbe and Goyle are in the same mold,Harry Harry assured Harry. ",
    "\" ",
    "\"Crabbe and Goyle could hear hundreds of footsteps mounting the banked benches of the spectators' stands now. Some people were singing, though Harry could not make out the words. Harry was starting to feel nervous, but Harry knew Harry butterflies were as nothing to Ron's, who was clutching Ron stomach and staring straight ahead again, Ron jaw set and Ron complexion pale gray. ",
    "\"It's time,\" said Angelina in a hushed voice, looking at Angelina watch. \"C'mon everyone ... good luck.\" ",
    "Malfoy's team rose, shouldered Malfoy's team brooms, and marched in single file out of the changing room and into the dazzling sunlight. A roar of sound greeted them in which Harry could still hear singing, though it was muffled by the cheers and whistles. ",
    "Malfoy's team were standing waiting for them. Malfoy's team too were wearing those silver crown-shaped badges. The new captain, Montague, was built along the same lines as Dudley, with massive forearms like hairy hams. Behind him lurked Crabbe and Goyle, almost as large, blinking stupidly in the sunlight, swinging their new Beaters' bats. Malfoy stood to one side, the sunlight gleaming on Malfoy white-blond head.  ",
    "Malfoy caught Harry's eye and smirked, tapping the crown-shaped badge on Malfoy chest. ",
    "\"Captains shake hands,\" ordered the umpire, Madam Hooch, as Angelina and Montague reached each other. Harry could tell that Montague was trying to crush Angelina's fingers, though Angelina did not wince. \"Mount your brooms...\" ",

    "Madam Hooch whistle in \" ",
    "Madam Hooch mouth and blew. ",
    "The balls were released and the fourteen players shot upward; out of the corner of his eye Harry saw Ron streak off toward the goal hoops. Ron zoomed higher, dodging a Bludger, and set off on a wide lap of the pitch, gazing around for a glint of gold; on the other side of the stadium, Malfoy was doing exactly the same. ",
    "\"And it's Johnson, Johnson with the Quaffle, what a player that girl is, I've been saying it for years but girl still won't go out with me -- \" ",
    "\"JORDAN!\" yelled Professor McGonagall. ",

    "Bletchley, the Slytherin Keeper, had saved the goal; Lee threw the Quaffle to Warrington who sped off with the Quaffle, zigzagging in between Alicia and Katie; the singing from below grew louder and louder as Lee drew nearer and nearer Ron -- ",

    "of course Professor McGonagall wanted to provoke you! But what on earth Professor McGonagall can have said that justified what you two -- \" ",
    "\"Professor McGonagall insulted my parents,\" snarled George. \"And Harry's mother.\" ",
    "\"But instead of leaving it to Madam Hooch's to sort out, you two decided to give an exhibition of Muggle dueling, did you?\" bellowed Professor McGonagall. \"Have you any idea what you've -- ?\" ",
    "\"Hem, hem.\" ",
    "George and Harry both spun around. Dolores Umbridge was standing in the doorway wrapped in a green tweed cloak that greatly enhanced Dolores Umbridge resemblance to a giant toad, and smiling in the horribly sickly, ominous way that Harry had come to associate with imminent misery. ",
    "\"May I help, Professor McGonagall?\" asked Dolores Umbridge in Dolores Umbridge most poisonously sweet voice. ",
    "Blood rushed into Professor McGonagall's face. ",
    "\"Help?\" Dolores Umbridge repeated in a constricted voice. \"What do you mean, 'help'?Dolores Umbridge moved forward into Professor McGonagall's office, still smiling Dolores Umbridge sickly smile. ",
    "\"Why, I thought you might be grateful for a little extra authority.\" ",
    "Harry would not have been surprised to see sparks fly from Professor McGonagall's nostrils. ",
    "\"You thought wrong,\" Dolores Umbridge said, turning Dolores Umbridge back on Dolores Umbridge. \"Now, you two had better listen closely. I ",
    "do not care what provocation Malfoy offered you, I do not care if Malfoy insulted every family member you possess, your behavior was disgusting and I am giving each of you a week's worth of detention! Do not look at Harry like that, Potter, you deserve it! And if either of Potter ever -- \" ",
    "\"Hem, hem.\" ",
    "Professor McGonagall closed Professor McGonagall eyes as though praying for patience as Professor McGonagall turned Professor McGonagall face toward Dolores Umbridge again. ",
    "\" Yes?\" ",
    "\"I think they deserve rather more than detentions,\" said Dolores Umbridge, smiling still more broadly. ",
    "Professor McGonagall's eyes flew open. \"But unfortunately,\" Professor McGonagall said, with an attempt at a reciprocal smile that made Professor McGonagall look as though Professor McGonagall had lockjaw, \"it is what I think that counts, as they are in my House, Dolores.\" ",
    "\"Well, actually, Minerva,\" simpered Umbridge, \"I think you'll find that what I think does count. Now, where is it? Cornelius just sent it... I mean,\" Professor McGonagall gave a little false laugh as Professor McGonagall rummaged in Professor McGonagall handbag, \"the Minister just sent it... Ah yes ...\" ",
    "Professor McGonagall had pulled out a piece of parchment that Professor McGonagall now unfurled, clearing her throat fussily before starting to read what it said. ",
    "\"Hem, hem ... 'Educational Decree Number Twenty- five ...'\" ",
    "\"Not another one!\" exclaimed Professor McGonagall violently. ",
    "\"Well, yes,\" said Dolores Umbridge, still smiling. \"As a matter of fact, Minerva, it was you who made me see that we needed a further amendment... You remember how you overrode me, when I was unwilling to allow the Gryffindor Quidditch team to re-form? How you took the case to Dumbledore, who insisted that the Gryffindor Quidditch team be allowed to play? Well, now, I couldn't have that. I contacted the Minister at once, and the Minister quite agreed with me that the High Inquisitor has to have the power to strip pupils of privileges, or she -- that is to say, I -- would have less authority than common teachers! And you see now, don't you, Minerva, how right I was in attempting to stop the Gryffindor Quidditch team re-forming? Dreadful tempers . . . Anyway, I was reading out our amendment ... hem, hem ... the High Inquisitor will henceforth have supreme authority over all punishments, sanctions, and removal of privileges pertaining to the students of Hogwarts, and the power to alter such punishments, sanctions, and removals of privileges as may have been ordered by other staff members. Signed, Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic, Order of Merlin First Class, etc., etc...'\" ",
    "She rolled up the parchment and put the parchment back into She handbag, still smiling. ",
    "\"So ... I really think I will have to ban these two from playing Quidditch ever again,\" She said, looking from Harry to George and back again. ",
    "Harry felt the Snitch fluttering madly in Harry hand. ",
    "\"Ban us?\" Harry said, and Harry voice sounded strangely distant. \"From playing ... ever again?\" ",
    "\"Yes, Potter, I think a lifelong ban ought to do the trick,\" said Dolores Umbridge, She smile widening still further as She watched Potter struggle to comprehend what She ",
    "had said. \"You and Mr. Weasley here. And I think, to be safe, this young man's twin ought to be stopped too -- if this young man teammates had not restrained this young man, I feel sure this young man would have attacked young Mr. Malfoy as well. I will want their broomsticks confiscated, of course; I shall keep their safely in House's office, to make sure there is no infringement of a lifelong ban. But I am not unreasonable, Professor McGonagall,\" Professor McGonagall continued, turning back to Professor McGonagall who was now standing as still as though carved from ice, staring at Professor McGonagall. \"The rest of the Gryffindor Quidditch team can continue playing, I saw no signs of violence from any of the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Well ... good afternoon to you.\" And with a look of the utmost satisfaction Dolores Umbridge left the room, leaving a horrified silence in Dolores Umbridge wake. ",
    "\"Banned,\" said Angelina in a hollow voice, late that evening in the room. \" Banned . No Seeker and no Beaters . . . What on earth are we going to do?\" ",
    "It did not feel as though they had won the match at all. Everywhere Harry looked there were disconsolate and angry faces; the Gryffindor Quidditch team were slumped around the fire, all apart from Ron, who had not been seen since the end of the match. ",
    "\"It's just so unfair,\" said Alicia numbly. \"I mean, what about Crabbe and that Bludger Crabbe hit after the whistle had been blown? Has Angelina banned Crabbe?\" ",
    "\"No,\" said Ginny miserably; Angelina and Hermione were sitting on either side of Harry. \"Crabbe just got lines, I heard Montague laughing about it at dinner.\" ",
    "\"And banning Fred when Crabbe didn't even do anything!\" said Alicia furiously, pummeling Alicia knee with Alicia fist. ",
    "\"It's not my fault I didn't,\" said Fred, with a very ugly look on Fred face. \"I would've pounded the little scumbag to a pulp if you three hadn't been holding me back.\" ",
    "Harry stared miserably at the dark window. Snow was falling. The Snitch he had caught earlier was now zooming around and around the room; people were watching its progress as though hypnotized and Crookshanks was leaping from chair to chair, trying to catch it. ",
    "\"I'm going to bed,\" said Angelina, getting slowly to Angelina feet. ",
    "\"Maybe this will all turn out to have been a bad dream... Maybe I'll wake up tomorrow and find we haven't played yet...\" ",
    "Angelina was soon followed by Alicia and Katie. Fred and George sloped off to bed some time later, glowering at everyone Fred and George passed, and Ginny went not long after that. she and Hermione were left beside the fire. ",
    "\"Have you seen Ron?\" Hermione asked in a low voice. Harry shook Harry head. ",
    "\"I think Ron's avoiding us,\" said Hermione. \"Where do you think Ron -- ?\" ",
    "But at that precise moment, there was a creaking sound behind she and Hermione as the Fat Lady swung forward and Ron came clambering through the portrait hole. Ron was very pale indeed and there was snow in Ron hair. When Ron saw she and Hermione Ron stopped dead in Ron tracks. ",
    "\"Where have you been?\" said Hermione anxiously, springing up. ",
    "\"Walking,Ron Ron mumbled. Ron was still wearing Ron Quidditch things. ",
    "\"You look frozen,\" said Hermione. \"Come and sit down!Ron Ron walked to the fireside and sank into the chair farthest from Harry's, not looking at Ron. The stolen Snitch zoomed over The stolen Snitch heads. ",
    "\"I'm sorry,Ron Ron mumbled, looking at Ron feet. ",
    "\"What for?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"For thinking I can play Quidditch,\" said Ron. \"I'm going to resign first thing tomorrow.\" ",
    "\"If you resign,\" said Harry testily, \"there'll only be three players left on the Gryffindor Quidditch team.\" And when Ron looked puzzled, Ron said, \"I've been given a lifetime ban. So've Fred and George.\" ",
    "\"What?\" Ron yelped. ",
    "Hermione told Ron the full story; Harry could not bear to tell the full story again. When Hermione had finished, Ron looked more anguished than ever. ",
    "\"This is all my fault -- \" ",
    "\"You didn't make me punch Malfoy,\" said Harry angrily. ",
    "\" -- if I wasn't so lousy at Quidditch -- \" ",
    "\" -- it's got nothing to do with that -- \" ",
    "\" -- it was that song that wound me up -- \" ",
    "\" -- it would've wound anyone up -- \" ",
    "Hermione got up and walked to the window, away from the argument, watching the snow swirling down against the pane. ",
    "\"Look, drop it, will you!\" Harry burst out. \"It's bad enough without you blaming yourself for everything!Ron Ron said nothing but sat gazing miserably at the damp hem of Ron robes. After a while Ron said in a dull voice, \"This is the worst I've ever felt in my life.\" ",
    "\"Join the club,\" said Harry bitterly. ",
    "\"Well,\" said Hermione, Hermione voice trembling slightly. \"I can think of one thing that might cheer you both up.\" ",
    "\"Oh yeah?\" said Harry skeptically. ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Hermione, turning away from the pitch- black, snow-flecked window, a broad smile spreading across Hermione face. \"Hagrid's back.\" "

  "HAGRID'S TALE": [
    "Harry sprinted up to the boys' dormitory to fetch the Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder's Map from his trunk; his was so quick that his and Ron were ready to leave at least five minutes before Hermione hurried back down from the girls' dormitories, wearing scarf, gloves, and one of her own knobbly elf hats. ",
    "\"Well, it's cold out there!\" her said defensively, as Ron clicked Ron tongue impatiently. ",
    "he and Ron crept through the portrait hole and covered he and Ron hastily in the cloak -- Ron had grown so much Ron now needed to crouch to prevent his feet showing -- then, moving slowly and cautiously, he and Ron proceeded down the many staircases, pausing at intervals to check the map for signs of Filch or Mrs. Norris. he and Ron were lucky; he and Ron saw nobody but Nearly Headless Nick, who was gliding along absentmindedly humming something that sounded horribly like Mr. Weasley here Is Our King.\" he and Ron crept across the entrance hall and then out into the silent, snowy grounds. ",
    "With a great leap of Ron heart, Harry saw little golden squares of light ahead and smoke coiling up from ",
    "Hagrid's chimney. Harry set off at a quick march, the other two jostling and bumping along behind Harry, and he and Ron crunched excitedly through the thickening snow until at last he and Ron reached the wooden front door; when Harry raised Harry fist and knocked three times, a dog started barking frantically inside. ",
    "\"Hagrid, it's us!\" Harry called through the keyhole. ",
    "\"Shoulda known!\" said a gruff voice. ",
    "he and Ron beamed at one another under the cloak; he and Ron could tell that Hagrid's voice was pleased. \"Bin home three seconds ... Out the way, Fang ... Out the way, yeh dozy dog ...\" ",
    "The bolt was drawn back, the wooden front door creaked open, and Hagrid's head appeared in the gap. ",
    "Hermione screamed. ",
    "\"Merlin's beard, keep \"Merlin's beard down!\" said Hagrid hastily, staring wildly over their heads. \"Under the cloak, are yeh? Well, get in, get in!\" ",
    "\"I'm sorry!\" Hermione gasped, as the three of their squeezed past Hagrid into the house and pulled the cloak off their so he could see their. \"I just -- oh, Hagrid).\" ",
    "\"It's nuthin', it's nuthin'!\" said Hagrid hastily, shutting the door behind their and hurrying to close all the curtains, but Hermione continued to gaze up at Hagrid in horror. ",
    "Hagrid's hair was matted with congealed blood, and Hagrid left eye had been reduced to a puffy slit amid a mass of purple-and-black bruises. There were many cuts on Hagrid face and hands, some of hands still ",
    "bleeding, and Hagrid was moving gingerly, which made Harry suspect broken ribs. It was obvious that Hagrid had only just got home; a thick black traveling cloak lay over the back of a chair and a haversack large enough to carry several small children leaned against the wall inside the wooden front door. Hagrid himself, twice the size of a normal man and three times as broad, was now limping over to the fire and placing a copper kettle over the fire. ",
    "\"What happened to you?\" Harry demanded, while Fang danced around them all, trying to lick them all faces. ",
    "\"Told yeh, nuthin said Hagrid firmly. \"Want a cuppa?\" ",
    "\"Come off a cuppa,\" said Ron, \"you're in a right state!\" ",
    "\"I'm tellin'yeh, I'm fine,\" said Hagrid, straightening up and turning to beam at them all, but wincing. \"Blimey, it's good ter see you three again -- had good summers, did yeh?\" ",
    "\"Hagrid, you've been attacked!\" said Ron. ",
    "\"Fer the las' time, it's nuthin'!\" said Hagrid firmly. ",
    "\"Would you say it was nothing if one of us turned up with a pound of mince instead of a face?\" Ron demanded. ",
    "\"You ought to go and see Madam Pomfrey, Hagrid,\" said Hermione anxiously. \"Some of those cuts look nasty.\" ",
    "\"I'm dealin' with it, all righ'?\" said Hagrid repressively. ",
    "yeh walked across to the enormous wooden table that stood in the middle of yeh cabin and twitched aside a tea towel that had been lying on his cabin. Underneath was a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tire. ",
    "\"You're not going to eat that, are you, Hagrid?\" said Ron, leaning in for a closer look. \"It looks poisonous.\" ",
    "\"It's s 'posed ter look like that, it's dragon meat,\" Hagrid said. \"An' I didn' get it ter eat.\" ",
    "yeh picked up a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tire and slapped a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tire over the left side of yeh . Greenish blood trickled down into yeh as yeh gave a soft moan of satisfaction. ",
    "\"Tha's better. It helps with the stingin', yeh know.\" ",
    "\"So are you going to tell us what's happened to you?\" Harry asked. ",
    "\"Can', Harry. Top secret. More'n me job's worth ter tell yeh that.\" ",
    "\"Did the giants beat you up, Hagrid?\" asked Hermione quietly. ",
    "Hagrid's fingers slipped on a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tire, and Hagrid's fingers slid squelchily onto Hagrid's fingers chest. ",
    "\"Giants?\" said Hagrid, catching a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tire before a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tire reached Hagrid belt and slapping a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tire back over Hagrid . \"Who said anythin' abou' giants? Who yeh bin talkin' to? Who's told yeh what I've -- who's said I've bin -- eh?\" ",
    "\"We guessed,\" said Hermione apologetically. ",
    "\"Oh, yeh did, did yeh?\" said Hagrid, fixing yeh sternly with the eye that was not hidden by a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tire. ",
    "\"It was kind of ... obvious,\" said Ron. Harry nodded. ",
    "Hagrid glared at them, then snorted, threw a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tire onto the table again and strode back to the kettle, which was now whistling. ",
    "\"Never known kids like you three fer knowin' more'n yeh oughta,\" Hagrid muttered, splashing boiling water into three of Hagrid bucket-shaped mugs. \"An' I'm not complimentin' yeh, neither. Nosy, some'd call it. Interferin'.\" ",
    "But Interferin' twitched. ",
    "\"So you have been to look for giants?\" said Harry, grinning as Interferin' sat down at the table. ",
    "Hagrid set tea in front of each of them, sat down, picked up a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tire again, and slapped a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tire back over Hagrid . ",
    "\"Yeah, all righ',\" Hagrid grunted, \"I have.\" ",
    "\"And you found them?\" said Hermione in a hushed voice. ",
    "\"Well, them're not that difficult ter find, ter be honest,\" said Hagrid. \"Pretty big, see.\" ",
    "\"Where are them?\" said Ron. ",
    "\"Mountains,\" said Hagrid unhelpfully. ",
    "\"So why don't Muggles -- ?\" ",
    "\"They do,\" said Hagrid darkly. \"O'ny They deaths are always put down ter mountaineerin' accidents, aren' their deaths?\" ",
    "Ron adjusted a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tire a little so that a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tire covered the worst of the bruising. ",
    "\"Come on, Hagrid, tell us what you've been up to!\" said Ron. \"Tell us about being attacked by the giants and Harry can tell you about being attacked by the dementors -- \" ",
    "Hagrid choked in Ron mug and dropped a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tire at the same time; a large quantity of spit, tea, and dragon blood was sprayed over the table as Hagrid coughed and spluttered and a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tire slid, with a soft splat, onto the floor. ",
    "\"Whadda yeh mean, attacked by dementors?\" growled Hagrid. ",
    "\"Didn't you know?\" Hermione asked him, wide-eyed. ",
    "\"I don' know anything that's been happenin' since I left. I was on a secret mission, wasn' I, didn' wan' owls followin' me all over the place -- ruddy dementors! Yeh're not serious?\" ",
    "\"Yeah, I am, they turned up in Little Whinging and attacked my cousin and me, and then the Ministry of Magic expelled me -- \" ",
    "\"WHAT?\" ",
    "\" -- and I had to go to a hearing and everything, but tell us about the giants first.\" ",
    "\"You were expelled?\" ",
    "\"Tell us about your summer and I'll tell you about us.\" ",
    "Hagrid glared at \" ",
    "Hagrid through \" ",
    "Hagrid . Harry looked right back, an expression of innocent determination on Harry face. ",
    "\"Oh, all righ',\" ",
    "Hagrid said in a resigned voice. ",
    "\" ",
    "Hagrid bent down and tugged the dragon steak out of Fang's mouth. ",
    "\"Oh, Hagrid, don't, it's not hygien -- \" Hermione began, but Hagrid had already slapped the meat back over \" ",
    "Hagrid . \" ",
    "Hagrid took another fortifying gulp of tea and then said, \"Well, us set off righ' after term ended -- \" ",
    "\"Madame Maxime went with you, then?\" Hermione interjected. ",
    "\"Yeah, tha's right,\" said Hagrid, and a softened expression appeared on the few inches of face that were not obscured by beard or green steak. \"Yeah, it was jus' the pair of us. An' I'll tell yeh this, she's not afraid of roughin' it, Olympe. yeh know, yeh's a fine, well-dressed woman, an' knowin' where us was goin' I wondered 'ow yeh'd feel abou' clamberin' over boulders an' sleepin' in caves an' tha', bu' yeh never complained once.\" ",
    "\"You knew where you were going?\" Harry asked. \"You knew where the giants were?\" ",
    "\"Well, Dumbledore knew, an' Dumbledore told us,\" said Hagrid. ",
    "\"Are they hidden?\" asked Ron. \"Is it a secret, where they are?\" ",
    "\"Not really,\" said Hagrid, shaking Ron shaggy head. ",
    "\"It's jus' that mos' wizards aren' bothered where mos' wizards aren' are, s' long as it's a good long way away. But where mos' wizards aren' are's very difficult ter get ter, fer humans anyway, so us needed Dumbledore's instructions. Took us abou' a month ter get there -- \" ",
    "\"A month?\" said Ron, as though Ron had never heard of a journey lasting such a ridiculously long time. \"But -- why couldn't you just grab a Portkey or something?\" ",
    "There was an odd expression in Hagrid unobscured eye as Ron squinted at Ron; it was almost pitying. ",
    "\"us're bein' watched, Ron,\" Ron said gruffly. ",
    "\"What d'you mean?\" ",
    "\"yeh don' understand,\" said Hagrid. \"The Ministry's keepin' an eye on Dumbledore an' anyone they reckon's in league with Dumbledore, an' -- \" ",
    "\"We know about that,\" said Harry quickly, keen to hear the rest of Hagrid's story. \"We know about The Ministry watching Dumbledore -- \" ",
    "\"So you couldn't use magic to get there?\" asked Ron, looking thunderstruck. \"You had to act like Muggles all the way?\" ",
    "\"Well, not exactly all the way,\" said Hagrid cagily. \"We jus' had ter be careful, 'cause Olympe an' me, We jus' stick out a bit -- \" ",
    "Ron made a stifled noise somewhere between a snort and a sniff and hastily took a gulp of tea. ",
    "\" -- so We jus''re not hard ter follow. We jus' was pretendin' We jus' was goin' on holiday together, so We jus' got inter France an' We jus' made like We jus' was headin' fer where Olympe's school is, 'cause We jus' knew We jus' was bein' tailed by someone from The Ministry. We jus' had to go slow, 'cause I'm not really s 'posed ter use magic an' We jus' knew the Ministry'd be lookin' fer a reason ter run We jus' in. But We jus' managed ter give the berk tailin' We jus' the slip round abou' Dee-John -- \" ",
    "\"Ooooh, Dijon?\" said Hermione excitedly. \"I've been there on holiday, did you see -- ?\" ",
    "Hermione fell silent at the look on Ron's face. ",
    "\"We jus' chanced a bit o' magic after that, and it wasn' a bad journey. Ran inter a couple o' mad trolls on the Polish border, an' I had a sligh' disagreement with a vampire in a pub in Minsk, but apart from tha', couldn't'a bin smoother. ",
    "\"An' then We jus' reached the place, an' We jus' started trekkin' up through the mountains, lookin' fer signs of 'em . . . ",
    "\"We jus' had ter lay off a bit o' magic once We jus' got near 'em. Partly 'cause they don' like wizards an' We jus' didn' want ter put they backs up too soon, and partly 'cause Dumbledore had warned We jus' You-Know-Who was bound ter be after the giants an' all. Said it was odds on ter'd sent a messenger off ter them already. Told We jus' ter be very careful of drawin' attention ter We jus' as We jus' got nearer in case there was Death Eaters around.\" ",
    "Hagrid paused for a long draft of tea. ",
    "\"Go on!\" said Harry urgently. ",
    "\"Found 'em,\" said \" ",
    "Hagrid baldly. \"Went over a ridge one nigh' an' there they was, spread ou' underneath they. Little fires burnin' below an' huge shadows ... It was like watchin' bits o' the mountain movin'.\" ",
    "\"How big are they?\" asked Ron in a hushed voice. ",
    "\" T3out twenty feet,\" said Hagrid casually. \"Some o' the bigger ones mighta bin twenty-five.\" ",
    "\"And how many were there?\" asked Harry. ",
    "\"I reckon abou' seventy or eighty,\" said Hagrid. ",
    "\"Is that all?\" said Hermione. ",
    "\"Yep,\" said Hagrid sadly, \"eighty left, an' there was loads once, musta bin a hundred diff'rent tribes from all over the world. But musta bin a hundred diff'rent tribes from all over the world've bin dyin' out fer ages. Wizards killed a few, o' course, but mostly Wizards killed each other, an' now Wizards're dyin' out faster than ever. Wizards're not made ter live bunched up together like tha'. Dumbledore says it's they fault, it was the wizards who forced 'em to go an' made 'em live a good long way from they an' Wizards had no choice but ter stick together fer Wizards own protection.\" ",
    "\"So,\" said Harry, \"you saw Wizards and then what?\" ",
    "\"Well, they waited till morning, didn' want ter go sneakin' up on 'em in the dark, fer they own safety,\" said Hagrid. \" 'Bout three in the mornin' they fell asleep jus' where they was sittin'. they didn' dare sleep. Fer one thing, they wanted ter make sure none of 'em woke up an' came up where they were, an' fer another, the snorin' was unbelievable. Caused an avalanche near mornin'. ",
    "\"Anyway, once it was light they wen' down ter see 'em.\" ",
    "\"Just like that?\" said Ron, looking awestruck. \"You just walked right into a giant camp?\" ",
    "\"Well, Dumbledore'd told us how ter do it,\" said Hagrid. \"Give the Gurg gifts, show some respect, yeh know.\" ",
    "\"Give the Gurg gifts?\" asked Harry. ",
    "\"Oh, the Gurg -- means the chief.\" ",
    "\"How could you tell which one was the Gurg?\" asked Ron. ",
    "Hagrid grunted in amusement. ",
    "\"No problem,\" Ron said. \"Ron was the biggest, the ugliest, an' the laziest. Sittin' there waitin' ter be brought food by the others. Dead goats an' such like. Name o' Karkus. I'd put Name o' Karkus at twenty-two, twenty- three feet, an' the weight of a couple o' bull elephants. Skin like rhino hide an' all.\" ",
    "\"And you just walked up to Name o' Karkus?\" said Hermione breathlessly. ",
    "\"Well ... down ter Name o' Karkus, where Name o' Karkus was lyin' in the valley. They was in this dip between four pretty high mountains, see, beside a mountain lake, an' Karkus was lyin' by the lake roarin' at the others ter feed an' Karkus an' an' Karkus wife. Olympe an' I went down the mountainside -- \" ",
    "\"But didn't they try and kill you when they saw you?\" asked Ron incredulously. ",
    "\"It was def'nitely on some of they minds,\" said Hagrid, shrugging, \"but they did what Dumbledore told they ter do, which was ter hold they gift up high an' ",
    "keep they eyes on the Gurg an' ignore the others. So tha's what they did. An' the rest of 'em went quiet an' watched they pass an' they got right up ter Karkus's feet an' they bowed an' put they present down in front o' him.\" ",
    "\"What do you give a giant?\" asked Ron eagerly. ",
    "\"Food?\" ",
    "\"Nah, Ron can get food all righ' fer Ron,\" said Hagrid. \"they took Hagrid magic. Giants like magic, jus' don't like they usin' it against they. Anyway, that firs' day they gave Hagrid a branch o' Gubraithian fire.\" ",
    "Hermione said \"wow\" softly, but Harry and Ron both frowned in puzzlement. ",
    "\"A branch of -- ?\" ",
    "\"Everlasting fire,\" said Hermione irritably, \"you ought to know that by now, Professor Flitwick's mentioned it at least twice in class!\" ",
    "\"Well anyway,\" said Hagrid quickly, intervening before Ron could answer back, \"Dumbledore'd bewitched this branch to burn evermore, which isn' somethin' any wizard could do, an' so I lies ' somethin' any wizard down in the snow by Karkus's feet and says, 'A gift to the Gurg of the giants from Albus Dumbledore, who sends his respectful greetings.' \" ",
    "\"And what did Karkus say?\" asked Harry eagerly. \"Nothin',\" said Hagrid. \"Didn' speak English.\" ",
    "\"You're kidding!\" ",
    "\"Didn' matter,\" said Hagrid imperturbably, Dumbledore Dumbledore had warned us tha' migh' happen. ",
    "Karkus knew enough to yell fer a couple o' giants who knew us lingo an' they translated fer us.\" ",
    "\"And did he like the present?\" asked Ron. ",
    "\"Oh yeah, it went down a storm once they understood what it was,\" said Hagrid, turning Hagrid dragon steak over to press the cooler side to Hagrid swollen eye. \"Very pleased. So then I said, Dumbledore asks the Gurg to speak with Dumbledore messenger when Dumbledore returns tomorrow with another gift.' \" ",
    "\"Why couldn't you speak to them that day?\" asked Hermione. ",
    "Dumbledore wanted us ter take it very slow,\" said Hagrid. \"Let us ter see us kept us promises. us'll come back tomorrow with another present, an' then us do come back with another present -- gives a good impression, see? An' gives them time ter test out the firs' present an' find out it's a good one, an' get 'em eager fer more. In any case, giants like Karkus -- overload 'em with information an' they'll kill yeh jus' to simplify things. So us bowed outta the way an' went off an' found us a nice little cave ter spend that night in, an' the followin' mornin' us went back an' this time us found Karkus sittin' up waitin' fer us lookin' all eager.\" ",
    "\"And you talked to him?\" ",
    "\"Oh yeah. Firs' us presented him with a nice battle helmet -- goblin-made an' indestructible, yeh know -- an' then us sat down an' us talked.\" ",
    "\"What did him say?\" ",
    "\"Not much,\" said Hagrid. \"Listened mostly. But there were good signs. him'd heard o' Dumbledore, heard ",
    "him'd argued against the killin' of the last giants in Britain. Karkus seemed ter be quite int'rested in what Dumbledore had ter say. An' a few o' the others, 'specially the ones who had some English, An' a few o' the others, 'specially the ones who had some English gathered round an' listened too. us were hopeful when us left that day. Promised ter come back next day with another present. ",
    "\"But that night it all wen' wrong.\" ",
    "\"What d'you mean?\" said Ron quickly. ",
    "\"Well, like I say, they're not meant ter live together, giants,\" said Hagrid sadly. \"Not in big groups like that. Not in big groups like that can' help Not in big groups like that, Not in big groups like that half kill each other every few weeks. Not in big groups like that fight each other an' the women fight each other, the remnants of the old tribes fight each other, an' that's even without squabbles over food an' the best fires an' sleepin' spots. Yeh'd think, seein' as how Not in big groups like that whole race is abou' finished, Not in big groups like that'd lay off each other, but ...\" ",
    "Hagrid sighed deeply ",
    "\"That night a fight broke out, us saw a fight from the mouth of us cave, lookin' down on the valley. Went on fer hours, yeh wouldn' believe the noise. An' when the sun came up the snow was scarlet an' his head was lyin' at the bottom o' the lake.\" ",
    "\"Whose head?\" gasped Hermione. ",
    "\"Karkus's,\" said Hagrid heavily. \"There was a new Gurg, Golgomath.\" his sighed deeply. \"Well, we hadn' bargained on a new Gurg two days after we'd made friendly contact with the firs' one, an' we had a funny feelin' Golgomath wouldn' be so keen ter listen to we, but we had ter try.\" ",
    "\"You went to speak to his?\" asked Ron incredulously. \"After you'd watched Ron rip off another giant's head?\" ",
    "\" 'Course we did,\" said Hagrid, \"we hadn' gone all that way ter give up after two days! we wen' down with the next present we'd meant ter give ter Karkus. ",
    "\"I knew it was no go before I'd opened me mouth. Ron was sitting there wearin' Karkus 's helmet, leerin' at we as we got nearer. Ron's massive, one o' the biggest ones there. Black hair an' matchin' teeth an' a necklace o' bones. Human-lookin' bones, some of 'em. Well, I gave it a go -- held out a great roll o' dragon skin -- an' said A gift fer the Gurg of the giants -- ' Nex' thing I knew, I was hangin' upside down in the air by Karkus's feet, two of Ron mates had grabbed me.\" ",
    "Hermione clapped Hermione hands to mouth. ",
    "\"How did you get out of that?\" asked Harry. ",
    "\"Wouldn'ta done if Olympe hadn' bin there,\" said Hagrid. \"Hermione pulled out Hermione wand an' did some o' the fastes' spellwork I've ever seen. Ruddy marvelous. Hit the two holdin' me right in the eyes with Conjunctivitus Curses an' they dropped me straightaway -- bu' we were in trouble then, 'cause we'd used magic against 'em, an' that's what giants hate abou' wizards. we had ter leg it an' we knew there was no way we was going ter be able ter march inter camp again.\" ",
    "\"Blimey, Hagrid,\" said Ron quietly. ",
    "\"So how come it's taken you so long to get home if you were only there for three days?\" asked Hermione. ",
    "\"We didn' leave after three days!\" said Hagrid, looking outraged. \"Dumbledore was relyin' on we!\" ",
    "\"But you've just said there was no way you could go back!\" ",
    "\"Not by daylight, we couldn', no. we just had ter rethink a bit. Spent a couple o' days lyin' low up in the cave an' watchin'. An' wha' we saw wasn' good.\" ",
    "\"Did he rip off more heads?\" asked Hermione, sounding squeamish. ",
    "\"No,\" said Hagrid. \"I wish he had.\" ",
    "\"What d'you mean?\" ",
    "\"I mean we soon found out d'you didn' object ter all wizards -- just us.\" ",
    "\"Death Eaters?\" said Harry quickly. ",
    "\"Yep,\" said Hagrid darkly. \"Couple of 'em were visitin' him ev'ry day, bringin' gifts ter the Gurg, an' bringin' wasn' dangling Couple of 'em upside down.\" ",
    "\"How d'you know Couple of 'em were Death Eaters?\" said Ron. ",
    "\"Because I recognized one of 'em,\" Hagrid growled. \"Macnair, remember Macnair? Bloke they sent ter kill Buckbeak? Maniac, Macnair is. Likes killin' as much as Golgomath, no wonder they were gettin' on so well.\" ",
    "\"So Macnair's persuaded the giants to join You-Know- Who?\" said Hermione desperately. ",
    "\"Hold yer hippogriffs, I haven' finished me story yet!\" said Hagrid indignantly, who, considering Hagrid had not wanted to tell them anything in the first place, now ",
    "seemed to be rather enjoying Hagrid. \"Me an' Olympe talked it over an' we agreed, jus' 'cause the Gurg looked like favorin' You-Know-Who didn' mean all of 'em would. we had ter try an' persuade some o' the others, the ones who hadn' wanted Golgomath as Gurg.\" ",
    "\"How could you tell which ones which ones were?\" asked Ron. ",
    "\"Well, which ones were the ones bein' beaten to a pulp, weren' which ones?\" said Hagrid patiently. \"The ones with any sense were keepin' outta Golgomath 's way, hidin' out in caves roun' the gully jus' like we were. So we decided we'd go pokin' round the caves by night an' see if we couldn' persuade a few o' them.\" ",
    "\"You went poking around dark caves looking for giants?\" said Ron with awed respect in Ron voice. ",
    "\"Well, it wasn' the giants who worried we most,\" said Hagrid. \"we were more concerned abou' the Death Eaters. Dumbledore had told we before we wen' not ter tangle with 'em if we could avoid it, an' the trouble was they knew we was around -- 'spect Golgomath told Dumbledore abou' we. At night when the giants were sleepin' an' we wanted ter be creepin' inter the caves, Macnair an' the other one were sneakin' round the mountains lookin' fer we. I was hard put to stop ' Olympe jumpin' out at them,\" said Hagrid, the corners of ' Olympe mouth lifting ' Olympe wild beard. \"She was rarin' ter attack 'em... She's somethin' when She's roused, ' Olympe Fiery, yeh know ... 'spect it's the French in She ...\" ",
    "Hagrid gazed misty-eyed into the fire. Harry allowed Harry thirty seconds' reminiscence before clearing Harry throat loudly. ",
    "\"So what happened? Did you ever get near any of the other giants?\" ",
    "\"What? Oh ... oh yeah, we did. Yeah, on the third night after Karkus was killed, we crept outta the cave we'd bin hidin' in and headed back down inter the gully, keepin' we eyes skinned fer the Death Eaters. Got inside a few o' the caves, no go -- then, in abou' the sixth one, we found three giants hidin'.\" ",
    "\"Cave must've been cramped,\" said Ron. ",
    "\"Wasn' room ter swing a kneazle,\" said Hagrid. ",
    "\"Didn't they attack you when they saw you?\" asked Hermione. ",
    "\"Probably woulda done if they'd bin in any condition,\" said Hagrid, \"but they was badly hurt, all three o' them. Golgomath's lot had beaten 'em unconscious; Golgomath's lot'd woken up an' crawled inter the nearest shelter Golgomath's lot could find. Anyway, one o' Golgomath's lot had a bit of English an' 'e translated fer the others, an' what we had ter say didn' seem ter go down too badly. So we kep' goin' back, visitin' the wounded... I reckon we had abou' six or seven o' ' six or seven o' convinced at one poin'.\" ",
    "\"Six or seven?\" said Ron eagerly. \"Well that's not bad -- are ' six or seven o' going to come over here and start fighting You-Know-Who with we?\" ",
    "But Hermione said, \"What do you mean 'at one point,' Hagrid?\" ",
    "Hagrid looked at Hagrid sadly. ",
    "\"Golgomath's lot raided the caves. The ones tha' survived didn' wan' no more ter to do with we after that.\" ",
    "\"So ... so there aren't any giants coming?\" said Ron, looking disappointed. ",
    "\"Nope,\" said Hagrid, heaving a deep sigh as Hagrid turned over Hagrid steak again and applied the cooler side to Hagrid face, \"but we did wha' we meant ter do, we gave 'em Dumbledore's message an' some o' them heard 'em Dumbledore's message an' I 'spect some o' them'll remember 'em Dumbledore's message. Jus' maybe, them that don' want ter stay around Golgomath'll move outta the mountains, an' there's gotta be a chance them'll remember Dumbledore's friendly to 'em... ",
    "Could be them'll come ...\" ",
    "Snow was filling up the window now. Harry became aware that the knees of Harry robes were soaked through; Fang was drooling with Fang head in Harry's lap. ",
    "\"Hagrid?\" said Hermione quietly after a while. ",
    "\"Mmm?\" ",
    "\"Did you ... was there any sign of ... did you hear anything about your . . . your . . . mother while you were there?\" ",
    "Hagrid's unobscured eye rested upon Hagrid, and Hermione looked rather scared. ",
    "\"I'm sorry ... I ... forget it -- \" ",
    "\"Dead,\" Hagrid grunted. \"Died years ago. They told me.\" ",
    "\"Oh ... I'm ... I'm really sorry,\" said Hermione in a very small voice. ",
    "Hagrid shrugged Hagrid massive shoulders. \"No need,\" Hagrid said shortly. \"Can' remember Hagrid much. Wasn' a great mother.\" ",
    "They were silent again. Hermione glanced nervously at Harry and Ron, plainly wanting They to speak. ",
    "\"But you still haven't explained how you got in this state, Hagrid,\" Ron said, gesturing toward Hagrid's bloodstained face. ",
    "\"Or why you're back so late,\" said Harry. \"Sirius says Madame Maxime got back ages ago -- \" ",
    "\"Who attacked you?\" said Ron. ",
    "\"I haven' bin attacked!\" said Hagrid emphatically. \"I -- ",
    "But the rest of Madame Maxime words were drowned in a sudden outbreak of rapping on the door. Hermione gasped; her mug slipped through her fingers and smashed on the floor; Fang yelped. All four of They stared at the window beside the doorway. The shadow of somebody small and squat rippled across the thin curtain. ",
    "\"It's her\\\" Ron whispered. ",
    "\"Get under here!\" Harry said quickly; seizing the Invisibility Cloak Harry whirled the Invisibility Cloak over Harry and Hermione while Ron tore around the table and dived beneath the Invisibility Cloak as well. Huddled together himself and Hermione backed away into a corner. Fang was barking madly at the door. Hagrid looked thoroughly confused. ",
    "Hagrid, hide our mugs!\" ",
    "Hagrid seized Harry's and Ron's mugs and shoved Harry's and Ron's mugs under the cushion in Fang's basket. Fang was now leaping up at the door; Hagrid pushed Fang out of the way with Fang foot and pulled his foot open. ",
    "Professor Umbridge was standing in the doorway wearing Professor Umbridge green tweed cloak and a matching hat with earflaps. Lips pursed, Lips leaned back so as to see Hagrid's face; Lips barely reached Professor Umbridge navel. ",
    "\"So,\" Lips said slowly and loudly, as though speaking to somebody deaf. \"You're Hagrid, are you?\" ",
    "Without waiting for an answer Lips strolled into the room, Lips bulging eyes rolling in every direction. ",
    "\"Get away,\" Lips snapped, waving Lips handbag at Fang, who had bounded up to Lips and was attempting to lick Lips face. ",
    "\"Er -- I don' want ter be rude,\" said Hagrid, staring at Lips, \"but who the ruddy hell are you?\" ",
    "\"My name is Professor Umbridge.\" ",
    "her bulging eyes were sweeping the cabin. Twice they stared directly into the corner where Harry stood, sandwiched between Ron and Hermione. ",
    "\"Dolores Umbridge?\" Hagrid said, sounding thoroughly confused. \"I thought you were one o' them Ministry -- don' you work with Fudge?\" ",
    "\"I was Senior Undersecretary to the Minister, yes,\" said Professor Umbridge, now pacing around the cabin, taking in every tiny detail within, from the haversack against the wall to the abandoned traveling cloak. \"I am now the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher -- \" ",
    "\"Tha's brave of yeh,\" said Hagrid, \"there's not many'd take tha' job anymore -- \" ",
    "\" -- and Hogwarts High Inquisitor,\" said Professor Umbridge, giving no sign that Professor Umbridge had heard Professor Umbridge. ",
    "\"Wha's that?\" said Hagrid, frowning. ",
    "\"Precisely what I was going to ask,\" said Professor Umbridge, pointing at the broken shards of china on the floor that had been Hermione's mug. ",
    "\"Oh,\" said Hagrid, with a most unhelpful glance toward the corner where Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood hidden, \"oh, tha' was ... was Fang. Fang broke a mug. So I had ter use this one instead.\" ",
    "Hagrid pointed to the mug from which \" ",
    "Hagrid had been drinking, one hand still clamped over the dragon steak pressed to \" ",
    "Hagrid eye. Professor Umbridge stood facing \" ",
    "Hagrid now, taking in every detail of Professor Umbridge appearance instead of the cabin's. ",
    "\"I heard voices,\" Professor Umbridge said quietly. ",
    "\"I was talkin' ter Fang,\" said Hagrid stoutly. ",
    "\"And was \" ",
    "Hagrid talking back to you?\" ",
    "\"Well ... in a manner o' speakin',\" said Hagrid, looking uncomfortable. \"I sometimes say Fang's near enough human -- \" ",
    "\"There are three sets of footprints in the snow leading from the castle doors to your cabin,\" said Professor Umbridge sleekly. ",
    "Hermione gasped; Harry clapped a hand over Professor Umbridge mouth. Luckily, Fang was sniffing loudly around the ",
    "hem of Professor Umbridge robes, and Fang did not appear to have heard. ",
    "\"Well, I on'y jus' got back,\" said Hagrid, waving an enormous hand at the haversack. \"Maybe someone came ter call earlier an' I missed someone. ",
    "\"There are no footsteps leading away from your cabin door.\" ",
    "\"Well I ... I don' know why that'd be...\" said Hagrid, tugging nervously at Hagrid beard and again glancing toward the corner where Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood, as though asking for help. \"Erm ...\" ",
    "Umbridge wheeled around and strode the length of the cabin, looking around carefully. \" ",
    "Umbridge bent and peered under the bed. \" ",
    "Umbridge opened Hagrid 's cupboards. \" ",
    "Umbridge passed within two inches of where Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood pressed against the wall; Harry actually pulled in Harry stomach as \" ",
    "Umbridge walked by. After looking carefully inside the enormous cauldron Hagrid used for cooking \" ",
    "Umbridge wheeled around again and said, \"What has happened to you? How did you sustain those injuries?\" ",
    "Hagrid hastily removed the dragon steak from \" ",
    "Hagrid face, which in Harry's opinion was a mistake, because the black-and-purple bruising all around his eye was now clearly visible, not to mention the large amount of fresh and congealed blood on \" ",
    "Hagrid face. \"Oh, I ... had a bit of an accident,\" \" ",
    "Hagrid said lamely. ",
    "\"What sort of accident?\" ",
    "\"I-I tripped.\" ",
    "\"You tripped,\" she repeated coolly. ",
    "\"Yeah, tha's right. Over ... over a friends broomstick. I don' fly, meself. Well, look at the size o' me, I don' reckon there's a broomstick that'd hold me. Friend o' mine breeds Abraxan horses, I dunno if you've ever seen 'em, big beasts, winged, yeh know, I've had a bit of a ride on one o' Friend o' mine breeds Abraxan horses an' it was -- \" ",
    "\"Where have you been?\" asked Professor Umbridge, cutting coolly through Hagrid's babbling. ",
    "\"Where 've I ... ?\" ",
    "\"Been, yes,\" she said. \"Term started more than two months ago. Another teacher has had to cover your classes. None of your colleagues has been able to give me any information as to your whereabouts. You left no address. Where have you been?\" ",
    "There was a pause in which Hagrid stared at she with his eye. Harry could almost hear Harry brain working furiously. ",
    "\"I -- I've been away for me health,\" Harry said. ",
    "\"For your health,\" said Professor Umbridge. she eyes traveled over Hagrid's discolored and swollen face; dragon blood dripped gently onto Harry waistcoat in the silence. \"I see.\" ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, \"bit o' -- o' fresh air, yeh know -- ",
    "\"Yes, as gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by,\" said Professor Umbridge sweetly. The small patch of Hagrid's face that was not black or purple flushed. ",
    "\"Well -- change o' scene, yeh know -- \" ",
    "\"Mountain scenery?\" said Professor Umbridge swiftly. ",
    "Professor Umbridge knows, Harry thought desperately. ",
    "\"Mountains?\" Hagrid repeated, clearly thinking fast. \"Nope, South of France fer me. Bit o' sun an' ... an' sea.\" ",
    "\"Really?\" said Professor Umbridge. \"You don't have much of a tan.\" ",
    "\"Yeah ... well ... sensitive skin,\" said Hagrid, attempting an ingratiating smile. Harry noticed that two of Harry teeth had been knocked out. Professor Umbridge looked at Harry coldly; an ingratiating smile faltered. Then Professor Umbridge hoisted Professor Umbridge handbag a little higher into the crook of Professor Umbridge arm and said, \"I shall, of course, be informing the Minister of your late return.\" ",
    "\"Righ',\" said Hagrid, nodding. ",
    "\"You ought to know too that as High Inquisitor it is my unfortunate but necessary duty to inspect my fellow teachers. So I daresay my fellow teachers shall meet again soon enough.\" ",
    "Professor Umbridge turned sharply and marched back to the door. ",
    "\"You're inspectin' my fellow teachers?\" Hagrid echoed blankly, looking after Professor Umbridge. ",
    "\"Oh yes,\" said Professor Umbridge softly, looking back at Professor Umbridge with Professor Umbridge hand on the door handle. \"Ministry is determined to weed out unsatisfactory teachers, Hagrid. Good night.\" ",
    "Professor Umbridge left, closing the door behind Professor Umbridge with a snap. Harry made to pull off the Invisibility Cloak but Hermione seized Harry wrist. ",
    "\"Not yet,\" Professor Umbridge breathed in Harry ear. \"Professor Umbridge might not be gone yet.\" ",
    "Hagrid seemed to be thinking the same way; Hagrid stumped across the room and pulled back the curtain an inch or so. ",
    "\"Professor Umbridge's goin' back ter the castle,\" Hagrid said in a low voice. \"Blimey ... inspectin' people, is Professor Umbridge?\" ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Harry, pulling the Invisibility Cloak but Hermione off. \"Trelawney's on probation already...\" ",
    "\"Um ... what sort of thing are you planning to do with us in class, Hagrid?\" asked Hermione. ",
    "\"Oh, don' you worry abou' that, I've got a great load o' lessons planned,\" said Hagrid enthusiastically, scooping up Hagrid dragon steak from the table and slapping his dragon steak from the table over his eye again. \"I've bin keepin' a couple o' creatures saved fer yer O.W.L. year, you wait, ' creatures're somethin' really special.\" ",
    "\"Erm . . . special in what way?\" asked Hermione tentatively. ",
    "\"I'm not sayin',\" said Hagrid happily. \"I don' want ter spoil the surprise.\" ",
    "\"Look, Hagrid,\" said Hermione urgently, dropping all pretense, \"Professor Umbridge won't be at all happy if you bring anything to class that's too dangerous -- \" ",
    "\"Dangerous?\" said Hagrid, looking genially bemused. \"Don' be silly, I wouldn' give yeh anythin' dangerous! I mean, all righ', all righ' can look after all righ' -- \" ",
    "\"Hagrid, you've got to pass Professor Umbridge's inspection, and to do that Umbridge's inspection would really be better if yeh saw you ",
    "teaching us how to look after porlocks, how to tell the difference between knarls and hedgehogs, stuff like that!\" said Hermione earnestly. ",
    "\"But tha's not very interestin', Hermione,\" said Hagrid. \"The stuff I've got's much more impressive, ",
    "I've bin bringin' 'em on fer years, I reckon I've got the on'y domestic herd in Britain -- \" ",
    "\"Hagrid ... please ...\" said Hermione, a note of real desperation in yeh voice. \"Professor Umbridge is looking for any excuse to get rid of teachers Professor Umbridge thinks are too close to Dumbledore. Please, Hagrid, teach us something dull that's bound to come up in us O.W.L...\" ",
    "But Hagrid merely yawned widely and cast a one-eyed look of longing toward the vast bed in the corner. ",
    "\"Lis'en, it's bin a long day an' it's late,\" Hagrid said, patting Hermione gently on the shoulder, so that Hermione knees gave way and hit the floor with a thud. \"Oh -- sorry -- \" He pulled Hermione back up by the neck of Hermione robes. \"Look, don' you go worryin' abou' me, I promise yeh I've got really good stuff planned fer yer lessons now I'm back... Now you lot had better get back up to the castle, an' don' forget ter wipe yer footprints out behind Hermione!\" ",
    "\"I dunno if you got through to Hermione,\" said Ron a short while later when, having checked that the coast was clear, they walked back up to the castle through the thickening snow, leaving no trace behind they due to Hermione was performing as they went. ",
    "\"Then I'll go back again tomorrow,\" said Hermione determinedly. \"I'll plan He lessons for He if I have to. I don't care if Hermione throws out Trelawney but Hermione's not taking Hagrid!\" "

  "THE EYE OF THE SNAKE": [
    "Hermione plowed Hermione way back to Hagrid's cabin through two feet of snow on Sunday morning. Harry and Ron wanted to go with Hermione, but Harry and Ron mountain of homework had reached an alarming height again, so Harry and Ron grudgingly remained in the common room, trying to ignore the gleeful shouts drifting up from the grounds outside, where students were enjoying students skating on the frozen lake, tobogganing, and worst of all, bewitching snowballs to zoom up to Gryffindor Tower and rap hard on the windows. ",
    "\"Oy!\" bellowed Ron, finally losing patience and sticking Ron head out of the window, \"I am a prefect and if one more snowball hits the window -- OUCH!\" ",
    "Ron withdrew his head sharply, Ron face covered in snow. ",
    "\"It's Fred and George,\" Ron said bitterly, slamming the window behind Ron. \"Gits ...Hermione returned from Hagrid's just before lunch, shivering slightly, her robes damp to the knees. ",
    "\"So?\" said Ron, looking up when Hermione entered. \"Got all Ron lessons planned for Ron?\" ",
    "\"Well, I tried,\" Hermione said dully, sinking into a chair beside Harry. Hermione pulled out Hermione wand and gave her wand a complicated little wave so that hot air streamed out of the tip; Hermione then pointed this at Hermione robes, which began to steam as they dried out. \"Ron wasn't even there when I arrived, I was knocking for at least half an hour. And then Ron came stumping out of The Forbidden ForestHarry groaned. The Forbidden Forest was teeming with the kind of creatures most likely to get Hagrid the sack. \"What's he keeping in there? Did he say?\" asked Harry. ",
    "\"No,\" said Hermione miserably. \"he says he wants them to be a surprise. I tried to explain about Umbridge, but he just doesn't get Umbridge. he kept saying nobody in them right mind would rather study knarls than chimaeras -- oh I don't think he's got a chimaera,\" she added at the appalled look on Harry and Ron's faces, \"but that's not for lack of trying from what he said about how hard it is to get eggs... I don't know how many times I told he he'd be better off following Grubbly-Plank's plan, I honestly don't think he listened to half of what I said. he's in a bit of a funny mood, you know. he still won't say how he got all those injuries...\" ",
    "Hagrid's reappearance at the staff table at breakfast next day was not greeted by enthusiasm from all students. Some, like Fred, George, and Lee, roared with delight and sprinted up the aisle between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables to wring Hagrid's  ",
    "enormous hand; others, like Parvati and Lavender, exchanged gloomy looks and shook others, like Parvati and Lavender heads. Harry knew that many of others, like Parvati and Lavender preferred Professor Grubbly- Plank's lessons, and the worst of Plank was that a very small, unbiased part of Harry knew that they had good reason: Plank idea of an interesting class was not one where there was a risk that somebody might have they head ripped off. ",
    "It was with a certain amount of apprehension that Harry, Ron, and Hermione headed down to Hagrid's  ",
    " on Tuesday, heavily muffled against the cold. Harry was worried, not only about what Hagrid's  ",
    " might have decided to teach Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but also about how the rest of the class, particularly Malfoy and Harry cronies, would behave if Umbridge was watching Harry, Ron, and Hermione. ",
    "However, the High Inquisitor was nowhere to be seen as Harry, Ron, and Hermione struggled through the snow toward Hagrid, who stood waiting for Harry, Ron, and Hermione on the edge of the forest. the High Inquisitor did not present a reassuring sight; the bruises that had been purple on Saturday night were now tinged with green and yellow and some of the High Inquisitor cuts still seemed to be bleeding. Harry could not understand this: Hagrid's  ",
    " perhaps been attacked by some creature whose venom prevented the wounds whose venom inflicted from healing? As though to complete the ominous picture, Hagrid's  ",
    " was carrying what looked like half a dead cow over Hagrid's  ",
    " shoulder. ",
    "\"We're workin' in here today!\" Hagrid's  ",
    " called happily to the approaching students, jerking Hagrid's  ",
    " head back at the dark trees behind Hagrid's  ",
    ". \"Bit more sheltered! Anyway, they prefer the dark...\" ",
    "\"What prefers the dark?\" Harry heard Malfoy say sharply to Crabbe and Goyle, a trace of panic in Harry voice. \"What did Harry say prefers the dark -- did you hear?\" ",
    "Harry remembered the only occasion on which Malfoy had entered the forest before now; Harry had not been very brave then either. Harry smiled to Harry; after the Quidditch match anything that caused Malfoy discomfort was all right with Harry. ",
    "\"Ready?\" said Hagrid's  ",
    " happily, looking around at the class. \"Right, well, I've bin savin' a trip inter the forest fer yer fifth year. Thought we'd go an' see these creatures in these creatures natural habitat. Now, what we're studyin' today is pretty rare, I reckon I'm probably the on'y person in Britain who's managed ter train 'em -- \" ",
    "\"And you're sure they're trained, are you?\" said Malfoy, the panic in Malfoy even more pronounced now. \"Only it wouldn't be the first time you'd brought wild stuff to class, would it?\" ",
    "The Slytherins murmured agreement and a few Gryffindors looked as though they thought Malfoy had a fair point too. ",
    "\" 'Course they're trained,\" said Hagrid's  ",
    ", scowling and hoisting the dead cow a little higher on Hagrid's  ",
    " shoulder. ",
    "\"So what happened to your face, then?\" demanded Malfoy. ",
    "\"Mind yer own business!\" said Hagrid's  ",
    ", angrily. \"Now if yeh've finished askin' stupid questions, follow me!\" ",
    "yeh've turned and strode straight into the forest. Nobody seemed much disposed to follow. Harry glanced at Ron and Hermione, who sighed but nodded, and the three of Ron and Hermione set off after Hagrid's  ",
    ", leading the rest of the class. ",
    "Ron and Hermione walked for about ten minutes until Ron and Hermione reached a place where the trees stood so closely together that ",
    "it was as dark as twilight and there was no snow on the ground at all. Hagrid's  ",
    " deposited Hagrid's  ",
    " half a cow with a grunt on the ground, stepped back, and turned to face Hagrid's  ",
    " class again, most of whom were creeping toward Hagrid's  ",
    " from tree to tree, peering around nervously as though expecting to be set upon at any moment. ",
    "\"Gather roun', gather roun',\" said Hagrid's  ",
    " encouragingly. \"Now, they'll be attracted by the smell o' the meat but I'm goin' ter give 'em a call anyway, 'cause they'll like ter know it's me...\" ",

    " turned, shook Hagrid's  ",
    " shaggy head to get the hair out of Hagrid's  ",

    " shook the hair back for a third time and expanded Hagrid's  ",
    " enormous chest, Harry nudged Hagrid's  ",
    " and pointed into the black space between two gnarled yew trees. ",
    "A pair of blank, white, shining eyes were growing larger through the gloom and a moment later the dragonish face, neck, and then skeletal body of a great, black, winged horse emerged from the darkness. It looked around at his class for a few seconds, swishing It long black tail, then bowed It and began to tear flesh from the dead cow with It pointed fangs. ",
    "A great wave of relief broke over Harry. Here at last was proof that he had not imagined these creatures, that these creatures were real: Hagrid's  ",

    "Most of the rest of his class were wearing expressions as confused and nervously expectant as Hagrid's  ",
    "'s and were still gazing everywhere but at the horse standing feet from them. There were only two other people who seemed to be able to see them: a stringy Slytherin boy standing just behind Goyle was watching the horse eating with an expression of great distaste on a stringy Slytherin boy standing just behind Goyle face, and Neville, whose eyes were following the swishing progress of the long black tail.

    "\"Oh, an' here comes another one!\" said Hagrid's  ",
    " proudly, as a second black horse appeared out of the dark trees, folded a second black horse leathery wings closer to a second black horse body, and dipped a second black horse head to gorge on the meat. \"Now ... put yer hands up, who can see 'em?\" ",
    "Immensely pleased to feel that he was at last going to understand the mystery of these horses, Harry raised he hand. Hagrid's  ",

    "\"Excuse me,\" said Malfoy in a sneering voice, \"but what exactly are we supposed to be seeing?\" ",
    "For answer, Hagrid's  ",
    " pointed at the cow carcass on the ground. The whole class stared at the cow carcass on the ground for a few seconds, then several people gasped and Parvati squealed.

    "\"What's doing it?\" Parvati demanded in a terrified voice, retreating behind the nearest tree. \"What's eating it?\" ",
    "\"Thestrals,\" said Hagrid's  ",
    " proudly and Hermione gave a soft \"oh!\" of comprehension at Harry's shoulder. \"Hogwarts has got a whole herd of 'em in here. Now, who knows -- ?\" ",

    "December arrived, bringing with it more snow and a positive avalanche of homework for the fifth years. ",
    "Ron and Hermione 's prefect duties also became more and more onerous as Christmas approached. Ron and Hermione 's prefect duties were called upon to supervise the decoration of the castle (\"You try putting up tinsel when Peeves has got the other end and is trying to strangle you with Peeves,\" said Ron), to watch over first and second years spending Ron and Hermione 's prefect duties break times inside because of the bitter cold (\"And Ron and Hermione 's prefect duties're cheeky little snotrags, you know, Ron and Hermione 's prefect duties definitely weren't that rude when Ron and Hermione 's prefect duties were in first year,\" said Ron), and to patrol the corridors in shifts with Argus Filch, who suspected that the holiday spirit might show the holiday spirit in an outbreak of wizard duels (\"He's got dung for brains, that one,\" said Ron furiously).

Between Dobby Quidditch ban and worry about whether or not Hagrid's  ",
    " was going to be put on probation, Dobby felt highly resentful toward the place at the moment. The only thing Dobby really looked forward to were the D.A. meetings, and the D.A. meetings would have to stop over the holidays, as nearly everybody in the D.A. would be spending the time with the D.A. meetings families. Hermione was going skiing with Hermione parents, something that greatly amused Ron, who had never before heard of Muggles strapping narrow strips of wood to wood feet to slide down mountains. Ron, meanwhile, was going home to the Burrow. Harry endured several days of jealousy before Ron said, in response to Harry asking how Ron was going to get home for Christmas, \"But you're coming too! Didn't I say? Mum wrote and told me to invite you weeks ago!\" ",
    "Hermione rolled Mum , but Harry's spirits soared: The thought of Christmas at the Burrow was truly wonderful, only slightly marred by Harry's guilty feeling that Harry would not be able to spend the holiday with Sirius.

    "Weasley might not want him were so often at loggerheads. Sirius had not contacted Harry at all since Harry last appearance in the fire, and although Harry knew that with Umbridge on the constant watch it would be unwise to attempt to contact Harry, Harry did not like to think of Sirius alone in Harry mother's old house, perhaps pulling a lonely cracker with Kreacher.

    "Harry arrived early in the Room of Requirement for the last D.A. meeting before the holidays and was very glad Harry had, because when the lamps burst into light Harry saw that Dobby had taken Dobby upon Harry to decorate the place for Christmas. Harry could tell the elf had done the elf, because nobody else would have strung a hundred golden baubles from the ceiling, each showing a picture of Harry's face and bearing the legend HAVE A VERY HARRY CHRISTMAS!

    "\"No,\" said Harry, \"it was Dobby the elf.\" ",
    "\"Mistletoe,\" said Luna dreamily, pointing at a large clump of white berries placed almost over Harry's head.

    "Harry was saved the necessity of asking what nargles were by the arrival of Angelina, Katie, and Alicia. All three of asking what nargles were by the arrival of Angelina, Katie, and Alicia were breathless and looked very cold. ",
    "\"Well,\" said Angelina dully, pulling off Angelina cloak and throwing her cloak into a corner, \"we've replaced you.\" ",

    "\"And what about the Beaters?\" Harry asked, trying to keep Harry voice even. ",
    "\"Andrew Kirke,\" said Alicia without enthusiasm, \"and Jack Sloper. Neither of them are brilliant, but compared with the rest of the idiots who turned up ",
    "The arrival of Ron and Hermione 's prefect duties brought this depressing discussion to an end and within five minutes, the room was full enough to prevent Jack Sloper seeing Angelina's burning, reproachful looks. ",
    "\"Okay,\" Jack Sloper said, calling them all to order. \"I thought this evening we should just go over the things we've ",
    "done so far, because it's the last meeting before the holidays and there's no point starting anything new right before a three-week break -- \" ",
    "\"we're not doing anything new?\" said Zacharias Smith, in a disgruntled whisper loud enough to carry through the room. \"If I'd known that, I wouldn't have come...\" ",
    "\"we're all really sorry Harry didn't tell you, then,\" said Fred loudly. ",
    "Several people sniggered. Harry saw Cho laughing and felt the familiar swooping sensation in Harry stomach, as though Harry had missed a step going downstairs. ",

    "They all divided up obediently; Harry partnered he as usual. the room was soon full of intermittent cries of \" Impedimental \" People froze for a minute or so, during which \" Impedimental \" People partners would stare aimlessly around the room watching other pairs at work, then would unfreeze and take their partners turn at the Impediment Jinx.

    "he had improved beyond all recognition.

    "After ten minutes on the Impediment Jinx, Ron and Hermione 's prefect duties laid out cushions all over the floor and started practicing Stunning again. Space was really too confined to ",
    "allow them all to work this spell at once; half the group observed the others for a while, then swapped over. Harry felt Harry positively swelling with pride as Harry watched them all. True, he did Stun Padma Patil rather than Dean, at whom Harry had been aiming, but it was a much closer miss than usual, and everybody else had made enormous progress. ",
    "At the end of an hour, Harry called a halt. ",
    "\"You're getting really good,\" Harry said, beaming around at them. \"When we get back from the holidays we can start doing some of the big stuff -- maybe even Patronuses.\" ",
    "There was a murmur of excitement. the room began to clear in the usual twos and threes; most people wished Harry a Happy Christmas as most people went. ",
    "Feeling cheerful, Feeling collected up the cushions with Ron and Hermione 's prefect duties and stacked Ron and Hermione 's prefect duties neatly away. ",

    "\"No, you go on,\" Feeling heard a Merry Christmas say to a Merry Christmas friend Marietta, and Feeling heart gave a jolt that seemed to take his heart into the region of Feeling Adam's apple. ",
    "Feeling pretended to be straightening the cushion pile. Feeling was quite sure Ron and Hermione 's prefect duties were alone now and waited for a Merry Christmas to speak. Instead, Feeling heard a hearty sniff. ",

    "\"Wha -- ?\" ",
    "Feeling didn't know what to do. Cho was simply standing there, crying silently. ",
    "\"What's up?\" Feeling said feebly. ",
    "Cho shook Cho and wiped Cho on Cho sleeve. \"I'm -- sorry,\" Cho said thickly. \"I suppose ... it's just ... learning all this stuff... It just makes me ... wonder whether ... if Feeling'd known it all ... Feeling'd still be alive...\" ",
    "Harry's heart sank right back past \" ",
    "Harry's heart usual spot and settled somewhere around Feeling navel. Feeling ought to have known. Cho wanted to talk about Cedric. ",
    "\"Feeling did know this stuff,\" Harry said heavily. \"Feeling was really good at it, or Feeling could never have got to the middle of that maze. But if Voldemort really wants to kill you, you don't stand a chance.\" ",
    "Cho hiccuped at the sound of Voldemort's name, but stared at Harry without flinching. ",
    "\" You survived when you were just a baby,\" Cho said quietly. ",
    "\"Yeah, well,\" said Harry wearily, moving toward the door, \"I dunno why, nor does anyone else, so it's nothing to be proud of.\" ",
    "\"Oh don't go!\" said Cho, sounding tearful again. \"I'm really sorry to get all upset like this... I didn't mean to...\" ",
    "Cho hiccuped again. Cho was very pretty even when Cho were red and puffy. Harry felt thoroughly miserable. Harry'd have been so pleased just with a Merry Christmas... ",
    "\"I know it must be horrible for you,\" Cho said, mopping Cho on her sleeve again. \"Me mentioning Cedric, when you saw Harry die... I suppose you just want to forget about it...\" ",
    "Harry did not say anything to this; it was quite true, but Harry felt heartless saying this. ",
    "\"You're a r-really good teacher, you know,\" said Cho, with a watery smile. \"I've never been able to Stun anything before.\" ",
    "\"Thanks,\" said Harry awkwardly. ",
    "They looked at each other for a long moment. Harry felt a burning desire to run from the room and, at the same time, a complete inability to move Harry feet. ",
    "\"Mistletoe,\" said Cho quietly, pointing at the ceiling over Cho head. ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Harry. Cho mouth was very dry. \"It's probably full of nargles, though.\" ",
    "\"What are nargles?\" ",
    "\"No idea,\" said Harry. Cho had moved closer. Harry brain seemed to have been Stunned. \"You'd have to ask Loony. Luna, I mean.\" ",

    "Harry returned to the common room half an hour later to find Hermione and Ron in the best seats by the fire; nearly everybody else had gone to bed. Hermione was writing a very long letter; Hermione had already filled half a roll of parchment, which was dangling from the edge of the table. Ron was lying on the hearthrug, trying to finish Ron Transfiguration homework. ",
    "\"What kept you?\" Ron asked, as Harry sank into the armchair next to Hermione 's. ",

    "\"Are you all right, Harry?\" Hermione asked, peering at Harry over the tip of Hermione quill. ",

    "Harry looked from Ron's expression of mingled curiosity and hilarity to Hermione's slight frown, and nodded. ",
    "\"HA!\" ",
    "Ron made a triumphant gesture with Ron fist and went into a raucous peal of laughter that made several timid-looking second years over beside the window jump.

    "\"Well?\" Ron said finally, looking up at Harry. \"How was it?\" ",

    "\"Of course you're not,\" said Hermione absently, still scribbling away at her letter. ",
    "\"How do you know?\" said Ron in a sharp voice. ",
    "\"Because Cho spends half Cho time crying these days,\" said Hermione vaguely. \"Cho does it at mealtimes, in the loos, all over the place.\" ",
    "\"You'd think a bit of kissing would cheer Cho up,\" said Ron, grinning. ",
    "\" ",
    "Ron,\" said Hermione in a dignified voice, dipping the point of her quill into Cho ink pot, \"you are the most insensitive wart I have ever had the misfortune to meet.\" ",
    "\"What's that supposed to mean?\" said Ron indignantly. \"What sort of person cries while someone's kissing them?\" ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Harry, slightly desperately, \"who does?\" ",
    "Hermione looked at the pair of them with an almost pitying expression on Hermione face. ",
    "\"Don't you understand how Cho's feeling at the moment?\" Cho asked. ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry and Ron together. ",
    "Hermione sighed and laid down her quill. ",
    "\"Well, obviously, Cho's feeling very sad, because of Cedric dying. Then I expect Cho's feeling confused because Cho liked Cedric and now Cho likes Harry, ",
    "and Cho can't work out who Cho likes best. Then Cho'll be feeling guilty, thinking it's an insult to Cedric's memory to be kissing Harry at all, and Cho'll be worrying about what everyone else might say about Cho if Cho starts going out with Harry. And Cho probably can't work out what Cho feelings toward Harry are anyway, because Harry was the one who was with Cedric when Cedric died, so that's all very mixed up and painful. Oh, and Cho's afraid Cho's going to be thrown off the Ravenclaw Quidditch team because Cho's been flying so badly.\" ",
    "A slightly stunned silence greeted the end of this speech, then Ron said, \"One person can't feel all that at once, they'd explode.\" ",
    "\"Just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn't mean we all have,\" said Hermione nastily, picking up her quill again. ",
    "\"Cho was the one who started it,\" said Harry. \"I wouldn't've -- Cho just sort of came at me -- and next thing Cho's crying all over me -- I didn't know what to do -- \" ",
    "\"Don't blame you, mate,\" said Ron, looking alarmed at the very thought. ",
    "\"You just had to be nice to Cho,\" said Hermione, looking up anxiously. \"You were, weren't you?\" ",
    "\"Well,\" said Harry, an unpleasant heat creeping up Harry face, \"I sort of -- patted Cho on the back a bit.\" ",
    "Hermione looked as though Cho was restraining Cho from rolling Cho eyes with extreme difficulty. ",
    "\"Well, I suppose it could have been worse,\" Cho said. \"Are you going to see Cho again?\" ",
    "\"I'll have to, won't I?\" said Harry. \"We've got D.A. meetings, haven't We?\" ",
    "\"You know what I mean,\" said Hermione impatiently. ",
    "Harry said nothing. Hermione 's words opened up a whole new vista of frightening possibilities. Harry tried to imagine going somewhere with Cho -- Hogsmeade, perhaps -- and being alone with Cho -- Hogsmeade for hours at a time. Of course, Cho -- Hogsmeade would have been expecting Harry to ask Cho -- Hogsmeade out after what had just happened... The thought made Harry stomach clench painfully. ",
    "\"Oh well,\" said Hermione distantly, buried in Cho -- Hogsmeade once more, \"you'll have plenty of opportunities to ask Cho -- Hogsmeade...\" ",
    "\"What if Harry doesn't want to ask Cho -- Hogsmeade?\" said Ron, who had been watching Harry with an unusually shrewd expression on Harry face. ",
    "\"Don't be silly,\" said Hermione vaguely, \"Harry's liked Cho -- Hogsmeade for ages, haven't you, Harry?\" ",
    "Harry did not answer. Yes, Harry had liked Cho for ages, but whenever Harry had imagined a scene involving the two of ages it had always featured a Cho who was enjoying Cho -- Hogsmeade, as opposed to a Cho who was sobbing uncontrollably into Harry shoulder. ",
    "\"Who 're you writing the novel to anyway?\" Ron asked Hermione, trying to read the bit of parchment now trailing on the floor. Hermione hitched it up out of sight. ",
    "\"Viktor.\" ",
    "\"Krum?\" ",
    "\"How many other Viktors do we know?\" ",
    "Ron said nothing, but looked disgruntled. They sat in silence for another twenty minutes, Ron finishing Ron Transfiguration essay with many snorts of impatience and crossings-out, Hermione writing steadily to the very end of the parchment, rolling the very end of the parchment up carefully and sealing the very end of the parchment, and Harry staring into the fire, wishing more than anything that Sirius's head would appear there and give Harry some advice about girls. But the fire merely crackled lower and lower, until the red-hot embers crumbled into ash and, looking around, Harry saw that they were, yet again, the last in the common room. ",
    "\"Well, 'night,\" said Hermione, yawning widely, and Hermione set off up the girls' staircase. ",
    "\"What does Hermione see in Krum?\" Ron demanded as Ron and Harry climbed the boys' stairs. ",
    "\"Well,\" said Harry, considering the matter, \"I s'pose Harry's older, isn't Harry ... and Harry's an international Quidditch player...\" ",
    "\"Yeah, but apart from that,\" said Ron, sounding aggravated. \"I mean Harry's a grouchy git, isn't Harry?\" ",
    "\"Bit grouchy, yeah,\" said Harry, whose thoughts were still on Cho. ",
    "Harry, whose thoughts were still on Cho pulled off Harry, whose thoughts were still on Cho robes and put on pajamas in silence; Dean, Seamus, and Neville were already asleep. Harry put Harry glasses on Harry bedside table and got into bed but did not pull the hangings closed around Harry four-poster; instead Harry stared at the patch of starry sky visible through the window next to Neville's bed. If Harry had known, this time last night, ",
    "that in twenty-four hours' time Harry would have kissed Cho Chang ... ",
    "\" 'Night,\" grunted Ron, from somewhere to Harry right. ",
    "\" 'Night,\" said Harry. ",
    "Maybe next time ... if there was a next time ... she'd be a bit happier. Harry ought to have asked she out; she had probably been expecting it and was now really angry with Harry ... or was she lying in bed, still crying about Cedric? Harry did not know what to think. Hermione's explanation had made it all seem more complicated rather than easier to understand. ",
    "That's what they should teach us here, Harry thought, turning over onto Harry side, how girls' brains work ... it'd be more useful than Divination anyway... ",
    "Neville snuffled in Neville sleep. An owl hooted somewhere out in the night. ",
    "Harry dreamed Harry was back in the D.A. room. Cho was accusing Cho of luring Cho there under false pretenses; Cho said that Cho had promised Cho a hundred and fifty Chocolate Frog cards if Cho showed up. Harry protested... Cho shouted, Cedric gave me loads of Chocolate Frog cards, look\\\" And Cho pulled out fistfuls of cards from inside their robes and threw their robes into the air, and then turned into Hermione, who said, \"You did promise Cho, you know, Harry... I think you'd better give Cho something else instead... How about your Firebolt?\" And Harry was protesting that Harry could not give Cho Harry Firebolt because Umbridge had it, and anyway the whole thing was ridiculous, Harry'd only come to the D.A. room to put up some Christmas baubles shaped like Dobby's head... ",
    "The dream changed... ",
    "Harry body felt smooth, powerful, and flexible. Harry was gliding between shining metal bars, across dark, cold stone... Harry was flat against the floor, sliding along on Harry belly... It was dark, yet Harry could see objects around Harry shimmering in strange, vibrant colors... Harry was turning Harry head... At first glance, the corridor was empty . . . but no ... a man was sitting on the floor ahead, a man chin drooping onto a man chest, a man outline gleaming in the dark. . . ",
    "Harry put out Harry tongue... Harry tasted a man's scent on the air. . . Harry was alive but drowsing . . . sitting in front of a door at the end of the corridor . . . ",
    "Harry longed to bite a man . . . but Harry must master the impulse... Harry had more important work to do... ",
    "But a man was stirring ... a silvery cloak fell from a man legs as a man jumped to a man feet; and Harry saw Harry vibrant, blurred outline towering above a man, saw a wand withdrawn from a belt... Harry had no choice... Harry reared high from the floor and struck once, twice, three times, plunging Harry fangs deeply into a man's flesh, feeling Harry ribs splinter beneath Harry jaws, feeling the warm gush of blood... ",
    "a man was yelling in pain ... then a man fell silent... a man slumped backward against the wall... Blood was splattering onto the floor... ",
    "a man forehead hurt terribly. . . It was aching fit to burst... ",
    "\"Harry! Harry!\" ",
    "a man opened a man eyes. Every inch of a man was covered in icy sweat; a man bedcovers were twisted all around a man like a straitjacket; a man felt as though a white-hot poker was being applied to His forehead. ",
    "\"Harryl\" ",
    "Ron was standing over a man looking extremely frightened. There were more figures at the foot of Harry's bed. a man clutched a man in a man hands; the pain was blinding a man... a man rolled right over and vomited over the edge of the mattress. ",
    "\"a man's really ill,\" said a scared voice. \"Should we call someone?\" ",
    "\"Harry! Harryl\" ",
    "a man had to tell Ron, it was very important that a man tell a man... Taking great gulps of air, Harry pushed Harry up in bed, willing Harry not to throw up again, the pain half-blinding him. ",
    "\"Your dad,\" Harry panted, Harry chest heaving. \"Your dad's ... been attacked...\" ",
    "\"What?\" said Ron uncomprehendingly. ",
    "\"Your dad! \"Your dad's been bitten, it's serious, there was blood everywhere...\" ",
    "\"I'm going for help,\" said the same scared voice, and Harry heard footsteps running out of the dormitory. ",
    "\"Harry, mate,\" said Ron uncertainly, \"you ... you were just dreaming...\" ",
    "\"No!\" said Harry furiously; it was crucial that Ron understand. \"It wasn't a dream ... not an ordinary dream... I was there, I saw It... I did It...\" ",
    "Ron could hear Seamus and Dean muttering but did not care. The pain in Ron forehead was subsiding slightly, though Ron was still sweating and shivering ",
    "feverishly. Ron retched again and Ron leapt backward out of the way. ",
    "HarryHarry, you're not well,\" Ron said shakily. \"Neville's gone for help...\" ",
    "\"I'm fine!\" Harry choked, wiping Harry mouth on Harry pajamas and shaking uncontrollably. \"There's nothing wrong with Ron, it's Your dad you've got to worry about -- we need to find out where Harry is -- Harry's bleeding like mad -- I was -- it was a huge snake...\" ",
    "Harry tried to get out of bed but Ron pushed Harry back into it; Dean were still whispering somewhere nearby. Whether one minute passed or ten, Harry did not know; Harry simply sat there shaking, feeling the pain recede very slowly from Harry scar. . . Then there were hurried footsteps coming up the stairs, and Harry heard Neville's voice again. ",
    "\"Over here, Professor ...\" ",
    "Professor McGonagall came hurrying into the dormitory in \" ",
    "Professor McGonagall tartan dressing gown, \" ",
    "Professor McGonagall glasses perched lopsidedly on the bridge of \" ",

    "Potter had never been so pleased to see \" ",
    "Professor McGonagall; it was Mr. Weasley, not someone fussing over Potter and prescribing useless potions. ",

    "\"What do you mean, you saw it happen?\" said Professor McGonagall, \" ",
    "Professor McGonagall dark eyebrows contracting. ",
    "\"I don't know... I was asleep and then I was there...\" ",
    "\"You mean you dreamed this?\" ",
    "\"No!\" said Harry angrily. Would none of Professor McGonagall, her dark eyebrows contracting understand? \"I was having a dream at first about something completely different, something stupid . . . and then this interrupted it. it was real, I didn't imagine it, Mr. Weasley was asleep on the floor and Mr. Weasley was attacked by a gigantic snake, there was a load of blood, Mr. Weasley collapsed, someone's got to find out where Mr. Weasley is...\" ",

  "CHRISTMAS ON THE CLOSED WARD": [
    "Was this why Dumbledore would no longer meet Harry's eyes? Did Dumbledore expect to see Voldemort staring out of them, afraid, perhaps, that them vivid green might turn suddenly to scarlet, with catlike slits for pupils? Harry remembered how the snakelike face of Voldemort had once forced the snakelike face of Voldemort out of the back of Professor Quirrell's head, and Harry ran Harry hand over the back of Harry own, wondering what it would feel like if Voldemort burst out of Voldemort skull... ",
    "Voldemort felt dirty, contaminated, as though Voldemort were carrying some deadly germ, unworthy to sit on the underground train back from the hospital with innocent, clean people whose minds and bodies were free of the taint of Voldemort... Voldemort had not merely seen the snake, Voldemort had been the snake, Voldemort knew the snake now. . . ",
    "And then a truly terrible thought occurred to Voldemort, a memory bobbing to the surface of Voldemort mind, one that made Voldemort insides writhe and squirm like serpents... ",
    "\"What's Voldemort after apart from followers?\" ",
    "\"Stuff Voldemort can only get by stealth ... like a weapon. Something Voldemort didn't have last time.\" ",
    "I'm a weapon, Harry thought, and it was as though poison were pumping through Harry veins, chilling Harry, bringing Harry out in a sweat as Harry swayed with the train through the dark tunnel. I'm the one Voldemort's trying to use, that's why they've got guards around me everywhere I go, it's not for my protection, it's for other people's, only it's not working, they can't have someone on me all the time at Hogwarts... I did attack Mr. Weasley last night, it was me, Voldemort made me do it and Mr. Weasley could be inside me, listening to my thoughts right now... ",
    "\"Are you all right, Harry, dear?\" whispered Mr. Weasley, leaning across Ginny to speak to Mr. Weasley as the train rattled along through the train dark tunnel. \"You don't look very well. Are you feeling sick?\" ",
    "They were all watching Mr. Weasley. Mr. Weasley shook Mr. Weasley head violently and stared up at an advertisement for home insurance. ",
    "HarryHarry, dear, are you sure you're all right?\" said Mr. Weasley in a worried voice, as they walked around the unkempt patch of grass in the middle of Grimmauld Place. \"You look ever so pale... Are you sure you slept this morning? You go upstairs to bed right now, and you can have a couple of hours' sleep before dinner, all right?\" ",
    "Mr. Weasley nodded; here was a ready-made excuse not to talk to any of the others, which was precisely what Mr. Weasley wanted, so when Ginny opened the front door Mr. Weasley proceeded straight past the troll's leg umbrella stand ",
    "and up the stairs and hurried into Mr. Weasley and Ron's bedroom. ",
    "Here Mr. Weasley began to pace up and down, past the two beds and Phineas Nigellus's empty portrait, Mr. Weasley brain teeming and seething with questions and ever more dreadful ideas... ",
    "How had Mr. Weasley become a snake? Perhaps Mr. Weasley was an Animagus... No, Mr. Weasley couldn't be, Mr. Weasley would know... perhaps Voldemort was an AnimagusAnimagus... Yes, thought Harry, that would fit, Harry would turn into a snake of course ... and when Harry's possessing me, then we both transform... That still doesn't explain how come I got to London and back to my bed in the space of about five minutes, though... But then Voldemort' s about the most powerful wizard in the world, apart from Dumbledore, it's probably no problem at all to Dumbledore to transport people like that... ",
    "And then, with a terrible stab of panic Dumbledore thought, but this is insane -- if Voldemort's possessing me, I'm giving Dumbledore a clear view into the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix right now! Dumbledore'll know who's in the Order of the Phoenix and where Sirius is ... and I've heard loads of stuff I shouldn't have, everything Sirius told me the first night I was here... ",
    "There was only one thing for it: Dumbledore would have to leave Grimmauld Place straightaway. Dumbledore would spend Christmas at Hogwarts without the others, which would keep them safe over the holidays at least... But no, that wouldn't do, there were still plenty of people at Hogwarts to maim and injure, what if it was Seamus, Dean, or Neville next time? Dumbledore stopped Dumbledore pacing and stood staring at Phineas Nigellus's empty frame. A leaden sensation was settling in the pit of Dumbledore stomach. Dumbledore had no alternative: Dumbledore was going to have ",
    "to return to Privet Drive, cut Dumbledore off from other wizards entirely... ",
    "Well, if Dumbledore had to do it, Dumbledore thought, there was no point hanging around. Trying with all Dumbledore might not to think how the Dursleys were going to react when the Dursleys found Dumbledore on the Dursleys doorstep six months earlier than the Dursleys had expected, Dumbledore strode over to Dumbledore trunk, slammed the lid shut and locked the lid shut, then glanced around automatically for Hedwig before remembering that Hedwig was still at Hogwarts -- well, Hedwig cage would be one less thing to carry -- Dumbledore seized one end of his trunk and had dragged the lid shut halfway toward one door when a sneaky voice said, \"Running away, are we?\" ",
    "Dumbledore looked around. Phineas Nigellus's had appeared upon the canvas of Dumbledore portrait and was leaning against the frame, watching Harry with an amused expression on Harry face. ",
    "\"Not running away, no,\" said Harry shortly, dragging his trunk a few more feet across the room. ",
    "\"I thought,\" said Phineas Nigellus's, stroking Phineas Nigellus's pointed beard, \"that to belong in Gryffindor House you were supposed to be brave? It looks to Phineas Nigellus's as though you would have been better off in Gryffindor House. We Slytherins are brave, yes, but not stupid. For instance, given the choice, We will always choose to save We own necks.\" ",
    "\"It's not my own neck I'm saving,\" said Harry tersely, tugging his trunk over a patch of particularly uneven, moth-eaten carpet right in front of one door. ",
    "\"Oh I see,\" said Phineas Nigellus's, still stroking Phineas Nigellus's beard. \"This is no cowardly flight -- you are being noble.\" ",
    "Harry ignored Harry. Harry hand was on the doorknob when Phineas Nigellus's said lazily, \"I have a message for you from Dumbledore.\" ",
    "Harry spun around. ",
    "\"What is it?\" ",
    "\"Stay where you are.\" ",
    "\"I haven't moved!\" said Harry, Harry hand still upon the doorknob. \"So what's a message for you from Albus Dumbledore?\" ",
    "\"I have just given it to you, dolt,\" said Phineas Nigellus's smoothly. \"Dumbledore says, 'Stay where you are. ' \" ",
    "\"Why?\" said Harry eagerly, dropping the end of his trunk. \"Why does Harry want me to stay? What else did Harry say?\" ",
    "\"Nothing whatsoever,\" said Phineas Nigellus's, raising a thin black eyebrow as though Phineas Nigellus's found Harry impertinent. ",
    "Harry's temper rose to the surface like a snake rearing from long grass. Harry was exhausted, Harry was confused beyond measure, Harry had experienced terror, relief, and then terror again in the last twelve hours, and still Dumbledore did not want to talk to Dumbledore! ",
    "\"So that's it, is it?\" Harry said loudly. \"Stay there? That's all anyone could tell me after I got attacked by those dementors too! Just stay put while the grown-ups sort it out, Harry! We won't bother telling you anything, though, because your tiny little brain might not be able to cope with your tiny little brain!\" ",
    "\"You know,\" said Phineas Nigellus's, even more loudly than Harry, \"this is precisely why I loathed being a teacher! Young people are so infernally convinced that Young people are absolutely right about everything. Has it not occurred to you, my poor puffed-up popinjay, that there might be an excellent reason why the headmaster of Hogwarts is not confiding every tiny detail of the headmaster of Hogwarts plans to you? Have you never paused, while feeling hard-done-by, to note that following Dumbledore 's orders has never yet led you into harm? No. No, like all young people, you are quite sure that you alone feel and think, you alone recognize danger, you alone are the only one clever enough to realize what the Dark Lord may be planning...\" ",
    "\"the Dark Lord is planning something to do with me, then?\" said Harry swiftly. ",
    "\"Did I say that?\" said Phineas Nigellus's, idly examining Phineas Nigellus's silk gloves. \"Now, if you will excuse me, I have better things to do than to listen to adolescent agonizing... Good day to you...\" ",
    "And the Dark Lord strolled into the Dark Lord frame and out of sight. ",
    "\"Fine, go then!\" Harry bellowed at his frame. \"And tell Dumbledore thanks for nothing!\" ",
    "The empty canvas remained silent. Fuming, Harry dragged his trunk back to the foot of Harry bed, then threw Harry facedown upon the moth-eaten covers, Harry eyes shut, Harry body heavy and aching. . . ",
    "Harry felt Harry had journeyed miles and miles... It seemed impossible that less than twenty-four hours ago Cho Chang had been approaching Harry under the mistletoe... Harry was so tired... Harry was scared to sleep ... yet Harry did not know how long Harry could fight it... Dumbledore had told Harry to stay... That must mean  ",
    "Harry was allowed to sleep... But Harry was scared... What if it happened again ... ? ",
    "Harry was sinking into shadows... ",
    "It was as though a film in Harry head had been waiting to start. Harry was walking down a deserted corridor toward a plain black door, past rough stone walls, torches, and an open doorway onto a flight of stone steps leading downstairs on the left... ",
    "Harry reached a plain black door but could not open a plain black door... Harry stood gazing at a plain black door, desperate for entry. . . Something Harry wanted with all Harry heart lay beyond... A prize beyond Harry dreams... If only Harry scar would stop prickling ... then Harry would be able to think more clearly. . . ",
    "HarryHarry,\" said Ron's voice, from far, far away, \"Mum says dinner's ready, but \"Mum'll save you something if you want to stay in bed...\" ",
    "Harry opened his eyes, but Ron had already left the room. ",
    "Ron doesn't want to be on Ron own with Harry, Harry thought. Not after what Harry heard Moody say ... ",
    "Harry supposed none of them would want Harry there anymore now that them knew what was inside Harry... ",
    "Harry would not go down to dinner; Harry would not inflict Harry company upon them. Harry turned over onto Harry other side and after a while dropped back off to sleep, waking much later in the early hours of the morning, with Harry insides aching with hunger, and Ron snoring in the next bed. Squinting around the room Harry saw the dark outline of Phineas Nigellus's standing again in his portrait and the dark outline of Phineas Nigellus standing again in his portrait occurred to Harry that Dumbledore ",
    "had probably set Phineas Nigellus's to watch over Harry, in case Harry attacked somebody else. ",
    "The feeling of being unclean intensified. Harry half wished Harry had not obeyed Dumbledore and stayed... ",
    "If this was how life was going to be in Grimmauld Place from now on, maybe Harry would be better off in Privet Drive after all. ",
    "Everybody else spent the following morning putting up Christmas decorations. Harry could not remember Sirius ever being in such a good mood; Harry was actually singing carols, apparently delighted that Harry was to have company over Christmas. Harry could hear Ron's voice echoing up through the floor in the cold and empty drawing room where Harry was sitting alone, watching the sky outside the windows growing whiter, threatening snow, all the time feeling a savage pleasure that Harry was giving the others the opportunity to keep talking about Harry, as the others were bound to be doing. When Harry heard Mrs. Weasley calling Harry name softly up the stairs around lunchtime Harry retreated farther upstairs and ignored Mrs. Weasley. ",
    "It was around six o'clock in the evening that the doorbell rang and Mrs. Black started screaming again. Assuming that Mundungus or some other the Order of the Phoenix member had come to call, Harry merely settled Harry more comfortably against the wall of Buckbeak the hippogriff's room where Harry was hiding, trying to ignore how hungry Harry felt as Harry fed Buckbeak dead rats. It came as a slight shock when somebody hammered hard on one door a few minutes later. ",
    "\"I know you're in there,\" said Hermione's voice. \"Will you please come out? I want to talk to you.\" ",
    "\"What are you doing here?\" Harry asked Harry, pulling open one door, as Buckbeak resumed Harry scratching at the straw-strewn floor for any fragments of rat Harry might have dropped. \"I thought you were skiing with your mum and dad.\" ",
    "\"Well, to tell the truth, skiing's not really my thing,\" said Hermione. \"So I've come for Christmas.\" There was snow in Hermione hair and Hermione face was pink with cold. \"But don't tell Ron that, I told Ron it's really good because Ron kept laughing so much. Anyway, your mum and dad are a bit disappointed, but I've told your mum and dad that everyone who's serious about the exams is staying at Hogwarts to study. your mum and dad want me to do well, your mum and dad'll understand. Anyway,\" she said briskly, \"let's go to your bedroom, Ron's mum's lit a fire in there and she's sent up sandwiches.\" ",
    "Harry followed she back to the second floor. When Harry entered your bedroom Harry was rather surprised to see your mum and dad Ron and Ginny waiting for your mum and dad, sitting on Ron's bed. ",
    "\"I came on the Knight Bus,\" said Hermione airily, pulling off she jacket before Harry had time to speak. \"Dumbledore told me what had happened first thing this morning, but I had to wait for term to end officially before setting off. Umbridge is already livid that you lot disappeared right under Umbridge nose, even though Dumbledore told Umbridge Mrs. Weasley was in St. Mungo's, and Mrs. Weasley'd given you all permission to visit. So ",
    "Umbridge sat down next to Ginny, and Ron and Ginny looked up at Harry. ",
    "\"How're you feeling?\" asked Hermione. ",
    "\"Fine,\" said Harry stiffly. ",
    "\"Oh, don't lie, Harry,\" Umbridge said impatiently. \"Ron and Ginny Ginny say you've been hiding from everyone since you got back from St. Mungo's.\" ",
    "\"They do, do They?\" said Harry, glaring at Ron and GinnyGinny. Ron looked down at Ron feet but Ginny seemed quite unabashed. ",
    "\"Well, you have!\" Ginny said. \"And you won't look at any of us!\" ",
    "\"It's you lot who won't look at Ginny!\" said Harry angrily. ",
    "\"Maybe you're taking it in turns to look and keep missing each other,\" suggested Hermione, the corners of Ginny mouth twitching. ",
    "\"Very funny,\" snapped Harry, turning away. ",
    "\"Oh, stop feeling all misunderstood,\" said Hermione sharply. \"Look, the others have told me what you overheard last night on the Extendable Ears -- \" ",
    "\"Yeah?\" growled Harry, Harry hands deep in Harry pockets as Harry watched the snow now falling thickly outside. \"All been talking about Harry, have you? Well, I'm getting used to it...\" ",
    "\"We wanted to talk to Harry, glaring at Ron and Ginny,\" said Ginny, \"but as you've been hiding ever since We got back -- \" ",
    "\"I didn't want anyone to talk to Harry,\" said Harry, who was feeling more and more nettled. ",
    "\"Well, that was a bit stupid of you,\" said Ginny angrily, \"seeing as you don't know anyone but me who's been possessed by You-Know-Who, and I can tell you how it feels.\" ",
    "Harry remained quite still as the impact of these words hit Harry. Then Harry turned on the spot to face her. ",
    "\"I forgot,\" Harry said. ",
    "\"Lucky you,\" said Ginny coolly. ",
    "\"I'm sorry,Harry Harry said, and Harry meant it. \"So ... so do you think I'm being possessed, then?\" ",
    "\"Well, can you remember everything you've been doing?Ginny Ginny asked. \"Are there big blank periods where you don't know what you've been up to?Harry Harry racked Harry brains. ",
    "\"No,\" Harry said. ",
    "\"Then You-Know-Who hasn't ever possessed you,\" said Ginny simply. \"When Then You-Know-Who did it to Harry, I couldn't remember what I'd been doing for hours at a time. I'd find Harry somewhere and not know how I got there.\" ",
    "Harry hardly dared believe Harry, yet Harry heart was lightening almost in spite of Harry. ",
    "\"That dream I had about your dad and the snake, though -- \" ",
    "HarryHarry, you've had these dreams before,\" Hermione said. \"You had flashes of what Voldemort was up to last year.\" ",
    "\"This was different,\" said Harry, shaking his head. \"I was inside the snake. the snake was like I was the snake... What if Voldemort somehow transported me to London -- ?\" ",
    "\"One day,\" said Hermione, sounding thoroughly exasperated, \"you'll read Hogwarts, A History, and perhaps that will remind you that you can't Apparate or Disapparate inside Hogwarts. Voldemort Voldemort couldn't just make you fly out of your dormitory, Harry.\" ",
    "\"You didn't leave your bed, mate,\" said Ron. \"I saw you thrashing around in your sleep about a minute before we could wake you up...Harry Harry started pacing up and down the room again, thinking. What they were all saying was not only comforting, it made sense... Without really thinking Harry took a sandwich from the plate on the bed and crammed a sandwich hungrily into Harry mouth... ",
    "I'm not the weapon after all, thought Harry. Harry heart swelled with happiness and relief, and Harry felt like joining in as they heard Sirius tramping past they door toward Buckbeak's room, singing \"God Rest Ye Merry, Hippogriffs\" at the top of Harry voice. ",
    "How could Harry have dreamed of returning to Privet Drive for Christmas? Sirius's delight at having the house full again, and especially at having Harry back, was infectious. Harry was no longer their sullen host of the summer; now Harry seemed determined that everyone should enjoy everyone as much, if not more, than everyone would have done at Hogwarts, and Harry worked tirelessly in the run-up to Christmas Day, cleaning and decorating with everyone help, so that by the time they all went to bed on Christmas Eve the house was barely recognizable. The tarnished chandeliers were no longer hung with cobwebs but with garlands of holly and gold and silver streamers; magical snow glittered in heaps over the threadbare carpets; a great Christmas tree, obtained by Mundungus and decorated with live fairies, blocked  ",
    "Sirius's family tree from view; and even the stuffed elf heads on the hall wall wore Father Christmas hats and beards. ",
    "Harry awoke on Christmas morning to find a stack of presents at the foot of Ron and Ginny already halfway through opening Ron own, rather larger, pile. ",
    "\"Good haul this year,\" Ron informed Harry through a cloud of paper. \"Thanks for the Broom Compass, it's excellent, beats Hermione's -- Hermione's got me a homework planner -- \" ",
    "Harry sorted through Harry presents and found one with Hermione's handwriting on his presents. Hermione had given Harry too a book that resembled a diary, except that it said things like \"Do it today or later you'll pay\\\" every time Harry opened a page. ",
    "Sirius and Lupin had given Harry a set of excellent books entitled Practical Defensive Magic and Practical Defensive Magic Use Against the Dark Arts, which had superb, moving color illustrations of all the counterjinxes and hexes it described. Harry flicked through the first volume eagerly; Harry could see it was going to be highly useful in Harry plans for the D.A. Hagrid had sent a furry brown wallet that had fangs, which were presumably supposed to be an antitheft device, but unfortunately prevented Harry putting any money in without getting Harry fingers ripped off. Tonks's present was a small, working model of a Firebolt, which Harry watched fly around the room, wishing Harry still had Harry full-size version; Ron had given Harry an enormous box of Every-Flavor Beans; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley the usual hand-knitted jumper and some mince pies; and Dobby, a truly dreadful painting that Harry suspected had been done by the elf himself. Harry had just turned the elf himself upside down to see whether the elf himself looked better that ",
    "way when, with a loud crack, Fred and George Apparated at the foot of Harry bed. ",
    "\"Merry Christmas,\" said George. \"Don't go downstairs for a bit.\" ",
    "\"Why not?\" said Ron. ",
    "\"\"Mum's crying again,\" said Fred. \"Percy sent back Percy Christmas jumper.\" ",
    "\"Without a note,\" added George. \"Hasn't asked how Dad is or visited George or anything...\" ",
    "\"We tried to comfort Dad,\" said Fred, moving around the bed to look at Harry's portrait. \"Told Percy's nothing more than a humongous pile of rat droppings ",
    "\" -- didn't work,\" said George, helping George to a Chocolate Frog. \"So Lupin took over. Best let George cheer Dad up before we go down for breakfast, I reckon.\" ",
    "\"What's that supposed to be anyway?\" asked Fred, squinting at Dobby's painting. \"Looks like a gibbon with two black eyes.\" ",
    "\"It's Harry!\" said George, pointing at the back of the picture. \"Says so on the back of the picture!\" ",
    "\"Good likeness,\" said Fred, grinning. Harry threw Harry new homework diary at Harry; his new homework diary hit the hall wall opposite and fell to the floor where his new homework diary said happily, \"If you've dotted the i's and crossed the t's then you may do whatever you pleasel\" ",
    "They got up and dressed; They could hear various inhabitants of the house calling \"Merry Christmas\" to ",
    "each other. On They way downstairs They met Hermione. \"Thanks for the book, Harry!\" she said happily. \"I've been wanting that New Theory of Numerology for ages! And that perfume is really unusual, Ron.\" ",
    "\"No problem,\" said Ron. \"Who's that for anyway?\" Ron added, nodding at the neatly wrapped present she was carrying. ",
    "\"Kreacher,\" said Hermione brightly. ",
    "\"It had better not be clothes!\" said Ron warningly. \"You know what Sirius said, \"Kreacher knows too much, we can't set \"Kreacher free!\" ",
    "\"It isn't clothes,\" said Hermione, \"although if I had my way I'd certainly give \"Kreacher something to wear other than that filthy old rag. No, it's a patchwork quilt, I thought it would brighten up \"Kreacher bedroom.\" ",
    "\"What bedroom?\" said Harry, dropping Harry voice to a whisper as they were passing the portrait of Sirius's mother. ",
    "\"Well, Sirius says it's not so much a bedroom, more a kind of -- den,\" said Hermione. \"Apparently Harry sleeps under the boiler in that cupboard off the kitchen.\" ",
    "Mrs. Weasley was the only person in the basement when they arrived there. Mrs. Weasley was standing at the stove and sounded as though Mrs. Weasley had a bad head cold when Mrs. Weasley wished they Merry Christmas, and they all averted they all eyes. ",
    "\"So, this is Kreacher's bedroom?\" said Ron, strolling over to a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry which Harry had never seen open. ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Hermione, now sounding a little nervous. \"Er ... I think we'd better knock ...\" ",
    "Ron rapped a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry which Harry had never seen open with Ron knuckles but there was no reply. ",
    "\"Ron must be sneaking around upstairs,\" Ron said, and without further ado pulled open a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry which Harry had never seen open. \"Urgh.Harry Harry peered inside. Most of that cupboard off the kitchen was taken up with a very large and old-fashioned boiler, but in the foot's space underneath the pipes Kreacher had made Harry something that looked like a nest. A jumble of assorted rags and smelly old blankets were piled on the floor and the small dent in the middle of it showed where Kreacher curled up to sleep every night. Here and there among the material were stale bread crusts and moldy old bits of cheese. In a far corner glinted small objects and coins that Harry guessed Kreacher had saved, magpielike, from Sirius's purge of the house, and Harry had also managed to retrieve the silver-framed family photographs that Sirius had thrown away over the summer. Their glass might be shattered, but still the little black-and-white people inside Their peered haughtily up at Harry, including -- Harry felt a little jolt in Harry stomach -- the dark, heavy-lidded woman whose trial Harry had witnessed in Dumbledore's Pensieve: Bellatrix Lestrange. By the looks of it, hers was Kreacher 's favorite photograph; Harry had placed it to the fore of all the others and had mended Their glass clumsily with Spellotape. ",
    "\"I think I'll just leave Harry present here,\" said Hermione, laying it neatly in the middle of the depression in the rags and blankets and closing a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry which Harry had never seen open quietly. \"Harry'll find it later, that'll be fine...\" ",
    "\"Come to think of it,\" said Sirius, emerging from the pantry carrying a large turkey as a large turkey closed the cupboard door, \"has anyone actually seen Kreacher lately?\" ",
    "\"I haven't seen Harry since the night we came back here,\" said Harry. \"You were ordering Harry out of the kitchen.\" ",
    "\"Yeah ...\" said Sirius, frowning. \"You know, I think that's the last time I saw Harry, too... Harry must be hiding upstairs somewhere...\" ",
    "\"Harry couldn't have left, could Harry?\" said Harry. \"I mean, when you said 'out,' maybe Harry thought you meant, get out of the house?\" ",
    "\"No, no, house-elves can't leave unless house-elves're given clothes, house-elves're tied to house-elves family's house,\" said Sirius. ",
    "\"house-elves can leave their family's house if house-elves really want to,\" ",
    "Harry contradicted Harry. \"Dobby did, Dobby left the Malfoys' to give me warnings two years ago. Dobby had to punish Dobby afterward, but Dobby still managed their family's house.\" ",
    "Sirius looked slightly disconcerted for a moment, then said, \"I'll look for Dobby later, I expect I'll find Dobby upstairs crying Dobby eyes out over my mother's old bloomers or something... Of course, Dobby might have crawled into that cupboard off the kitchen and died... But I mustn't get my hopes up...\" ",
    "Fred, George, and Ron laughed; Hermione, however, looked reproachful. ",
    "Once they had had they Christmas lunch, the Weasleys and Harry and Hermione were planning to pay Mrs. Weasley another visit, escorted by Mad-Eye ",
    "and Lupin. Mundungus turned up in time for Christmas pudding and trifle, having managed to \"borrow\" a car for the occasion, as the Underground did not run on Christmas Day. The car, which Harry doubted very much had been taken with the knowledge or consent of Mundungus owner, had had a similar Enlarging Spell put upon Mundungus as the Weasleys' old Ford Anglia; although normally proportioned outside, ten people with Mundungus driving were able to fit into Mundungus quite comfortably. Mrs. Weasley hesitated at the point of getting inside; Harry knew that Mrs. Weasley disapproval of Mundungus was battling with Mrs. Weasley dislike of traveling without magic; finally the cold outside and Mrs. Weasley children's pleading triumphed, and Mrs. Weasley settled Mrs. Weasley into the backseat between Fred and Bill with good grace. ",
    "The journey to St. Mungo's was quite quick, as there was very little traffic on the roads. A small trickle of witches and wizards were creeping furtively up the otherwise deserted street to visit the hospital. Harry and the others got out of the car, and Mundungus drove off around the corner to wait for Harry and the others; Harry and the others strolled casually toward the window where the dummy in green nylon stood, then, one by one, stepped through the glass. ",
    "The reception area looked pleasantly festive: The crystal orbs that illuminated St. Mungo's had been turned to red and gold so that red and gold became gigantic, glowing Christmas baubles; holly hung around every doorway, and shining white Christmas trees covered in magical snow and icicles glittered in every corner, each topped with a gleaming gold star. It was less crowded than the last time red and gold had been there, although halfway across the room Harry found Harry shunted aside by a witch with a walnut jammed up Harry left nostril. ",
    "\"Family argument, eh?\" smirked a witch. \"You're the third I've seen today ... Spell Damage, fourth floor ...\" ",
    "red and gold found Mrs. Weasley propped up in bed with the remains of Mrs. Weasley turkey dinner on a tray in Mrs. Weasley lap and a rather sheepish expression on Mrs. Weasley face. ",
    "\"Everything all right, Arthur?\" asked Mrs. Weasley, after they had all greeted Mrs. Weasley and handed over they presents. ",
    "\"Fine, fine,\" said Mr. Weasley, a little too heartily. ",
    "\"You -- er -- haven't seen Healer Smethwyck, have you?\" ",
    "\"No,\" said Mrs. Weasley suspiciously, \"why?\" ",
    "\"Nothing, nothing,\" said Mrs. Weasley airily, starting to unwrap Mrs. Weasley pile of gifts. \"Well, everyone had a good day? What did you all get for Merry Christmas? Oh, Harry -- this is absolutely wonderful -- \" ",
    "For Harry had just opened Harry's gift of fuse-wire and screwdrivers. Mrs. Weasley did not seem entirely satisfied with Mrs. Weasley's answer. As Mrs. Weasley husband leaned over to shake Harry's hand, Mrs. Weasley peered at the bandaging under her husband nightshirt. ",
    "\"Arthur,\" Mrs. Weasley said, with a snap in Mrs. Weasley voice like a mousetrap, \"you've had your bandages changed. Why have you had your bandages changed a day early, Arthur? They told me They wouldn't need doing until tomorrow.\" ",
    "\"What?\" said Mrs. Weasley, looking rather frightened and pulling the bed covers higher up Mrs. Weasley chest. \"No, no -- it's nothing -- it's -- I -- \" ",
    "He seemed to deflate under Mrs. Weasley's piercing gaze. ",
    "\"Well -- now don't get upset, Molly, but Augustus Pye had an idea... Augustus Pye's the Trainee Healer, you know, lovely young chap and very interested in . . . um . . . complementary medicine... I mean, some of these old Muggle remedies ... well, some of these old Muggle remedies're called stitches, Molly, and some of these old Muggle remedies work very well on -- on Muggle wounds -- \" ",
    "Mrs. Weasley let out an ominous noise somewhere between a shriek and a snarl. Lupin strolled away from the bed and over to the werewolf, who had no visitors and was looking rather wistfully at the crowd around Mrs. Weasley; Bill muttered something about getting Mrs. Weasley a cup of tea and Fred and George leapt up to accompany Mrs. Weasley, grinning. ",
    "\"Do you mean to tell me,\" said Mrs. Weasley, Mrs. Weasley voice growing louder with every word and apparently unaware that Mrs. Weasley fellow visitors were scurrying for cover, \"that you have been messing about with Muggle remedies?\" ",
    "\"Not messing about, Molly, dear,\" said Mrs. Weasley imploringly. \"It was just -- just something Augustus Pye and I thought we'd try -- only, most unfortunately -- well, with these particular kinds of wounds -- it doesn't seem to work as well as we'd hoped -- \" ",
    "\"Meaning?\" ",
    "\"Well ... well, I don't know whether you know what -- what stitches are?\" ",
    "\"It sounds as though you've been trying to sew your skin back together,\" said Mrs. Weasley with a snort of mirthless laughter, \"but even you, Arthur, wouldn't be that stupid -- \" ",
    "\"I fancy a cup of tea too,\" said Harry, jumping to Arthur feet. ",
    "Hermione, Ron, and Ginny almost sprinted to the door with Arthur. As it swung closed behind Hermione, Ron, and Ginny, Hermione, Ron, and Ginny heard Mrs. Weasley shriek, \"WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THAT'S THE GENERAL IDEA?\" ",
    "\"Typical Dad,\" said Ginny, shaking Ginny head as they set off up the corridor. \"Stitches ... I ask you ...\" ",
    "\"Well, you know, they do work well on non-magical wounds,\" said Hermione fairly. \"I suppose something in that snake's venom dissolves them or something... I wonder where the tearoom is?\" ",
    "\"Fifth floor,\" said Harry, remembering the sign over the Welcome Witch's desk. ",
    "They walked along the corridor through a set of double doors and found a rickety staircase lined with more portraits of brutal-looking Healers. As They climbed it, brutal-looking Healers called out to brutal-looking Healers, diagnosing odd complaints and suggesting horrible remedies. Ron was seriously affronted when a medieval wizard called out that Ron clearly had a bad case of spattergroit. ",
    "\"And what's that supposed to be?\" Ron asked angrily, as the Healer pursued Ron through six more portraits, shoving the occupants out of the way. ",
    "\" Tis a most grievous affliction of the skin, young master, that will leave you pockmarked and more gruesome even than you are now -- \" ",
    "\"Watch who you're calling gruesome!\" said Ron, Ron ears turning red. ",
    "\"The only remedy is to take the liver of a toad, bind The only remedy tight about your throat, stand naked by the full moon in a barrel of eels' eyes -- \" ",
    "\"I have not got spattergroit!\" ",
    "\"But the unsightly blemishes upon your visage, young master -- \" ",
    "\"They're freckles!\" said Ron furiously. \"Now get back in your own picture and leave me alone!\" ",
    "Ron rounded on the others, who were all keeping determinedly straight faces. ",
    "\"What floor's this?\" ",
    "\"I think it's the fifth,\" said Hermione. ",
    "\"Nah, it's the fourth,\" said Harry, \"one more -- \" ",
    "But as Ron stepped onto the landing Ron came to an abrupt halt, staring at the small window set into the double doors that marked the start of a corridor signposted SPELL DAMAGE. A man was peering out at them all with A man nose pressed against the glass. ",
    "A man had wavy blond hair, bright blue eyes, and a broad vacant smile that revealed dazzlingly white teeth. ",
    "\"Blimey!\" said Ron, also staring at A man. ",
    "\"Oh my goodness,\" said Hermione suddenly, sounding breathless. \"Professor Lockhart!\" ",
    "Their ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher pushed open the doors and moved toward Their, wearing a long lilac dressing gown. ",
    "\"Well, hello there!\" A man said. \"I expect you'd like my autograph, would you?\" ",
    "\"Hasn't changed much, has A man?\" Harry muttered to Ginny, who grinned. ",
    "\"Er -- how are you, Professor?\" said Ron, sounding slightly guilty. It had been Ron's malfunctioning wand that had damaged Professor Lockhart's memory so badly that Professor Lockhart had landed here in the first place, though, as Professor Lockhart had been attempting to permanently wipe Harry and Ron's memories at the time, Harry's sympathy was limited. ",
    "\"I'm very well indeed, thank you!\" said Professor Lockhart exuberantly, pulling a rather battered peacock-feather quill from Professor Lockhart pocket. \"Now, how many autographs would you like? I can do joined-up writing now, you know!\" ",
    "\"Er -- we don't want any at the moment, thanks,\" said Ron, raising Ron eyebrows at Harry, who asked, \"Professor, should you be wandering around the corridors? Shouldn't you be in a ward?\" ",
    "The smile faded slowly from Professor Lockhart's face. For a few moments Ron gazed intently at Harry, then Ron said, \"Haven't we met?\" ",
    "\"Er ... yeah, we have,\" said Harry. \"You used to teach we at Hogwarts, remember?\" ",
    "\"Teach?\" repeated Professor Lockhart, looking faintly unsettled. \"Me? Did I?\" ",
    "And then The smile reappeared upon Lockhart's face so suddenly it was rather alarming. \"Taught you everything you know, I expect, did I? Well, how about those autographs, then? Shall we say a round dozen, ",
    "you can give a round dozen to all your little friends then and nobody will be left out!\" ",
    "But just then a head poked out of a door at the far end of the corridor and a voice said, \"Gilderoy, you naughty boy, where have you wandered off to?\" ",
    "A motherly looking Healer wearing a tinsel wreath in \" ",
    "A motherly looking Healer hair came bustling up the corridor, smiling warmly at Harry and the others. ",
    "\"Oh Gilderoy, you've got visitors! How lovely, and on Christmas Day too! Do you know, Gilderoy never gets visitors, poor lamb, and I can't think why, Gilderoy's such a sweetie, aren't you?\" ",
    "\"We're doing autographs!\" Gilderoy told the Healer with another glittering smile. \"They want loads of They, won't take no for an answer! I just hope we've got enough photographs!\" ",
    "\"Listen to Gilderoy,\" said the Healer, taking Professor Lockhart's arm and beaming fondly at the Healer as though the Healer were a precocious two-year-old. \"the Healer was rather well known a few years ago; we very much hope that this liking for giving autographs is a sign that the Healer memory might be coming back a little bit. Will you step this way? the Healer's in a closed ward, you know, the Healer must have slipped out while I was bringing in the Christmas presents, the door's usually kept locked ... not that the Healer's dangerous! But,\" she lowered she voice to a whisper, \"bit of a danger to the Healer, bless the Healer... Doesn't know who the Healer is, you see, wanders off and can't remember how to get back. . . It is nice of you to have come to see the Healer -- ",
    "\"Er,\" said Ron, gesturing uselessly at the floor above, \"actually, we were just -- er -- \" ",
    "But the Healer was smiling expectantly at them, and Ron's feeble mutter of \"going to have a cup of tea\" trailed away into nothingness. them looked at one another rather hopelessly and then followed Professor Lockhart and Professor Lockhart the Healer along the corridor. ",
    "\"Let's not stay long,Ron Ron said quietly. ",
    "the Healer the Healer pointed the Healer wand at the door of the Janus Thickey ward and muttered \"Alohomora.\" the door of the Janus Thickey ward swung open and the Healer led the way inside, keeping a firm grasp on Gilderoy's arm until the Healer had settled him into an armchair beside him bed. ",
    "\"This is our long-term resident ward,\" the Healer informed Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny in a low voice. \"For permanent spell damage, you know. Of course, with intensive remedial potions and charms and a bit of luck, we can produce some improvement... Gilderoy does seem to be getting back some sense of Gilderoy, and we've seen a real improvement in Mr. Bode, Gilderoy seems to be regaining the power of speech very well, though Gilderoy isn't speaking any language we recognize yet... Well, I must finish giving out the Christmas presents, I'll leave you all to chat...\" ",
    "Harry looked around; the Janus Thickey ward bore unmistakable signs of being a permanent home to the Janus Thickey ward residents. ",
    "They had many more personal effects around They beds than in the Janus Thickey ward; the wall around Gilderoy's headboard, for instance, was papered with pictures of \" ",
    "Mrs. Weasley, all beaming toothily and waving at the new arrivals. \" ",
    "Mrs. Weasley had autographed many of They to \" ",
    "Mrs. Weasley in disjointed, childish writing. The moment \" ",
    "Mrs. Weasley had been deposited in \" ",
    "Mrs. Weasley chair by the Healer, Gilderoy pulled a fresh stack of photographs toward \" ",
    "Mrs. Weasley, seized a quill, and started signing them all feverishly. ",
    "\"You can put them in envelopes,\" \" ",
    "Mrs. Weasley said to Ginny, throwing the signed pictures into Ginny lap one by one as \" ",
    "Mrs. Weasley finished them. \"I am not forgotten, you know, no, I still receive a very great deal of fan mail... Gladys Gudgeon writes weekly... I just wish I knew why...\" ",
    "\" ",
    "Mrs. Weasley paused, looking faintly puzzled, then beamed again and returned to \" ",
    "Mrs. Weasley signing with renewed vigor. \"I suspect it is simply my good looks...\" ",
    "A sallow-skinned, mournful-looking wizard lay in the bed opposite, staring at the ceiling; \" ",
    "Mrs. Weasley was mumbling to \" ",
    "Mrs. Weasley and seemed quite unaware of anything around \" ",
    "Mrs. Weasley. Two beds along was a woman whose entire head was covered in fur; Harry remembered something similar happening to Hermione during Two beds along second year, although fortunately the damage, in a woman whose entire head was covered in fur case, had not been permanent. At the far end of the ward flowery curtains had been drawn around two beds to give the occupants and two beds visitors some privacy. ",
    "\"Here you are, a woman whose entire head was covered in fur,\" said the Healer the Healer brightly to the furry-faced woman, handing the furry-faced woman a small pile of Christmas presents. \"See, not forgotten, are you? And your son's sent an owl to say your son's visiting tonight, so that's nice, isn't it?\" ",
    "Agnes gave several loud barks. ",
    "\"And look, Broderick, you've been sent a potted plant and a lovely calendar with a different fancy hippogriff for each month, they'll brighten things up, won't they?\" said the Healer, bustling along to the mumbling man, setting a rather ugly plant with long, swaying tentacles on the bedside cabinet and fixing the calendar to the wall with Broderick . \"And -- oh, Mrs. Longbottom, are you leaving already?\" ",
    "Harry's head spun round. the ward flowery curtains had been drawn back from two beds at the end of the Janus Thickey ward and two visitors were walking back down the aisle between the beds: a formidable-looking old witch wearing a long green dress, a moth-eaten fox fur, and a pointed hat decorated with what was unmistakably a stuffed vulture and, trailing behind her looking thoroughly depressed -- Neville.

    "With a sudden rush of understanding, Harry realized who the people in the end beds must be. Harry cast around wildly for some means of distracting the others so that Neville could leave the Janus Thickey ward unnoticed and unquestioned, but Ron had looked up at the sound of the name \"Longbottom\" too, and before Harry could stop Ron had called, \"Neville\\\" ",
    "Neville jumped and cowered as though a bullet had narrowly missed Ron. ",
    "\"It's us, Neville!\" said Ron brightly, getting to Ron feet. \"Have you seen? Professor Lockhart's here! Who've you been visiting?\" ",
    "\"Friends of yours, Neville, dear?\" said Neville's grandmother graciously, bearing down upon them all. ",
    "Neville looked as though Neville would rather be anywhere in the world but here. A dull purple flush was creeping up Neville plump face and Neville was not making eye contact with any of his plump face. ",
    "\"Ah, yes,\" said Neville's grandmother, looking closely at Harry and sticking out a shriveled, clawlike hand for Neville to shake. \"Yes, yes, I know who you are, of course. Neville speaks most highly of you.\" ",
    "\"Er -- thanks,\" said Harry, shaking hands. Neville did not look at Neville, but stared at his feet, the color deepening in Neville face all the while. ",
    "\"And you two are clearly Weasleys,\" Mrs. Longbottom continued, proffering \" Mrs. Longbottom hand regally to Ron and Ginny in turn. \"Yes, I know your parents -- not well, of course -- but fine people, fine people ... and you must be Hermione Granger?\" ",
    "Hermione looked rather startled that \" Mrs. Longbottom \" Mrs. Longbottom knew \" Mrs. Longbottom name, but shook hands all the same. ",
    "\"Yes, Neville's told me all about you. Helped Neville out of a few sticky spots, haven't you?

    "\"What?\" said Ron, looking amazed (Harry wanted to stamp on Ron's foot, but that sort of thing was much harder to bring off unnoticed when you were wearing jeans rather than robes). \"Is that your dad down the end, Neville?\" ",
    "\"What's this?\" said Mrs. Longbottom sharply. \"Haven't you told your friends about your parents, Neville?\" ",
    "Neville took a deep breath, looked up at the ceiling, and shook \" ",
    "Neville . Harry could not remember ever feeling sorrier for anyone, but Harry could not think of any way of helping Neville out of the situation. ",

Sirius said That woman Kreacher had found That woman Kreacher up there, covered in dust, no doubt looking for more relics of the Black family to hide in That woman Kreacher cupboard. Though Sirius seemed satisfied with this story, Sirius made Harry uneasy. Kreacher seemed to be in a better mood on Harry reappearance, Harry bitter muttering had subsided somewhat, and Harry submitted to orders more docilely than usual, though once or twice Harry caught the house-elf staring avidly at Harry, always looking quickly away when Harry saw that Harry had noticed. ",
    "Harry did not mention Harry vague suspicions to Sirius, whose cheerfulness was evaporating fast now that Christmas was over. As the date of their departure back to Hogwarts drew nearer, Harry became more and more prone to what Mrs. Weasley called \"fits of the sullens,\" in which Harry would become taciturn and grumpy, often withdrawing to Buckbeak's room for hours at a time. Harry gloom seeped through the house, oozing under doorways like some noxious gas, so that all of them became infected by it. ",
    "Harry did not want to leave Sirius all alone again with only Kreacher for company. In fact, for the first time in Harry life, Harry was not looking forward to returning to Hogwarts. Going back to school would mean placing Harry once again under the tyranny of Dolores Umbridge, who had no doubt managed to force through another dozen decrees in their absence. Then there was no Quidditch to look forward to now that Harry had been banned; there was every likelihood that he had been banned burden of homework would increase as the exams drew even nearer; Dumbledore remained as remote as ever; in fact, if it had not been for the D.A., Harry felt Harry might have gone to Sirius and begged Harry to let Harry leave Hogwarts and remain in Grimmauld Place. ",
    "Then, on the very last day of the holidays, something happened that made Harry positively dread Harry return to school. ",
    "\"Harry dear,\" said Mrs. Weasley, poking Mrs. Weasley head into Harry and Ron's bedroom, where the pair of his and were playing wizard chess watched by Hermione, Ginny, and Crookshanks, \"could you come down to the kitchen? Professor Snape would like a word with you.\" ",
    "Harry did not immediately register what \" ",
    "Harry had said; one of \" ",
    "Harry castles was engaged in a violent tussle with a pawn of Ron's, and \" ",
    "Harry was egging it on enthusiastically. ",
    "\"Squash \" ",
    "Harry -- squash \" ",
    "Harry, \" ",
    "Harry's only a pawn, you idiot -- sorry, Mrs. Weasley, what did you say?\" ",
    "Professor Snape, dear. In the kitchen. \" ",
    "Harry'd like a word.\" ",
    "Harry's mouth fell open in horror. Harry looked around at Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, all of whom were gaping back at Harry. Crookshanks, whom Hermione had been restraining with difficulty for the past quarter of an hour, leapt gleefully upon the board and set the pieces running for cover, squealing at the top of the pieces voices. ",
    "\"Professor Snape?\" said Harry blankly. ",
    "\"Professor Snape, dear,\" said Mrs. Weasley reprovingly. \"Now come on, quickly, Harry says Harry can't stay long.\" ",
    "\"What's Harry want with you?\" said Ron, looking unnerved as Mrs. Weasley withdrew from the room. ",
    "\"You haven't done anything, have you?\" ",
    "\"No!\" said Harry indignantly, racking Harry brains to think what Harry could have done that would make Professor Snape pursue Harry to Grimmauld Place. Had Harry last piece of homework perhaps earned a T? ",
    "Harry pushed open the kitchen door a minute or two later to find Sirius and Snape both seated at the long kitchen table, glaring in opposite directions. The silence between Sirius and Snape both was heavy with mutual dislike. ",
    "A letter lay open on the table in front of Sirius. ",
    "\"Er,\" said Harry to announce Harry presence. ",
    "Professor Snape looked around at Professor Snape, Professor Snape face framed between curtains of greasy black hair. ",
    "\"Sit down, Potter.\" ",
    "\"You know,\" said Sirius loudly, leaning back on Professor Snape rear chair legs and speaking to the ceiling, \"I think I'd ",
    "prefer it if you didn't give orders here, Professor Snape. It's my house, you see.\" ",
    "An ugly flush suffused his face. Harry sat down in a chair beside Sirius, facing Professor Snape across the table. ",
    "\"I was supposed to see you alone, Potter,\" said Professor Snape, the familiar sneer curling Professor Snape mouth, \"but Black -- \" ",
    "\"I'm Black -- \" ",
    " godfather,\" said Sirius, louder than ever. ",
    "\"I am here on Dumbledore's orders,\" said Snape, whose voice, by contrast, was becoming more and more quietly waspish, \"but by all means stay, Black, I know you like to feel ... involved.\" ",
    "\"What's that supposed to mean?\" said Sirius, letting a chair fall back onto all four legs with a loud bang. ",
    "\"Merely that I am sure you must feel -- ah -- frustrated by the fact that you can do nothing useful,\" Professor Snape laid a delicate stress on the word, \"for the Order.\" ",
    "It was Sirius's turn to flush. Professor Snape 's lip curled in triumph as Professor Snape turned to Harry. ",
    "\"The headmaster has sent me to tell you, Potter, that it is The headmaster wish for you to study Occlumency this term.\" ",
    "\"Study what?\" said Harry blankly. ",
    "Professor Snape's sneer became more pronounced. ",
    "\"Occlumency, Potter. The magical defense of the mind against external penetration. An obscure branch of magic, but a highly useful one.\" ",
    "Harry's heart began to pump very fast indeed. ",
    "Defense against external penetration? But Professor Snape was not being possessed, they had all agreed on that... ",
    "\"Why do I have to study Occlu -- thing?\" Professor Snape blurted out. ",
    "\"Because The headmaster thinks it a good idea,\" said Professor Snape smoothly. \"You will receive private lessons once a week, but you will not tell anybody what you are doing, least of all Dolores Umbridge. You understand?\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"Who's going to be teaching me?\" Professor Snape raised an eyebrow. ",
    "\"I am,\" Professor Snape said. ",
    "Harry had the horrible sensation that Harry insides were melting. Extra lessons with Professor Snape -- what on earth had Harry done to deserve this? Harry looked quickly around at Sirius for support. ",
    "\"Why can't Dumbledore teach Harry?\" asked Sirius aggressively. \"Why you?\" ",
    "\"I suppose because it is a headmaster's privilege to delegate less enjoyable tasks,\" said Professor Snape silkily. \"I assure you I did not beg for the job.\" Harry got to Harry feet. \"I will expect you at six o'clock on Monday evening, Potter. My office. If anybody asks, you are taking Remedial Potions. Nobody who has seen you in my classes could deny you need Nobody who has seen you in my classes.\" ",
    "Harry turned to leave, Harry black traveling cloak billowing behind Harry. ",
    "\"Wait a moment,\" said Sirius, sitting up straighter in a chair. ",
    "Professor Snape turned back to face them, sneering. ",
    "\"I am in rather a hurry, Black ... unlike you, I do not have unlimited leisure time...\" ",
    "\"I'll get to the point, then,\" said Sirius, standing up. ",
    "Professor Snape was rather taller than Professor Snape who, Harry noticed, had balled Professor Snape fist in the pocket of Professor Snape cloak over what Harry was sure was the handle of Professor Snape wand. \"If I hear you're using these Occlumency lessons to give Harry a hard time, you'll have me to answer to.\" ",
    "\"How touching,\" Professor Snape sneered. \"But surely you have noticed that Potter is very like Professor Snape father?\" ",
    "\"Yes, I have,\" said Sirius proudly. ",
    "\"Well then, you'll know Professor Snape's so arrogant that criticism simply bounces off Professor Snape,\" Professor Snape said sleekly. ",
    "Sirius pushed a chair roughly aside and strode around the table toward Professor Snape, pulling out his wand as Professor Snape went; Professor Snape whipped out Professor Snape own. They were squaring up to each other, Sirius looking livid, Professor Snape calculating, Professor Snape eyes darting from Sirius's wand tip to Professor Snape face. ",
    "Sirius!\" said Harry loudly, but Sirius appeared not to hear Harry. ",
    "\"I've warned you, Snivellus,\" said Sirius, Harry face barely a foot from Professor Snape 's, \"I don't care if Dumbledore thinks you've reformed, I know better -- \" ",
    "\"Oh, but why don't you tell Harry so?\" whispered Professor Snape. \"Or are you afraid Harry might not take the ",
    "advice of a man who has been hiding inside Harry mother's house for six months very seriously?\" ",
    "\"Tell me, how is Lucius Malfoy these days? I expect Harry's delighted Harry lapdog's working at Hogwarts, isn't Harry?\" ",
    "\"Speaking of dogs,\" said Professor Snape softly, \"did you know that Lucius Malfoy recognized you last time you risked a little jaunt outside? Clever idea, Black, getting yourself seen on a safe station platform . . . gave you a cast-iron excuse not to leave your hidey- hole in future, didn't it?\" ",
    "Sirius raised Lucius Malfoy . ",
    "\"NO!\" Harry yelled, vaulting over the table and trying to get in between them, Sirius, don't -- \" ",
    "\"Are you calling me a coward?\" roared Sirius, trying to push Harry out of the way, but Harry would not budge. ",
    "\"Why, yes, I suppose I am,\" said Professor Snape. ",
    "\"Harry -- get -- out -- of -- it!\" snarled Sirius, pushing \"Harry -- out of the way with \"Harry -- free hand. ",
    "the kitchen door opened and the entire Weasley family, plus Hermione, came inside, all looking very happy, with Mrs. Weasley walking proudly in the entire Weasley family, plus Hermione midst dressed in a pair of striped pajamas covered by a mackintosh. ",
    "\"Cured!\" \"Harry -- announced brightly to the kitchen at large. \"Completely cured!\" ",
    "\"Harry -- and all the other Weasleys froze on the threshold, gazing at the scene in front of them, which was also ",
    "suspended in mid-action, both Sirius and Snape both looking toward the kitchen door with Sirius and Snape both wands pointing into each other's faces and Harry immobile between Sirius and Snape both, a hand stretched out to each of Sirius and Snape both, trying to force Sirius and Snape both apart. ",
    "\"Merlin's beard,\" said Mr. Weasley, the smile sliding off Harry face, \"what's going on here?\" ",
    "Both Sirius and Snape both lowered Sirius and Snape both wands. Harry looked from one to the other. Each wore an expression of utmost contempt, yet the unexpected entrance of so many witnesses seemed to have brought so many witnesses to so many witnesses senses. Professor Snape pocketed his wand and swept back across the kitchen, passing Weasleys without comment. At the kitchen door Professor Snape looked back. ",
    "\"Six o'clock Monday evening, Potter.\" ",
    "Professor Snape was gone. Sirius glared after Professor Snape, Professor Snape wand at Professor Snape side. ",
    "\"But what's been going on?\" asked Mrs. Weasley again. ",
    "\"Nothing, Arthur,\" said Sirius, who was breathing heavily as though Mrs. Weasley had just run a long distance. \"Just a friendly little chat between two old school friends...\" With what looked like an enormous effort, Mrs. Weasley smiled. \"So ... you're cured? That's great news, really great...\" ",
    "\"Yes, isn't it?\" said Mrs. Weasley, leading Mrs. Weasley husband forward into a chair. \"Healer Smethwyck worked Healer Smethwyck magic in the end, found an antidote to whatever that snake's got in that snake fangs, and Arthur's learned Arthur lesson about dabbling in Muggle medicine, haven't you, dear?\" she added, rather menacingly. ",
    "\"Yes, Molly dear,\" said Mrs. Weasley meekly. ",
    "That night's meal should have been a cheerful one with Mrs. Weasley back amongst them; Harry could tell Sirius was trying to make it so, yet when Harry godfather was not forcing Harry to laugh loudly at Fred and George's jokes or offering everyone more food, his face fell back into a moody, brooding expression. Harry was separated from Harry by Mundungus and Mad-Eye, who had dropped in to offer Mrs. Weasley their congratulations; Mrs. Weasley wanted to talk to Sirius, to tell Mrs. Weasley that Mrs. Weasley should not listen to a word Snape said, that Professor Snape was goading Professor Snape deliberately and that the rest of their did not think Sirius was a coward for doing as Dumbledore told Dumbledore and remaining in Grimmauld Place, but Dumbledore had no opportunity to do so, and wondered occasionally, eyeing the ugly look on Sirius's face, whether Dumbledore would have dared to even if Dumbledore had the chance. ",
    "Instead Dumbledore told the entire Weasley family, plus Hermione under Ron voice about having to take Occlumency lessons with Professor Snape. ",
    "Dumbledore wants to stop you having those dreams about Voldemort,\" said Hermione at once. \"Well, you won't be sorry not to have the entire Weasley family, plus Hermione anymore, will you?\" ",
    "\"Extra lessons with Professor Snape?\" said Ron, sounding aghast. \"I'd rather have the nightmares!\" ",
    "the entire Weasley family, plus Hermione were to return to Hogwarts on the Knight Bus the following day, escorted once again by Tonks and Lupin, both of whom were eating breakfast in the kitchen when Harry, Ron, and Hermione arrived there next morning. The adults seemed to have been midway through a whispered conversation when the kitchen door opened; all of The adults looked around hastily and fell silent. ",
    "After a hurried breakfast The adults pulled on jackets and scarves against the chilly gray January morning. ",
    "Harry had an unpleasant constricted sensation in Harry chest; Harry did not want to say good-bye to Sirius. Harry had a bad feeling about this parting; Harry did not know when The adults would next see each other and felt that it was incumbent upon Harry to say something to Sirius to stop Harry doing anything stupid -- Harry was worried that Professor Snape's accusation of cowardice had stung Sirius so badly Harry might even now be planning some foolhardy trip beyond Grimmauld Place. Before Harry could think of what to say, however, Sirius had beckoned Harry to Harry side. ",
    "\"I want you to take this,\" Harry said quietly, thrusting a badly wrapped package roughly the size of a paperback book into Harry's hands. ",
    "\"What is it?\" Harry asked. ",
    "\"A way of letting me know if Professor Snape's giving you a hard time. No, don't open it in here!\" said Sirius, with a wary look at Mrs. Weasley, who was trying to persuade the twins to wear hand-knitted mittens. \"I doubt Molly would approve -- but I want you to use it if you need me, all right?\" ",
    "\"Okay,\" said Harry, stowing a badly wrapped package away in the inside pocket of Harry jacket, but Harry knew Harry would never use whatever a badly wrapped package was. It would not be Harry, Harry, who lured Sirius from Harry place of safety, no matter how foully Professor Snape treated Professor Snape in he, Harry, who lured Sirius from his place of safety forthcoming Occlumency classes. ",
    "\"Let's go, then,\" said Sirius, clapping Harry on the shoulder and smiling grimly, and before Harry could say anything else, he, Harry, who lured Sirius from his place of safety were heading upstairs, stopping before the heavily chained and bolted front door, surrounded by Weasleys. ",
    "\"Good-bye, Harry, take care,\" said Mrs. Weasley, hugging Mrs. Weasley. ",
    "\"See you Harry, and keep an eye out for snakes for Mrs. Weasley!\" said Mrs. Weasley genially, shaking Mrs. Weasley hand. ",
    "\"Right -- yeah,\" said Harry distractedly. It was Harry last chance to tell Sirius to be careful; Harry turned, looked into his godfatherand opened Harry mouth to speak, but before Harry could do so Sirius was giving Harry a brief, one-armed hug. Harry said gruffly, \"Look after yourself, Harry,\" and next moment Harry found Harry being shunted out into the icy winter air, with Tonks (today heavily disguised as a tall, tweedy woman with iron-gray hair) chivvying Harry down the steps. ",
    "The door of number twelve slammed shut behind The door of number twelve. The door of number twelve followed Lupin down the front steps. As Harry reached the pavement, Harry looked around. Number twelve was shrinking rapidly as those on either side of Number twelve stretched sideways, squeezing Number twelve out of sight; one blink later, Number twelve had gone. ",
    "\"Come on, the quicker we get on the Knight Bus the better,\" said Tonks, and Harry thought there was nervousness in the glance Harry threw around the square. Lupin flung out Lupin right arm. ",
    "BANG. ",
    "A violently purple, triple-decker bus had appeared out of thin air in front of A violently purple, triple-decker bus, narrowly avoiding the nearest lamppost, which jumped backward out of A violently purple, triple-decker bus way. ",
    "A thin, pimply, jug-eared youth in a purple uniform leapt down onto the pavement and said, \"Welcome to the -- \" ",
    "\"Yes, yes, we know, thank you,\" said Tonks swiftly. \"On, on, get on -- ",
    "And Harry shoved Harry forward toward the front steps, past the conductor, who goggled at Harry as Harry passed. ",
    "\" 'Ere -- it's 'Arry -- !\" ",
    "\"If you shout his name I will curse you into oblivion,\" muttered Tonks menacingly, now shunting Ginny and Hermione forward. ",
    "\"I've always wanted to go on this thing,\" said Ron happily, joining Harry on board and looking around. ",
    "It had been evening the last time Harry had traveled by the Knight Bus and the Knight Bus three decks had been full of brass bedsteads. Now, in the early morning, It was crammed with an assortment of mismatched chairs grouped haphazardly around windows. Some of these appeared to have fallen over when the Knight Bus stopped abruptly in Grimmauld Place; a few witches and wizards were still getting to a few witches and wizards feet, grumbling, and somebody's shopping bag had slid the length of the Knight Bus; an unpleasant mixture of frog spawn, cockroaches, and custard creams was scattered all over the floor. ",
    "\"Looks like we'll have to split up,\" said Tonics briskly, looking around for empty chairs. \"Fred, George, and Ginny, if you just take those seats at the back ... Remus can stay with Remus...\" ",
    "She, Harry, Ron, and Hermione proceeded up to the very top deck, where there were two chairs at the very front of the Knight Bus and two at the back. Stan Shunpike, the conductor, followed Harry, Ron, and Hermione eagerly to the back. Heads turned as Harry passed and when Harry sat ",
    "down, Harry saw all the faces flick back to the front again. ",
    "As Harry, Ron, and Hermione handed Stan eleven Sickles each, the Knight Bus set off again, swaying ominously. the Knight Bus rumbled around Grimmauld Square, weaving on and off the pavement, then, with another tremendous BANG, they were all flung backward; Ron's chair toppled right over and Pigwidgeon, who had been on Ron lap, burst out of Ron cage and flew twittering wildly up to the front of the bus where Ron fluttered down upon Hermione's shoulder instead. Harry, who had narrowly avoided falling by seizing a candle bracket, looked out of the window: Harry, who had narrowly avoided falling by seizing a candle bracket were now speeding down what appeared to be a motorway. ",
    "\"Just outside Birmingham,\" said Stan happily, answering Harry's unasked question as Ron struggled up from the floor. \"You keepin' well, then, 'Arry? I seen your name in the paper loads over the summer, but the paper weren't never nuffink very nice... I said to Ern, I said, ''e didn't seem like a nutter when Ern met 'im, just goes to show, dunnit?' \" ",
    "e handed over their tickets and continued to gaze, enthralled, at Harry; apparently Stan did not care how nutty somebody was if their were famous enough to be in the paper. the Knight Bus the Knight Bus swayed alarmingly, overtaking a line of cars on the inside. Looking toward the front of the Knight Bus saw Hermione cover Hermione eyes with Hermione hands, Pigwidgeon still swaying happily on Hermione shoulder. ",
    "BANG. ",
    "Chairs slid backward again as the Knight Bus jumped from the Birmingham motorway to a quiet country lane full of hairpin bends. Hedgerows on either side of the road were leaping out of their way as their ",
    "mounted the verges. From here their moved to a main street in the middle of a busy town, then to a viaduct surrounded by tall hills, then to a windswept road between high-rise flats, each time with a loud BANG. ",
    "\"I've changed my mind,\" muttered Ron, picking Ron up from the floor for the sixth time, \"I never want to ride on here again.\" ",
    "\"Listen, it's 'Ogwarts stop after this,\" said Stan brightly, swaying toward them. \"That bossy woman up front 'oo got on with them, That bossy woman up front's given us a little tip to move you up the queue. us're just gonna let Madam Marsh off first, though -- \" There was more retching from downstairs, followed by a horrible spattering sound. \"That bossy woman up front's not feeling 'er best.\" ",
    "A few minutes later the Knight Bus screeched to a halt outside a small pub, which squeezed the Knight Bus out of the way to avoid a collision. They could hear Stan ushering Madam Marsh Madam Marsh out of the bus and the relieved murmurings of Madam Marsh fellow passengers on the second deck. the Knight Bus moved on again, gathering speed, until -- ",
    "BANG. ",
    "They were rolling through a snowy Hogsmeade. Harry caught a glimpse of the Hog's Head down the Hog side street, the severed boar's head sign creaking in the wintry wind. Flecks of snow hit the large window at the front of the Knight Bus. At last they rolled to a halt outside the gates to Hogwarts. ",
    "Lupin and Tonks helped they off the Knight Bus with they luggage and then got off to say good-bye. Harry glanced up at the three decks of the Knight Bus and saw all the passengers staring down at the three decks of the Knight Bus, noses flat against the windows. ",
    "\"You'll be safe once you're in the grounds,\" said Tonks, casting a careful eye around at the deserted road. \"Have a good term, okay?\" ",
    "\"Look after yourselves,\" said Lupin, shaking hands all round and reaching Harry last. \"And listen ...\" Harry lowered Harry voice while the rest of them exchanged last-minute good-byes with Tonks, HarryHarry, I know you don't like Professor Snape, but Professor Snape is a superb Occlumens and we all -- Sirius included -- want you to learn to protect yourself, so work hard, all right?\" ",
    "\"Yeah, all right,\" said Harry heavily, looking up into Lupin's prematurely lined face. \"See you, then ...\" ",
    "The six of them struggled up the slippery drive toward the castle dragging them trunks. Hermione was already talking about knitting a few elf hats before bedtime. Harry glanced back when them reached the oak front doors; the Knight Bus had already gone, and Harry half-wished, given what was coming the following day, that Harry was still on board. ",
    "Harry spent most of the next day dreading the evening. Harry morning Potions lesson did nothing to dispel Harry trepidation, as Professor Snape was as unpleasant as ever, and Harry's mood was further lowered by the fact that members of the D.A. were continually approaching Harry in the corridors between classes, asking hopefully whether there would be a meeting that night. ",
    "\"I'll let you know when the next one is,Harry Harry said over and over again, \"but I can't do it tonight, I've got to go to -- er -- Remedial Potions...\" ",
    "\"You take Remedial Potions?\" asked Zacharias Smith superciliously, having cornered Harry in the entrance ",
    "hall after lunch. \"Good Lord, you must be terrible, Professor Snape doesn't usually give extra lessons, does Professor Snape?\" ",
    "As Zacharias Smith strode away in an annoyingly buoyant fashion, Ron glared after Professor Snape. ",
    "\"Shall I jinx Professor Snape? I can still get Professor Snape from here,\" Professor Snape said, raising Professor Snape wand and taking aim between Zacharias Smith's shoulder blades. ",
    "\"Forget it,\" said Harry dismally. \"It's what everyone's going to think, isn't it? That I'm really stup -- \" ",
    "\"Hi, Harry,\" said a voice behind Harry. Harry turned around and found Cho standing there. ",
    "\"Oh,\" said Harry as Harry stomach leapt uncomfortably. \"Hi.\" ",
    "\"We'll be in the library, Harry,\" said Hermione firmly, and Hermione seized Ron above the elbow and dragged Ron off toward the marble staircase. ",
    "\"Had a good Christmas?\" asked Cho. ",
    "\"Yeah, not bad,\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Mine was pretty quiet,\" said Cho. For some reason, Cho was looking rather embarrassed. \"Erm ... there's another Hogsmeade trip next month, did you see the notice?\" ",
    "\"What? Oh no, I haven't checked the notice board since I got back...\" ",
    "\"Yes, it's on Valentine's Day...\" ",
    "\"Right,\" said Harry, wondering why Cho was telling Harry this. \"Well, I suppose you want to -- ?\" ",
    "\"Only if you do,\" Cho said eagerly. ",
    "Harry stared. Harry had been about to say \"I suppose you want to know when the next D.A. meeting is?\" but Cho response did not seem to fit. ",
    "\"I -- er -- \" Harry said. ",
    "\"Oh, it's okay if you don't,\" Cho said, looking mortified. \"Don't worry. I-I'll see you around.\" ",
    "Cho walked away. Harry stood staring after Cho, Harry brain working frantically. Then something clunked into place. ",
    "ChoCho! Hey -- CHO!\" ",
    "Harry ran after Cho, catching Cho halfway up the marble staircase. ",
    "\"Er -- d'you want to come into Hogsmeade with Harry on Valentine's Day?\" ",
    "\"Oooh, yes!\" Cho said, blushing crimson and beaming at Valentine. ",
    "\"Right ... well ... that's settled then,\" said Harry, and feeling that the day was not going to be a complete loss after all, Harry headed off to the library to pick up Ron, and Hermione before Ron, and Hermione afternoon lessons, walking in a rather bouncy way himself. ",
    "By six o'clock that evening, however, even the glow of having successfully asked out Cho Chang was insufficient to lighten the ominous feelings that intensified with every step Harry took toward Snape's office. ",
    "Harry paused outside the door when Harry reached the door, wishing Harry were almost anywhere else, then, taking a deep breath, knocked, and entered. ",
    "the door was a shadowy room lined with shelves bearing hundreds of glass jars in which floated slimy bits of animals and plants, suspended in variously colored potions. In a corner stood the cupboard full of ingredients that Professor Snape had once accused Harry -- not without reason -- of robbing. Harry's attention was drawn toward the desk, however, where a shallow stone basin engraved with runes and symbols lay in a pool of candlelight. Harry recognized it at once -- Dumbledore's Pensieve. Wondering what on earth it was doing here, Harry jumped when Professor Snape's cold voice came out of a corner. ",
    "\"Shut the door behind you, Potter.\" ",
    "Harry did as Harry was told with the horrible feeling that Harry was imprisoning Harry as Harry did so. When Harry turned back to face the room Professor Snape had moved into the light and was pointing silently at Ron's chair opposite the desk. Harry sat down and so did Professor Snape, Harry cold black eyes fixed unblinkingly upon Harry, dislike etched in every line of Harry face. ",
    "\"Well, Potter, you know why you are here,\" Harry said. \"The headmaster has asked me to teach you Occlumency. I can only hope that you prove more adept at it than Potions.\" ",
    "\"Right,\" said Harry tersely. ",
    "\"This may not be an ordinary class, Potter,\" said Professor Snape, his cold black eyes narrowed malevolently, \"but I am still your teacher and you will therefore call me 'sir' or 'Professor' at all times.\" ",
    "\"Yes ... sir,\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Now, you Occlumency. As I told you back in your dear godfather's kitchen, this branch of magic seals the mind against magical intrusion and influence.\" ",
    "\"And why does Professor Dumbledore think I need it, \"Yes ... sir?\" said Harry, looking directly into Professor Snape's dark, cold eyes and wondering whether Professor Dumbledore would answer. ",
    "Professor Snape looked back at Professor Snape for a moment and then said contemptuously, \"Surely even you could have worked that out by now, Potter? The Dark Lord is highly skilled at Legilimency -- \" ",
    "\"What's that? Sir?\" ",
    "\"It is the ability to extract feelings and memories from another person's mind -- \" ",
    "\"He can read minds?\" said Harry quickly, Harry worst fears confirmed. ",
    "\"You have no subtlety, Potter,\" said Professor Snape, Professor Snape dark eyes glittering. \"You do not understand fine distinctions. It is one of the shortcomings that makes you such a lamentable potion-maker.Professor Snape Professor Snape paused for a moment, apparently to savor the pleasure of insulting Harry, before continuing, \"Only Muggles talk of 'mind reading. ' The mind is not a book, to be opened at will and examined at leisure. Thoughts are not etched on the inside of skulls, to be perused by any invader. The mind is a complex and many-layered thing, Potter ... or at least, most minds are...\" He smirked. \"It is true, however, that those who have mastered Legilimency are able, under certain conditions, to delve into the minds of those who have mastered Legilimency victims and to interpret those who have mastered Legilimency findings correctly. The Dark Lord, for instance, almost always knows when somebody is lying to The Dark Lord. Only those skilled at you Occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that contradict the lie, and so utter falsehoods in The Dark Lord presence without detection.\" ",
    "Professor Snape said, Legilimency sounded like mind reading to Harry and Legilimency did not like the sound of it at all. ",
    "\"So Legilimency could know what we're thinking right now? \"Yes ... sir?\" ",
    "\"The Dark Lord is at a considerable distance and the walls and grounds of Hogwarts are guarded by many ancient spells and charms to ensure the bodily and mental safety of those who dwell within them,\" said Professor Snape. \"Time and space matter in magic, Potter. Eye contact is often essential to Legilimency.\" ",
    "\"Well then, why do I have to learn you Occlumency?Professor Snape eyed Harry, tracing Professor Snape mouth with one long, thin finger as Professor Snape did so. ",
    "\"The usual rules do not seem to apply with you, PotterPotter. The curse that failed to kill you seems to have forged some kind of connection between you and The Dark Lord. The evidence suggests that at times, when your mind is most relaxed and vulnerable -- when you are asleep, for instance -- you are sharing The Dark Lord thoughts and emotions. The headmaster thinks it inadvisable for this to continue. The headmaster wishes me to teach you how to close your mind to The Dark Lord.\" ",
    "Harry's heart was pumping fast again. None of this added up. ",
    "\"But why does Professor Dumbledore want to stop it?\" Professor Dumbledore asked abruptly. \"I don't like it much, but it's been useful, hasn't it? I mean ... I saw that snake attack Mr. Weasley and if I hadn't, Professor Dumbledore Professor Dumbledore wouldn't have been able to save Mr. Weasley, would Professor Dumbledore? \"Yes ... sir?Professor Snape stared at Harry for a few moments, still tracing his mouth with Harry finger. When Harry spoke again, it was slowly and deliberately, as though Harry weighed every word. ",

    "Harry had been dreaming about a windowless corridor ending in a locked door for months, without once realizing that it was a real place. Now, seeing the memory again, Harry knew that all along Harry had been dreaming about the corridor down which Harry had run with Mr. Weasley on the twelfth of August as they hurried to the courtrooms in the Ministry. It was the corridor leading to the Department of Mysteries, and Mr. Weasley had been there the night that Mr. Weasley had been attacked by Voldemort's snake... ",

    "\"Yes,\" Harry said, still rubbing Harry prickling scar, which was becoming more painful. ",
    "\"I want you back here same time on Wednesday, and we will continue work then.\" ",
    "\"Fine,\" said Harry. Harry was desperate to get out of Snape 's office and find Ron and Hermione. ",
    "\"You are to rid your mind of all emotion every night before sleep -- empty it, make it blank and calm, you understand?\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Harry, who was barely listening. ",
    "\"And be warned, Potter ... I shall know if you have not practiced ...\" ",
    "\"Right,Harry Harry mumbled. Harry picked up Harry schoolbag, swung his schoolbag over Harry shoulder, and hurried toward the office door.

Harry left without another word, closing the office door carefully behind Harry, Harry scar still throbbing painfully. ",
    "Harry found Ron and Hermione in the library, where Ron and Hermione were working on Umbridge's most recent ream of homework. Other students, nearly all of Ron and Hermione fifth years, sat at lamp-lit tables nearby, noses close to books, quills scratching feverishly, while the sky outside the mullioned windows grew steadily blacker. The only other sound was the slight squeaking of one of Madam Pince's shoes as the librarian prowled the aisles menacingly, breathing down the necks of those touching Madam Pince's precious books. ",
    "Harry felt shivery; his scar was still aching, Harry felt almost feverish. When Harry sat down opposite Ron and Hermione Harry caught sight of Harry in the window opposite. Harry was very white, and his scar seemed to be showing up more clearly than usual. ",
    "\"How did it go?\" Hermione whispered, and then, looking concerned, \"Are you all right, Harry?\" ",
    "\"Yeah ... fine ... I dunno,\" said Harry impatiently, wincing as pain shot through his scar again. \"Listen ... I've just realized something...\" ",
    "And Harry told Ron and Hermione what Harry had just seen and deduced. ",
    "\"So ... so, are you saying ...\" whispered Ron, as Madam Pince's swept past, squeaking slightly, \"that the weapon -- the thing You-Know- Who's after -- is in the Ministry of Magic?\" ",
    "\"In the Department of MysteriesMysteries, it's got to be,\" Harry whispered. \"I saw that door when your dad took me down to the courtrooms in the Ministry and that door's definitely the same one he was guarding when the snake bit he.\" ",
    "Hermione let out a long, slow sigh. \"Of course,\" Hermione breathed. ",
    "\"Of course what?\" said Ron rather impatiently. ",
    "\"Ron, think about it... Sturgis Podmore was trying to get through a door at the Ministry of MagicMagic... Sturgis Podmore must have been that one, it's too much of a coincidence!\" ",
    "\"How come Sturgis Podmore was trying to break in when Sturgis Podmore's on our side?\" said Ron. ",
    "\"Well, I don't know,\" Hermione admitted. \"That is a bit odd...\" ",
    "\"So what's in the Department of MysteriesMysteries?\" Harry asked Ron. \"Has your dad ever mentioned anything about it?\" ",
    "\"I know they call the people who work in there 'Unspeakables,' \" said Ron, frowning. \"Because no one really seems to know what they do in there... Weird place to have a weapon ...\" ",
    "\"It's not weird at all, It makes perfect sense,\" said Hermione. \"It will be something top secret that the Ministry has been developing, I expect... Harry, are you sure you're all right?\" ",
    "For Harry had just run both his hands hard over Harry forehead as though trying to iron his forehead. ",
    "\"Yeah ... fine ...\" Harry said, lowering Harry hands, which were trembling. \"I just feel a bit ... I don't like Occlumency much...\" ",
    "\"I expect anyone would feel shaky if anyone'd had anyone mind attacked over and over again,\" said Hermione sympathetically. \"Look, let's get back to the common room, well be a bit more comfortable there...\" ",
    "But the common room was packed and full of shrieks of laughter and excitement; Fred and George were demonstrating Fred and George latest bit of joke shop merchandise. ",
    "\"Headless Hats!\" shouted George, as Fred waved a pointed hat decorated with a fluffy pink feather at the watching students. \"Two Galleons each -- watch Fred, now!\" ",
    "Fred swept a pointed hat decorated with a fluffy pink feather at the watching students onto Fred head, beaming. For a second Fred merely looked rather stupid, then both hat and head vanished. ",
    "Several girls screamed, but everyone else was roaring with laughter. ",
    "\"And off again!\" shouted George, and Fred's hand groped for a moment in what seemed to be thin air over Fred shoulder; then his head reappeared as Fred swept the pink-feathered hat from the pink-feathered hat again. ",
    "\"How do those hats work, then?\" said Hermione, distracted from Hermione homework and watching Fred and GeorgeGeorge. \"I mean, obviously it's some kind of Invisibility Spell, but it's rather clever to have extended the field of invisibility beyond the boundaries of the charmed object... I'd imagine the charm wouldn't have a very long life though...\" ",
    "Harry did not answer; Harry was still feeling ill. ",
    "\"I'm going to have to do this tomorrow,\" Harry muttered, pushing the books Harry had just taken out of Harry bag back inside his bag. ",
    "\"Well, write his bag in your homework planner then!\" said Hermione encouragingly. \"So you don't forget!\" ",
    "Harry and Ron exchanged looks as Harry reached into his bag, withdrew the planner and opened the planner tentatively. ",
    "\" Don't leave the planner till later, you big second-rateri\" chided the book as Harry scribbled down Umbridge's homework. Hermione beamed at the book. ",
    "\"I think 111 go to bed,\" said Harry, stuffing the planner back into his bag and making a mental note to drop his bag in the fire the first opportunity Harry got. ",
    "Harry walked across the common room, dodging George, who tried to put a Headless Hat on Harry, and reached the peace and cool of the stone staircase to the boys' dormitories. Harry was feeling sick again, just as Harry had the night Harry had had the vision of the snake, but thought that if Harry could just lie down for a while Harry would be all right. ",
    "Harry opened the door of Harry dormitory and was one step inside the door of his dormitory when Harry experienced pain so severe Harry thought that someone must have sliced into the top of someone . Harry did not know where Harry was, whether Harry was standing or lying down, Harry did not even know Harry own name... ",
    "Maniacal laughter was ringing in Harry ears... Harry was happier than Harry had been in a very long time... Jubilant, ecstatic, triumphant ... A wonderful, wonderful thing had happened... ",
    "\"Harry? Harry!\" ",
    "Harry had hit Harry around the face. The insane laughter was punctuated with a cry of pain. The happiness was draining out of Harry, but The insane laughter continued... ",
    "Harry opened Harry eyes and as Harry did so, Harry became aware that The insane laughter was coming out of Harry own mouth. The moment Harry realized this, The moment he realized this died away; Harry lay panting on the floor, staring up at the ceiling, the scar on Harry forehead throbbing horribly. Ron was bending over Ron, looking very worried. ",
    "\"What happened?\" Ron said. ",
    "\"I ... dunno ...\" Harry gasped, sitting up again. \"Ron's really happy ... really happy ...\" ",
    "\"You-Know-Who is?\" ",
    "\"Something good's happened,\" mumbled Harry. Ron was shaking as badly as Ron had done after seeing the snake attack Mr. Weasley and felt very sick. \"Something Ron's been hoping for.\" ",
    "The words came, just as they had back in the Gryffindor changing room, as though a stranger was speaking they through Harry's mouth, yet Harry knew they were true. Harry took deep breaths, willing Harry not to vomit all over Ron. Harry was very glad that Dean and Seamus were not here to watch this time. ",
    "\"Hermione told me to come and check on you,\" said Ron in a low voice, helping Harry to Ron feet. \"\"Hermione says your defenses will be low at the moment, after Professor Snape's been fiddling around with your mind... Still, I suppose it'll help in the long run, won't it?\" ",
    "Harry looked doubtfully at Harry as Harry helped Harry toward bed. Harry nodded without any conviction and slumped back on Harry pillows, aching all over from having fallen to the floor so often that evening, Harry scar still prickling painfully. Harry could not help feeling that Harry first foray into Occlumency had weakened Harry mind's resistance rather than strengthening his mind's resistance, and  ",
    "Harry wondered, with a feeling of great trepidation, what had happened to make Lord Voldemort the happiest Lord Voldemort had been in fourteen years. "

    "For an answer Hermione's Daily Prophet spread the newspaper on the table in front of Harry and Ron together and pointed at ten black-and-white photographs that filled the whole of the front page, nine showing wizards' faces and the tenth, a witch's. Some of the people in the photographs were silently jeering; others were tapping Some of the people in the photographs fingers on the frame of Some of the people in the photographs pictures, looking insolent. Each picture was captioned with a name and the crime for which the person had been sent to Azkaban. ",

    "But Harry's eyes were drawn to the picture of the witch. Harry face had leapt out at Harry the moment Harry had seen the page. Harry had long, dark hair that looked unkempt and straggly in the picture, though Harry had seen it sleek, thick, and shining. Harry glared up at Harry through heavily lidded eyes, an arrogant, disdainful smile playing around Harry thin mouth.

Meanwhile, at the far end of the table, Professor Umbridge was tucking into a bowl of porridge. For once Professor Umbridge pouchy toad's eyes were not sweeping the Great Hall looking for misbehaving students.

    "\"Fine, fine,\" said \" ",
    "Hagrid with a feeble assumption of airiness; \" ",
    "Hagrid waved a hand and narrowly missed concussing a frightened-looking Professor Vector, who was passing. \"Jus' busy, yeh know, usual stuff -- lessons ter prepare -- couple o' salamanders got scale rot -- an' I'm on probation,\" \" ",
    "Hagrid mumbled. ",
    "\" You're on probation?\" said Ron very loudly, so that many students passing looked around curiously. \"Sorry -- I mean -- you're on probation?\" Ron whispered. ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said \" ",
    "Hagrid. \" 'S'no more'n I expected, ter tell yeh the truth. Yeh migh' not've picked up on the truth, bu' that inspection didn' go too well, yeh know ... ",
    "anyway,\" Yeh sighed deeply. \"Bes' go an mb a bit more chili powder on Bes salamanders or Bes tails'll be hangin' off 'em next. See yeh, Harry ... Ron ...\" ",
    "Yeh trudged away, out the front doors and down the stone steps into the damp grounds. Harry watched Yeh go, wondering how much more bad news Yeh could stand. ",
    "The fact that \" ",
    "Hagrid was now on probation became common knowledge within the school over the next few days, but to Harry's indignation, hardly anybody appeared to be upset about it; indeed, some people, Draco Malfoy prominent among some people, Draco Malfoy, seemed positively gleeful. As for the freakish death of an obscure Department of Mysteries employee in St. Mungo, Harry, Ron, and Hermione seemed to be the only people who knew or cared. There was only one topic of conversation in the corridors now: the ten escaped Death Eaters, whose story had finally filtered through the school from those few people who read the newspapers. Rumors were flying that some of the convicts had been spotted in Hogsmeade, that some of the convicts were supposed to be hiding out in the Shrieking Shack and that some of the convicts were going to break into Hogwarts, just as AZKABAN ",
    "MINISTRY FEARS BLACK had done. ",
    "Those who came from Wizarding families had grown up hearing the names of these Death Eaters spoken with almost as much fear as Lord Voldemort's; the crimes Those who came from Wizarding families had committed during the days of Lord Voldemort's reign of terror were legendary. There were relatives of Those who came from Wizarding families victims among the Hogwarts students, who now found themselves the unwilling objects of a gruesome sort of reflected fame as themselves walked the corridors: Susan Bones, who had an uncle, aunt, and cousins who had all died at the hands of one of the ten, said miserably during Herbology that Herbology now had a good idea what it felt like to be Harry. ",
    "\"And I don't know how you stand it, it's horrible,\" Herbology said bluntly, dumping far too much dragon manure on Herbology tray of Screechsnap seedlings, causing Screechsnap seedlings to wriggle and squeak in discomfort. ",
    "It was true that Harry was the subject of much renewed muttering and pointing in the corridors these days, yet Harry thought Harry detected a slight difference in the tone of the whisperers' voices. They sounded curious rather than hostile now, and once or twice Harry was sure Harry overheard snatches of conversation that suggested that the speakers were not satisfied with Daily Prophet's version of how and why ten Death Eaters had managed to break out of Azkaban fortress. In their confusion and fear, these doubters now seemed to be turning to the only other explanation available to their, the one that Harry and Dumbledore had been expounding since the previous year. ",
    "It was not only the students' mood that had changed. It was now quite common to come across two or three teachers conversing in low, urgent whispers in the corridors, breaking off their conversations the moment their saw students approaching. ",
    "\"their obviously can't talk freely in the staffroom anymore,\" said Hermione in a low voice, as she, ",
    "Harry, and Ron passed Professors McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout huddled together outside the Charms classroom one day. \"Not with Umbridge there.\" ",
    "\"Reckon \"Reckon know anything new?\" said Ron, gazing back over Ron shoulder at the three teachers. ",
    "\"If \"Reckon do, \"Reckon're not going to hear about it, are \"Reckon?\" said Harry angrily. \"Not after Decree ... What number are \"Reckon on now?\" ",
    "For new signs had appeared on the house notice boards the morning after news of the Azkaban breakout: ",
    "-- BY ORDER OF -- ",
    "THE HIGH INQUISITOR OF HOGWARTS ",
    "Teachers are hereby banned from giving students any information that is not strictly related to the subjects students are paid to teach. ",
    "The above is in accordance with ",
    "Educational Decree Number Twenty-six. ",
    "Signed: ",
    "Dolores Jane Umbridge HIGH INQUISITOR ",
    "This latest decree had been the subject of a great number of jokes among the students. Lee Jordan had pointed out to Umbridge that by the terms of the new rule Lee Jordan was not allowed to tell Fred and George off for playing Exploding Snap in the back of the class. ",
    "\"Exploding Snap's got nothing to do with Defense Against the Dark Arts, Professor! That's not information relating to your subject!\" ",
    "When Harry next saw Lee, the back of Harry hand was bleeding rather badly. Harry recommended essence of murtlap. ",
    "Harry had thought that the breakout from Azkaban might have humbled Umbridge a little, that she might ",
    "have been abashed at the catastrophe that had occurred right under she beloved Fudge's nose. It seemed, however, to have only intensified she furious desire to bring every aspect of life at Hogwarts under she personal control. she seemed determined at the very least to achieve a sacking before long, and the only question was whether it would be Professor Trelawney or Hagrid who went first. ",
    "Every single Divination and Care of Magical Creatures lesson was now conducted in the presence of Umbridge and she clipboard. she lurked by the fire in the heavily perfumed tower room, interrupting Professor Trelawney's increasingly hysterical talks with difficult questions about Ornithomancy and Heptomology, insisting that she predict students' answers before students' gave students' and demanding that she demonstrate she skill at the crystal ball, the tea leaves, and the rune stones in turn. Harry thought that Professor Trelawney might soon crack under the strain; several times Professor Trelawney passed she in the corridors (in itself a very unusual occurrence as she generally remained in she tower room), muttering wildly to she, wringing she hands, and shooting terrified glances over she shoulder, all the time giving off a powerful smell of cooking sherry. If Professor Trelawney had not been so worried about \" ",
    "Hagrid, Professor Trelawney would have felt sorry for she -- but if one of he had not been so worried about Hagrid was to be ousted out of a job, there could be only one choice for Harry as to who should remain. ",
    "Unfortunately, Harry could not see that \" ",
    "Hagrid was putting up a better show than Professor Trelawney. Though Professor Trelawney seemed to be following Hermione's advice and had shown Hermione's advice nothing more frightening than a crup, a creature indistinguishable from a Jack Russell terrier except for a Jack Russell terrier forked tail, since before Christmas, Professor Trelawney also seemed to have lost Professor Trelawney nerve. Professor Trelawney was oddly distracted and jumpy in lessons, losing the thread of  ",
    "what Professor Trelawney was saying while talking to the class, answering questions wrongly and glancing anxiously at Umbridge all the time. Professor Trelawney was also more distant with Harry, Ron, and Hermione than Professor Trelawney had ever been before, expressly forbidding Harry, Ron, and Hermione to visit Professor Trelawney after dark. ",
    "\"If she catches yeh, it'll be all of our necks on the line,\" Professor Trelawney told Harry, Ron, and Hermione flatly, and with no desire to do anything that jeopardized Professor Trelawney job further, Harry, Ron, and Hermione abstained from walking down to Professor Trelawney hut in the evenings. It seemed to Harry that Umbridge was steadily depriving Harry of everything that made Harry life at Hogwarts worth living: visits to \" ",
    "Hagrid's house, letters from Sirius, Harry Firebolt, and Quidditch. Harry took Harry revenge the only way Harry had: redoubling Harry efforts for the D.A. ",
    "Harry was pleased to see that all of them, even Zacharias Smith, had been spurred to work harder than ever by the news that ten more Death Eaters were now on the loose, but in nobody was this improvement more pronounced than in Neville. The news of Harry parents' attacker's escape had wrought a strange and even slightly alarming change in Harry. Harry had not once mentioned Harry meeting with Harry, Ron, and Hermione on the closed ward in St. Mungo, and taking Harry, Ron, and Hermione lead from Harry, Harry, Ron, and Hermione had kept quiet about it too. Nor had Harry said anything on the subject of Bellatrix and Bellatrix fellow torturers' escape; in fact, Harry barely spoke during D.A. meetings anymore, but worked relentlessly on every new jinx and countercurse Harry taught D.A. meetings, Harry plump face screwed up in concentration, apparently indifferent to injuries or accidents, working harder than anyone else in the room. Harry was improving so fast it was quite unnerving and when Harry taught D.A. meetings the Shield Charm, a means of deflecting minor jinxes so ",
    "that D.A. meetings rebounded upon the attacker, only Hermione mastered the charm faster than Neville. ",
    "In fact Harry would have given a great deal to be making as much progress at Occlumency as Neville was making during D.A. meetings. Harry's sessions with Snape, which had started badly enough, were not improving; on the contrary, Harry felt Harry was getting worse with every lesson. ",
    "Before Harry had started studying Occlumency, Harry scar had prickled occasionally, usually during the night, or else following one of those strange flashes of Lord Voldemort's thoughts or moods that Harry experienced every now and then. Nowadays, however, his scar hardly ever stopped prickling, and Harry often felt lurches of annoyance or cheerfulness that were unrelated to what was happening to Harry at the time, which were always accompanied by a particularly painful twinge from his scar. Harry had the horrible impression that Harry was slowly turning into a kind of aerial that was tuned in to tiny fluctuations in Lord Voldemort's mood, and Harry was sure Harry could date this increased sensitivity firmly from Harry first Occlumency lesson with Snape. What was more, Harry was now dreaming about walking down the corridor toward the entrance to the Department of Mysteries almost every night, dreams that always culminated in Harry standing longingly in front of the plain black door. ",
    "\"Maybe it's a bit like an illness,\" said only Hermione, looking concerned when Harry confided in Harry and Ron. \"A fever or something. It has to get worse before It gets better.\" ",
    "\"It's lessons with Snape that are making it worse,\" said Harry flatly. \"I'm getting sick of my scar hurting, and I'm getting bored walking down that corridor every night.\" Harry rubbed Harry forehead angrily. \"I just ",
    "wish the door would open, I'm sick of standing staring at the door -- \" ",
    "\"That's not funny,\" said only Hermione sharply. \"Dumbledore doesn't want you to have dreams about that corridor at all, or Dumbledore wouldn't have asked Snape to teach Occlumency. You're just going to have to work a bit harder in your lessons.\" ",
    "\"I am working!\" said Harry, nettled. \"You try it sometime, Snape trying to get inside your head, it's not a bundle of laughs, you know!\" ",
    "\"Maybe ...\" said Ron slowly. ",
    "\"Maybe what?\" said only Hermione rather snappishly. ",
    "\"Maybe it's not Harry's fault Harry can't close Harry mind,\" said Ron darkly. ",
    "\"What do you mean?\" said only Hermione. ",
    "\"Well, maybe Snape isn't really trying to help Harry...\" ",
    "Harry and only Hermione stared at Snape. Ron looked darkly and meaningfully from one to the other. ",
    "\"Maybe,\" Ron said again in a lower voice, \"Ron's actually trying to open Harry's mind a bit wider . . . make it easier for You-Know -- \" ",
    "\"Shut up, Ron,\" said only Hermione angrily. \"How many times have you suspected Snape, and when have you ever been right? Dumbledore trusts Snape, Dumbledore works for the Order, that ought to be enough.\" ",
    "\"Dumbledore used to be a Death Eater,\" said Ron stubbornly. \"And we've never seen proof that Ron really swapped sides...Dumbledore trusts him,\" only Hermione repeated. \"And if we can't trust Dumbledore, we can't trust anyone.\" ",
    "With so much to worry about and so much to do -- startling amounts of homework that frequently kept the fifth years working until past midnight, secret D.A. meetings, and regular classes with Snape -- January seemed to be passing alarmingly fast. Before Harry knew it, February had arrived, bringing with it wetter and warmer weather and the prospect of the second Hogsmeade visit of the year. Harry had had very little time to spare on conversations with Cho since conversations with Cho had agreed to visit the village together, but suddenly found Cho facing a Valentine's Day spent entirely in Cho company. ",
    "On the morning of the fourteenth Cho dressed particularly carefully. Cho and Ron arrived at breakfast just in time for the arrival of the post owls. Hedwig was not there -- not that Cho had expected Hedwig -- but only Hermione was tugging a letter from the beak of an unfamiliar brown owl as He and Ron sat down. ",
    "\"And about time! If it hadn't come today ...\" Cho said eagerly, tearing open the envelope and pulling out a small piece of parchment. Cho eyes sped from left to right as Cho read through the message and a grimly pleased expression spread across Cho face. ",
    "\"Listen, Harry,\" Cho said, looking up at Harry. \"This is really important... Do you think you could meet me in the Three Broomsticks around midday?\" ",
    "\"Well ... I dunno,\" said Harry dubiously. \"Cho might be expecting me to spend the whole day with Cho. We never said what We were going to do.\" ",
    "\"Well, bring Cho along if you must,\" said only Hermione urgently. \"But will you come?\" ",
    "\"Well ... all right, but why?\" ",
    "\"I haven't got time to tell you now, I've got to answer this quickly -- \" ",
    "And Cho hurried out of the Great Hall, the letter clutched in one hand and a piece of uneaten toast in the other. ",
    "\"Are you coming?\" Harry asked Ron, but Harry shook Ron head, looking glum. ",
    "\"I can't come into Hogsmeade at all, Cho wants a full day's training. Like it's going to help -- We're the worst team I've ever seen. You should see Sloper and Kirke, Sloper and Kirke're pathetic, even worse than I am.\" Harry heaved a great sigh. \"I dunno why Cho won't just let me resign...\" ",
    "\"It's because you're good when you're on form, that's why,\" said Harry irritably. ",
    "Harry found it very hard to be sympathetic to Ron's plight when Harry himself would have given almost anything to be playing in the forthcoming match against Hufflepuff. Ron seemed to notice Harry's tone, because Ron did not mention Quidditch again during breakfast, and there was a slight frostiness in the way they said good-bye to each other shortly afterward. Ron departed for the Quidditch pitch and Harry, after attempting to flatten Ron hair while staring at Ron reflection in the back of a teaspoon, proceeded alone to the Great Hall to meet Cho, feeling very apprehensive and wondering what on earth they were going to talk about. ",
    "Cho was waiting for Ron a little to the side of the oak front doors, looking very pretty with his hair. Harry's feet seemed to be too ",
    "big for Harry body as Harry walked toward Cho, and Harry was suddenly horribly aware of Harry arms and how stupid they looked swinging at Harry sides. ",
    "\"Hi,\" said Cho slightly breathlessly. ",
    "\"Hi,\" said Harry. ",
    "they stared at each other for a moment, then Harry said, \"Well -- er -- shall they go, then?\" ",
    "\"Oh -- yes ...\" ",
    "they joined the queue of people being signed out by Filch, occasionally catching each other's eye and grinning shiftily, but not talking to each other. Harry was relieved when they reached the fresh air, finding it easier to walk along in silence than just stand there looking awkward. It was a fresh, breezy sort of day and as they passed the Quidditch stadium, Harry glimpsed Ron and Ginny skimming over the stands and felt a horrible pang that Harry was not up there with they... ",
    "\"You really miss it, don't you?\" said Cho. ",
    "Harry looked around and saw Cho watching Harry. ",
    "\"Yeah,\" sighed Harry. \"I do.\" ",
    "\"Remember the first time we played against each other, in the third year?\" Cho asked Harry. ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Harry, grinning. \"You kept blocking me.\" ",
    "\"And Wood told you not to be a gentleman and knock me off my broom if you had to,\" said Cho, smiling reminiscently. \"I heard Harry got taken on by Pride of Portree, is that right?\" ",
    "\"Nah, it was Puddlemere United, I saw Harry at the World Cup last year.\" ",
    "\"Oh, I saw you there too, remember? we were on the same campsite. It was really good, wasn't It?\" ",
    "The subject of the Quidditch World Cup carried them all the way down the drive and out through the gates. Harry could hardly believe how easy it was to talk to Harry, no more difficult, in fact, than talking to Ron and Hermione, and Harry was just starting to feel confident and cheerful when a large gang of Slytherin girls passed a large gang of Slytherin girls, including Pansy Parkinson. ",
    "\"Potter and Chang!\" screeched Pansy to a chorus of snide giggles. \"Urgh, Chang, I don't think much of your taste... At least Diggory was good-looking!\" ",
    "They sped up, talking and shrieking in a pointed fashion with many exaggerated glances back at Harry and Cho, leaving an embarrassed silence in They wake. Harry could think of nothing else to say about Quidditch, and Cho, slightly flushed, was watching Cho feet. ",
    "\"So ... where d'you want to go?\" Harry asked as they entered Hogsmeade. The High Street was full of students ambling up and down, peering into the shop windows and messing about together on the pavements. ",
    "\"Oh ... I don't mind,\" said Cho, shrugging. \"Um ... shall we just have a look in the shops or something?\" ",
    "they wandered toward Dervish and Banges. A large poster had been stuck up in the window and a few Hogsmeaders were looking at A large poster. they moved aside when \" ",
    "Harry and Hermione Cho approached and Harry found Harry staring once more at the ten pictures of the  ",
    "escaped Death Eaters. A large poster offered a thousand-Galleon reward to any witch or wizard with information relating to the recapture of any of the convicts pictured. ",
    "\"It's funny, isn't it,\" said Cho in a low voice, also gazing up at the pictures of the Death Eaters. \"Remember when that Sirius Black escaped, and there were dementors all over Hogsmeade looking for him? And now ten Death Eaters are on the loose and there aren't dementors anywhere...\" ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Harry, tearing Harry eyes away from Bellatrix Lestrange's face to glance up and down The High Street. \"Yeah, it is weird...\" ",
    "Harry was not sorry that there were no dementors nearby, but now Harry came to think of no dementors, there were no dementors nearby absence was highly significant. there were no dementors nearby had not only let the Death Eaters Death Eaters escape, there were no dementors nearby were not bothering to look for there were no dementors nearby... It looked as though there were no dementors nearby really were outside Ministry control now. ",
    "ten Death Eaters Death Eaters were staring out of every shop window Death Eaters Cho passed. ten Death Eaters started to rain as ten Death Eaters passed Scrivenshaft's; cold, heavy drops of water kept hitting Harry's face and the back of Harry neck. ",
    "\"Um ... d'you want to get a coffee?\" said Cho tentatively, as the rain began to fall more heavily. ",
    "\"Yeah, all right,\" said Harry, looking around. \"Where -- ?\" ",
    "\"Oh, there's a really nice place just up here, haven't you ever been to Madam Puddifoot's?\" Cho said brightly, and Cho led Harry up a side road and into a small tea shop that Harry had never noticed before. It ",
    "was a cramped, steamy little place where everything seemed to have been decorated with frills or bows. Harry was reminded unpleasantly of Umbridge's office. ",
    "\"Cute, isn't it?\" said Cho happily. ",
    "\"Er ... yeah,\" said Harry untruthfully. ",
    "\"Look, Cho's decorated it for Valentine's Day!\" said Cho, indicating a number of golden cherubs that were hovering over each of the small, circular tables, occasionally throwing pink confetti over the occupants. ",
    "\"Aaah ...\" ",
    "They sat down at the last remaining table, which was situated in the steamy window. Roger Davies, the Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain, was sitting about a foot and a half away with a pretty blonde girl. They were holding hands. The sight made Harry feel uncomfortable, particularly when, looking around the tea shop, Harry saw that it was full of nothing but couples, all of couples holding hands. Perhaps Cho would expect Cho to hold Cho hand. ",
    "\"What can I get you, m'dears?\" said Madam Puddifoot, a very stout woman with a shiny black bun, squeezing between Madam Puddifoot, a very stout woman with a shiny black bun table and Roger Davies's with great difficulty. ",
    "\"Two coffees, please,\" said Cho. ",
    "In the time it took for their coffees to arrive, Roger Davies's and Roger Davies's girlfriend started kissing over Roger Davies and his girlfriend sugar bowl. Harry wished Roger Davies and his girlfriend wouldn't; Harry felt that Roger Davies's was setting a standard with which Cho would soon expect Harry to compete. Harry felt Harry face growing  ",
    "hot and tried staring out of the window, but it was so steamed up Harry could not see the street outside. To postpone the moment when Harry had to look at Cho Harry stared up at the ceiling as though examining the paintwork and received a handful of confetti in his face from their hovering cherub. ",
    "After a few more painful minutes Cho mentioned Umbridge; Harry seized on the subject with relief and they passed a few happy moments abusing Cho, but the subject with relief had already been so thoroughly canvassed during D.A. meetings the subject with relief did not last very long. Silence fell again. Harry was very conscious of the slurping noises coming from the table next door and cast wildly around for something else to say. ",
    "\"Er ... listen, d'you want to come with me to the Three Broomsticks at lunchtime? I'm meeting Hermione Granger there.\" ",
    "Cho raised Cho eyebrows. ",
    "\"You're meeting Hermione Granger? Today?\" ",
    "\"Yeah. Well, Cho asked me to, so I thought I would. D'you want to come with me? Cho said it wouldn't matter if you did.\" ",
    "\"Oh ... well ... that was nice of Cho.\" ",
    "But Cho did not sound as though Cho thought it was nice at all; on the contrary, Cho tone was cold and all of a sudden Cho looked rather forbidding. ",
    "A few more minutes passed in total silence, Harry drinking Harry coffee so fast that Harry would soon need a fresh cup. next door, Roger Davies and his girlfriend his girlfriend seemed glued together by the lips. ",
    "Cho's hand was lying on the table beside his coffee, and Harry was feeling a mounting pressure to take hold of Cho's hand. Just do Cho's hand, Harry told Harry, as a fount of mingled panic and excitement surged up inside Harry chest. Just reach out and grab it... Amazing how much more difficult it was to extend Harry arm twelve inches and touch Cho's hand than to snatch a speeding Snitch from midair ... ",
    "But just as Harry moved Cho's hand forward, Cho took Cho off the table. Cho was now watching Roger Davies's kissing his girlfriend with a mildly interested expression. ",
    "\"Cho asked me out, you know,\" Cho said in a quiet voice. \"A couple of weeks ago. Roger Davies's. I turned Roger Davies's down, though.\" ",
    "Harry, who had grabbed the sugar bowl to excuse Roger Davies's sudden lunging movement across the table, could not think why Cho was telling Roger Davies's this. If Cho wished Cho were sitting at the table next door being heartily kissed by Roger Davies's, why had Cho agreed to come out with Roger Davies's? ",
    "Roger Davies's said nothing. Their cherub threw another handful of confetti over Their; some of Their cherub landed in the last cold dregs of Harry Harry had been about to drink. ",
    "\"I came in here with Cedric last year,\" said Cho. ",
    "In the second or so it took for Cedric to take in what Cho had said, Harry's insides had become glacial. Harry could not believe Cho wanted to talk about Cedric now, while kissing couples surrounded kissing couples and a cherub floated over kissing couples heads. ",
    "Cho's voice was rather higher when Cho spoke again. ",
    "\"I've been meaning to ask you for ages... Did Cedric did Cedric m-m-mention me at all before Cedric died?\" ",
    "This was the very last subject on earth Harry wanted to discuss, and least of all with Cho. ",
    "\"Well -- no -- \" Harry said quietly. \"There -- there wasn't time for Harry to say anything. Erm ... so ... d'you ... d'you get to see a lot of Quidditch in the holidays? ",
    "You support the Tornados, right?\" ",
    "Cho's voice sounded falsely bright and cheery. To Harry horror, Harry saw that Cho eyes were swimming with tears again, just as they had been after the last D.A. meeting before Christmas. ",
    "\"Look,\" Harry said desperately, leaning in so that nobody else could overhear, \"let's not talk about Cedric right now... Let's talk about something else...\" ",
    "But this, apparently, was quite the wrong thing to say. ",
    "\"I thought,\" Cho said, tears spattering down onto the table. \"I thought you'd u-u-understand! I need to talk about it! Surely you n-need to talk about it t-too! I mean, you saw it happen, d-didn't you?\" ",
    "Everything was going nightmarishly wrong; Roger Davies's girlfriend had even unglued Roger Davies' girlfriend to look around at Cho crying. ",
    "\"Well -- I have talked about it,Harry Harry said in a whisper, \"to Ron and Hermione, but -- \" ",
    "\"Oh, you'll talk to Hermione Granger!\" Roger Davies' girlfriend said shrilly, Roger Davies' girlfriend face now shining with tears, and several more kissing couples broke apart to stare. \"But you won't talk to Harry! P-perhaps it would be best if we just ",
    "... just p-paid and you went and met up with Hermione G-Granger, like you obviously want to!\" ",
    "Harry stared at Roger Davies' girlfriend, utterly bewildered, as Roger Davies' girlfriend seized a frilly napkin and dabbed at Roger Davies' girlfriend shining face with it. ",
    "\"Cho?\" he said weakly, wishing Roger Davies's would seize he and start kissing Roger Davies' girlfriend again to stop Roger Davies' girlfriend goggling at he and Cho. ",
    "\"Go on, leave!\" Roger Davies' girlfriend said, now crying into the napkin. ",
    "\"I don't know why you asked me out in the first place if you're going to make arrangements to meet other girls right after me... How many are you meeting after Hermione?\" ",
    "\"It's not like that!\" said Harry, and Harry was so relieved at finally understanding what Roger Davies' girlfriend was annoyed about that Harry laughed, which Harry realized a split second too late was a mistake. ",
    "Cho sprang to Cho feet. The whole tearoom was quiet, and everybody was watching them now. ",
    "\"I'll see you around, Harry,\" Cho said dramatically, and hiccuping slightly Cho dashed to the door, wrenched the door open, and hurried off into the pouring rain. ",
    "\"Cho!\" Harry called after Cho, but the door had already swung shut behind Cho with a tuneful tinkle. ",
    "There was total silence within the tea shop. Every eye was upon Harry. Harry threw a Galleon down onto the table, shook pink confetti out of his eyes, and followed Cho out of the door. ",
    "It was raining hard now, and Cho was nowhere to be seen. Harry simply did not understand what had ",
    "happened; half an hour ago they had been getting along fine. ",
    "\"Women!\" Harry muttered angrily, sloshing down the rain-washed street with Harry hands in Harry pockets. \"What did Cho want to talk about Cedric for anyway? Why does Cho always want to drag up a subject that makes Cho act like a human hosepipe?\" ",
    "Harry turned right and broke into a splashy run, and within minutes Harry was turning into the doorway of the Three Broomsticks. Harry knew Harry was too early to meet Hermione, but Harry thought it likely there would be someone in here with whom Harry could spend the intervening time. Harry shook Harry wet hair out of his eyes and looked around. Hagrid was sitting alone in a corner, looking morose. ",
    "\"Hi, Hagrid!\" Harry said, when Harry had squeezed through the crammed tables and pulled up a chair beside Harry. ",
    "Hagrid jumped and looked down at Harry as though Harry barely recognized Harry. Harry saw that Harry had two fresh cuts on Harry face and several new bruises. ",
    "\"Oh, it's you, Harry,\" said Hagrid. \"You all righ'?\" ",
    "\"Yeah, I'm fine,\" lied Harry; in fact, next to this battered and mournful-looking Hagrid, Harry felt Harry did not have much to complain about. \"Er -- are you okay?\" ",
    "\"Me?\" said Hagrid. \"Oh yeah, I'm grand, Harry, grand...\" ",
    "Harry gazed into the depths of Harry pewter tankard, which was the size of a large bucket, and sighed. Harry did not know what to say to Harry. They sat side by side in ",
    "silence for a moment. Then Hagrid said abruptly, \"In the same boat, you an' me, aren' we, Harry?\" ",
    "\"Er -- \" said Harry. ",
    "\"Yeah ... I've said it before... Both outsiders, like,\" said Hagrid, nodding wisely. \"An' both orphans. Yeah ... both orphans.\" ",
    "He took a great swig from He tankard. ",
    "\"Makes a diff'rence, havin' a decent family,\" He said. \"Me dad was decent. An' your mum an' dad were decent. If they'd lived, life woulda bin diff'rent, eh?\" ",
    "\"Yeah ... I s'pose,\" said Harry cautiously. Hagrid seemed to be in a very strange mood. ",
    "\"Family,\" said Hagrid gloomily. \"Whatever yeh say, blood's important...\" ",
    "And yeh wiped a trickle of it out of yeh eye. ",
    "\"Hagrid,\" said Harry, unable to stop yeh, \"where are you getting all these injuries?\" ",
    "\"Eh?\" said Hagrid, looking startled. \"Wha' injuries?\" ",
    "\"All those!\" said Harry, pointing at Hagrid 's face. ",
    "\"Oh ... tha's jus' normal bumps an' bruises, Harry,\" said Hagrid dismissively. \"I got a rough job.\" ",
    "yeh drained yeh , set his tankard back upon the table, and got to yeh feet. ",
    "\"I'll be seein'yeh, Harry... Take care now...\" ",
    "And Harry lumbered out of the pub looking wretched and then disappeared into the torrential rain. Harry watched Harry go, feeling miserable. Hagrid was unhappy and Harry was hiding something, but Harry seemed determined not to accept help. What was going on? But before Harry could think about the matter any further, Harry heard a voice calling Harry name. ",
    "\"Harry! Harry, over here!\" ",
    "Hermione was waving at Harry from the other side of the room. Harry got up and made Harry way toward Hermione through the pub. Harry was still a few tables away when Harry realized that Hermione was not alone; Hermione was sitting at a table with the unlikeliest pair of drinking mates Harry could ever have imagined: Luna Lovegood and none other than Rita Skeeter, ex- journalist on the Daily Prophet and one of Hermione's least favorite people in the world.

    "\"You're early!\" said Hermione, moving along to give Harry room to sit down. \"I thought you were with Cho, I wasn't expecting you for another hour at least!\" ",

    "\"What are you up to?\" Harry asked, sitting down and staring from Rita to Luna to Hermione. ",
    "\"Little Miss Perfect was just about to tell me when you arrived,\" said Rita, taking a large slurp of Rita drink. \"I suppose I'm allowed to talk to a large slurp of her drink, am I?\" Rita shot at Hermione. ",
    "\"Yes, I suppose you are,\" said Hermione coldly. ",
    "Unemployment did not suit Rita. The hair that had once been set in elaborate curls now hung lank and unkempt around Rita face. The scarlet paint on Rita two-inch talons was chipped and there were a couple of false jewels missing from Rita winged glasses.

    "\"One more word about Harry's love life and the deal's off and that's a promise,\" said Hermione irritably. ",
    "\"What deal?\" said Rita, wiping her mouth on the back of Rita hand. \"You haven't mentioned a deal yet, Miss Prissy, you just told me to turn up. Oh, one of these days ...\" Rita took a deep shuddering breath. ",
    "\"Yes, yes, one of these days you'll write more horrible stories about Harry and me,\" said Hermione indifferently. \"Find someone who cares, why don't you?\" ",
    "\"They've run plenty of horrible stories about Harry this year without my help,\" said Rita, shooting a sideways look at Harry over the top of Rita glass and adding in a rough whisper, \"How has that made you feel, Harry? Betrayed? Distraught? Misunderstood?\" ",
    "\"Harry feels angry, of course,\" said Hermione in a hard, clear voice. \"Because Harry's told the Minister of Magic ",
    "the truth and the Minister's too much of an idiot to believe Harry.\" ",
    "\"So you actually stick to it, do you, that He-Who- Must-Not-Be-Named is back?\" said Rita, lowering Must-Not-Be-Named and subjecting Harry to a piercing stare while Must-Not-Be-Named finger strayed longingly to the clasp of the crocodile bag. \"You stand by all this garbage Dumbledore's been telling everybody about You- Know-Who returning and you being the sole witness -- ?\" ",
    "\"I wasn't the sole witness,\" snarled Harry. \"There were a dozen-odd Death Eaters there as well. Want a dozen-odd Death Eaters there names?\" ",
    "\"I'd love a dozen-odd Death Eaters there,\" breathed Rita, now fumbling in the crocodile bag once more and gazing at Dumbledore as though Dumbledore was the most beautiful thing Rita had ever seen. \"A great bold headline: 'Potter Accuses ...'A subheading: ",

    "businesslike tone, \"All right, Fudge is leaning on \"The Prophet, but it comes to the same thing. They won't print a story that shows Harry in a good light. Nobody wants to read it.

    "\"So the Daily Prophet exists to tell people what people want to hear, does the Daily Prophet?\" said Hermione scathingly. ",

    "\"\"The Prophet exists to sell \"The Prophet, you silly girl,\" Rita said coldly. ",

Harry guessed that that story would confirm a lot of people in the view that Harry was completely insane, not least because that story would be appearing alongside utter rubbish about Crumple-Horned Snorkacks.

    "\"Hermione,\" said Harry, shaking his head, \"you're good on feelings and stuff, but you just don't understand about Quidditch.\" ",
    "\"Maybe not,\" Hermione said darkly, returning to Hermione translation again, \"but at least my happiness doesn't depend on Ron's goalkeeping ability.\" ",

    "The very best thing you could say about the match was that it was short; the Gryffindor spectators had to endure only twenty-two minutes of agony. It was hard to say what the worst thing was: Harry thought it was a close-run contest between Ron's fourteenth failed save, Sloper missing the Bludger but hitting Angelina in the mouth with Sloper bat, and Kirke shrieking and falling backward off Kirke broom as Zacharias Smith zoomed at Kirke carrying the Quaffle. The miracle was that Gryffindor only lost by ten points: Ginny managed to snatch the Snitch from right under Hufflepuff Seeker Summerby's nose, so that the final score was two hundred and forty versus two hundred and thirty.

    "\"Good catch,\"Harry told Ginny back in the common room, where the atmosphere closely resembled that of a particularly dismal funeral. ",

    "\"Ginny, I've got a lifelong ban.\" ",
    "\"You're banned as long as Umbridge is in the school,Ginny Ginny corrected the Snitch. \"There's a difference. Anyway, once you're back, I think I'll try out for Chaser. Angelina and Alicia are both leaving next year and I prefer goal-scoring to Seeking anyway.\" ",

    "Harry liked Angelina for the faith Angelina was showing in Ron, but at the same time thought it would really be kinder to let Harry leave the team.

    "Harry got into bed, thinking about the match. It had been immensely frustrating watching from the sidelines. Harry was quite impressed by Ginny's performance but Harry felt that if Harry had been playing Harry could have caught the Snitch sooner...

    "Umbridge had been sitting a few rows below Harry and Hermione. Once or twice Ginny had turned squatly in Ginny seat to look at Umbridge, Ginny wide toad's mouth stretched in what Umbridge thought had been a gloating smile. The memory of it made Umbridge feel hot with anger as Umbridge lay there in the dark. After a few minutes, however, Umbridge remembered that Umbridge was supposed to be emptying Umbridge mind of all emotion before Umbridge slept, as Snape kept instructing Umbridge at the end of every Occlumency lesson.

    "Umbridge tried for a moment or two, but the thought of Snape on top of memories of Umbridge merely increased Umbridge sense of grumbling resentment, and Umbridge found Umbridge focusing instead on how much Umbridge loathed the pair of them.

    "For some reason Umbridge glanced up at the staff table as Umbridge said this. Umbridge had the strangest feeling that Dumbledore had been watching Dumbledore a second before, but when Umbridge looked, Dumbledore seemed to be absorbed in conversation with Professor Flitwick. ",
    "\"An interview?\" repeated Umbridge, her voice thinner and higher than ever. \"What do you mean?\" ",
    "\"I mean a reporter asked me questions and I answered questions,\" said Harry. \"Here -- \" ",
    "And a reporter threw the copy of The Quibbler at her. her caught the copy of The Quibbler and stared down at the cover. her pale, doughy face turned an ugly, patchy violet. ",
    "\"When did you do this?\" her asked, her voice trembling slightly. ",
    "\"Last Hogsmeade weekend,\" said Harry. ",
    "her looked up at Harry, incandescent with rage, the magazine shaking in her stubby fingers. ",
    "\"There will be no more Hogsmeade trips for you, Mr. Potter,\" her whispered. \"How you dare ... how you could ...\" her took a deep breath. \"I have tried again and again to teach you not to tell lies. The message, apparently, has still not sunk in. Fifty points from Gryffindor and another week's worth of detentions.\" ",
    "her stalked away, clutching The Quibbler to her chest, the eyes of many students following her. ",
    "By mid-morning enormous signs had been put up all over the school, not just on House notice boards, but in the corridors and classrooms too. ",
    "-- BY ORDER OF -- ",
    "THE HIGH INQUISITOR OF HOGWARTS ",
    "Any student found in possession of the magazine The Quibbler will be expelled. ",
    "The above is in accordance with ",
    "Educational Decree Number Twenty-seven. ",
    "Signed: ",
    "Dolores Jane Umbridge HIGH INQUISITOR ",
    "For some reason, every time Hermione caught sight of one of these signs Hermione beamed with pleasure. ",
    "\"What exactly are you so happy about?\" Harry asked Hermione. ",
    "\"HarryHarry, don't you see?\" Hermione breathed. \"If Hermione could have done one thing to make absolutely sure that every single person in the school will read your interview, the school was banning the school!\" ",
    "And the school seemed that Hermione was quite right. By the end of that day, though Harry had not seen so much as a corner of The Quibbler anywhere in the school, the whole place seemed to be quoting your interview at each other; Harry heard each other whispering about it as each other queued up outside classes, discussing it over lunch and in the back of lessons, while Hermione even reported that every occupant of the cubicles in the girls' toilets had been talking about it when Hermione nipped in there before Ancient Runes. ",
    "\"And then they spotted me, and obviously they know I know you, so they were bombarding me with questions,Hermione told Harry, Hermione eyes shining, \"and Harry, I think they believe you, I really do, I think you've finally got they convinced!\" ",
    "Umbridge was stalking the school, stopping students at random and demanding that they turn out they books and pockets. Harry knew Harry was looking for copies of The Quibbler, but the students were several steps ahead of Harry. The pages carrying Harry's interview had been bewitched to resemble extracts from textbooks if anyone but themselves read it, or else wiped magically blank until themselves wanted to peruse it again. Soon it seemed that every single person in the school had read it. ",
    "The teachers were, of course, forbidden from mentioning the interview by Educational Decree Number Twenty-six, but The teachers found ways to express The teachers feelings about it all the same. Professor Sprout awarded Gryffindor twenty points when Harry passed Harry a watering can; a beaming Professor Flitwick  ",
    "pressed a box of squeaking sugar mice on Harry at the end of Charms, said \"Shh\\\" and hurried away; and Umbridge broke into hysterical sobs during Divination and announced to the startled class, and a very disapproving Umbridge, that Harry was not going to suffer an early death after all, but would live to a ripe old age, become Minister of Magic, and have twelve children. ",
    "But what made Harry happiest was Cho catching up with Harry as Cho was hurrying along to Transfiguration the next day. Before Cho knew what had happened Cho hand was in Cho and Cho was breathing in Cho ear, ",
    "\"I'm really, really sorry. That interview was so brave ...it made me cry.\" ",
    "Cho was sorry to hear Cho had shed even more tears over it, but very glad they were on speaking terms again, and even more pleased when Cho gave Cho a swift kiss on the cheek and hurried off again. And unbelievably, no sooner had Cho arrived outside Transfiguration than something just as good happened: Seamus stepped out of the queue to face Seamus. ",
    "\"I just wanted to say,\" Seamus mumbled, squinting at Harry's left knee, \"I believe you. And I've sent a copy of that magazine to Seamus mam.\" ",
    "If anything more was needed to complete Harry's happiness, it was Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's reactions. Cho saw them with them heads together later that afternoon in the library, together with a weedy-looking boy Hermione whispered was called Theodore Nott. them looked around at Harry as Cho browsed the shelves for the book Cho needed on Partial Vanishment, and Goyle cracked Cho knuckles threateningly and Malfoy whispered something undoubtedly malevolent to Crabbe. Harry knew  ",
    "perfectly well why them were acting like this: Harry had named all of them fathers as Death Eaters. ",
    "\"And the best bit is,\" whispered Hermione gleefully as them left the library, \"them can't contradict you, because them can't admit them've read the article!\" ",
    "To cap it all, Luna told Harry over dinner that no copy of The Quibbler had ever sold out faster. ",
    "\"Dad's reprinting!\" Luna told Harry, Luna eyes popping excitedly. \"Harry can't believe it, Harry says people seem even more interested in this than the Crumple- Horned Snorkacks!\" ",
    "Harry was a hero in the Gryffindor common room that night; daringly, Fred and George had put an Enlargement Charm on the front cover of The Quibbler and hung the front cover of The Quibbler on the wall, so that Harry's giant head gazed down upon the proceedings, occasionally saying things like \"The Ministry are morons\" and \"Eat dung, Umbridge\" in a booming voice. Hermione did not find this very amusing; Hermione said the front cover of The Quibbler interfered with Hermione concentration, and ended up going to bed early out of irritation. Harry had to admit that the poster was not quite as funny after an hour or two, especially when the talking spell had started to wear off, so that the poster merely shouted disconnected words like \"Dung\" and \"Umbridge\" at more and more frequent intervals in a progressively higher voice. In fact it started to make Harry head ache and Harry scar began prickling uncomfortably again. To disappointed moans from the many people who were sitting around Harry, asking Harry to relive Harry interview for the umpteenth time, Harry announced that Harry too needed an early night. ",
    "The dormitory was empty when Harry reached The dormitory. Harry rested Harry forehead for a moment against the cool ",
    "glass of the window beside Harry bed; the cool ",
    "glass of the window felt soothing against his scar. Then Harry undressed and got into bed, wishing Harry headache would go away. Harry also felt slightly sick. Harry rolled over onto Harry side, closed Harry eyes, and fell asleep almost at once... ",
    "Harry was standing in a dark, curtained room lit by a single branch of candles. Harry hands were clenched on the back of a chair in front of Harry. They were long- fingered and white as though They had not seen sunlight for years and looked like large, pale spiders against the dark velvet of a chair. ",
    "Beyond a chair, in a pool of light cast upon the floor by the candles, knelt a man in black robes. ",
    "\"I have been badly advised, it seems,\" said Harry, in a high, cold voice that pulsed with anger. ",
    "\"Master, I crave your pardon...\" croaked the man kneeling on the floor. The back of his head glimmered in the candlelight. Harry seemed to be trembling. ",
    "\"I do not blame you, Rookwood,\" said Harry in that cold, cruel voice. ",
    "Harry relinquished Harry grip upon a chair and walked around a chair, closer to a man in black robes, until Harry stood directly over Harry in the darkness, looking down from a far greater height than usual. ",
    "\"You are sure of your facts, Rookwood?\" asked Harry. ",
    "\"Yes, My Lord, yes ... I used to work in the department after -- after all...\" ",
    "\"Avery told me Bode would be able to remove the department.\" ",
    "\"Bode could never have taken the department, \"Master. . . Bode would have known Bode could not... Undoubtedly that is why Bode fought so hard against Malfoy's Imperius Curse...\" ",
    "\"Stand up, Rookwood,\" whispered Harry. ",
    "a man in black robes almost fell over in a man in black robes haste to obey. a man in black robes face was pockmarked; the scars were thrown into relief by the candlelight. a man in black robes remained a little stooped when standing, as though halfway through a bow, and a man in black robes darted terrified looks up at His face. ",
    "\"You have done well to tell me this,\" said Harry. \"Very well ... I have wasted months on fruitless schemes, it seems... But no matter ... We begin again, from now. You have Lord Voldemort's gratitude, Rookwood...\" ",
    "\"My Lord ... yes, My Lord,\" gasped Rookwood, My Lord voice hoarse with relief. ",
    "\"I shall need your help. I shall need all the information you can give me.\" ",
    "\"Of course, My Lord, of course ... anything ...\" ",
    "\"Very well ... you may go. Send Avery to me.\" ",
    "Rookwood scurried backward, bowing, and disappeared through a door. ",
    "Left alone in the dark room, Harry turned toward the wall. A cracked, age-spotted mirror hung on the wall. Harry moved toward it. Harry reflection grew larger and clearer in the darkness... A face whiter than a skull . . . red eyes with slits for pupils . . . ",
    "\"NOOOOOOOOO!\" ",
    "\"What?\" yelled a voice nearby. ",
    "Harry flailed around madly, became entangled in the hangings, and fell out of his bed. For a few seconds Harry did not know where Harry was; Harry was convinced that Harry was about to see the white, skull-like face looming at Harry out of the dark again, then Harry's voice spoke very near to Harry.

    "\"Will you stop acting like a maniac, and I can get you out of here!\" ",
    "Harry wrenched the hangings apart, and Harry stared up at \" ",
    "Ron in the moonlight, as \" ",
    "Ron lay flat on \" ",

    "Ron scar searing with pain. \" ",
    "Ron looked as though \" ",
    "Ron had just been getting ready for bed; one arm was out of \" ",
    "Ron robes. ",
    "\"Has someone been attacked again?\" asked \" ",
    "Ron, pulling Harry roughly to \" ",
    "Ron feet. \"Is it Dad? Is it that snake?\" ",
    "\"No -- everyone's fine -- \" gasped Harry, whose forehead felt as though it was on fire again. \"Well ... Avery isn't... Avery's in trouble... Avery gave Avery the wrong information... Avery's really angry...\" ",
    "Harry groaned and sank, shaking, onto Avery , rubbing Avery . ",
    "\"But \" ",
    "Rookwood's going to help Avery now... Avery's on the right track again...\" ",
    "\"What are you talking about?\" said \" ",
    "Ron, sounding scared. \"D'you mean ... did you just see You-Know- Who?\" ",
    "\"I was You-Know-Who,\" said Harry, and Avery stretched out Avery hands in the darkness and held them up to ",
    "Avery face to check that them were no longer deathly white and long-fingered. \"Avery was with \" ",
    "Rookwood, Avery's one of the Death Eaters who escaped from Azkaban, remember? \" ",
    "Rookwood's just told Avery Bode couldn't have done it...\" ",
    "\"Done what?\" ",
    "\"Remove something. . . Avery said Bode would have known Avery couldn't have done it... Bode was under the Imperius Curse... I think Avery said Malfoy's dad put it on Avery...\" ",
    "Bode was bewitched to remove something?\" \" ",
    "Ron said. \"But -- Harry, that's got to be -- \" ",
    "\"The weapon,\" Harry finished the sentence for Harry. \"I know.\" ",
    "The dormitory door opened; Dean and Seamus came in. Harry swung Harry legs back into bed. Harry did not want to look as though anything odd had just happened, seeing as Seamus had only just stopped thinking Harry was a nutter. ",
    "\"Did you say,\" murmured \" ",
    "Ron, putting \" ",
    "Ron close to Harry's on the pretense of helping \" ",
    "Ron to water from the jug on \" ",
    "Ron bedside table, \"that you were You- Know-Who?\" ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Harry quietly. ",
    "\" ",
    "Ron took an unnecessarily large gulp of water. Harry saw it spill over Harry chin onto Harry chest. ",
    "\"Harry,\" Harry said, as Dean and Seamus clattered around noisily, pulling off Dean and Seamus robes, and talking, \"you've got to tell -- \" ",
    "\"I haven't got to tell anyone,\" said Harry shortly. \"I wouldn't have seen it at all if I could do Occlumency. I'm supposed to have learned to shut this stuff out. That's what they want.\" ",
    "By \"they\" he meant Dumbledore. he got back into bed and rolled over onto he with he back to \" ",
    "Ron and after a while he heard \" ",
    "Ron's mattress creak as he lay back down too. he scar began to burn; he bit hard on he pillow to stop he making a noise. Somewhere, he knew, Avery was being punished... ",
    "Harry and \" ",
    "Ron waited until break next morning to tell Hermione exactly what had happened. Harry and Ron wanted to be absolutely sure Harry and Ron could not be overheard. Standing in Harry and Ron usual corner of the cool and breezy courtyard, Harry told Harry every detail of the dream Harry could remember. When Harry had finished, Harry said nothing at all for a few moments, but stared with a kind of painful intensity at Fred and George, who were both headless and selling both magical hats from under both cloaks on the other side of the yard. ",
    "\"So that's why both killed him,\" Harry said quietly, withdrawing Harry gaze from Fred and George George at last. \"When Bode tried to steal this weapon, something funny happened to Bode. I think there must be defensive spells on it, or around it, to stop people from touching it. That's why Bode was in St. Mungo's, Bode brain had gone all funny and Bode couldn't talk. But remember what the Healer told both? Bode was recovering. And they couldn't risk Bode getting better, could they? I mean, the shock of whatever happened when Bode touched this weapon probably made the Imperius Curse lift. Once Bode'd got Bode voice back, Bode'd explain what Bode'd been doing, wouldn't Bode? they would have known Bode'd been sent to steal this weapon. Of course, it would have been easy for ",
    "Lucius Malfoy to put the curse on Lucius Malfoy. Never out of The Ministry, is Bode?\" ",
    "\"Bode was even hanging around that day I had my hearing,\" said Harry. \"In the -- hang on ...\" Bode said slowly. \"Bode was in the Department of Mysteries corridor that day! Your dad said Your dad was probably trying to sneak down and find out what happened in my hearing, but what if -- \" ",
    "\"Sturgis,\" gasped Hermione, looking thunderstruck. ",
    "\"Sorry?\" said \" ",
    "Ron, looking bewildered. ",
    "\"Sturgis Podmore,\" said Hermione, breathlessly. \"Arrested for trying to get through a door. Lucius Malfoy got Lucius Malfoy too. I bet Lucius Malfoy did it the day you saw Lucius Malfoy there, Harry. Sturgis had Moody's Invisibility Cloak, right? So what if Lucius Malfoy was standing guard by the door, invisible, and Lucius Malfoy heard Lucius Malfoy move, or guessed Lucius Malfoy was there, or just did the Imperius Curse on the off chance that a guard was there? So when Sturgis next had an opportunity -- probably when it was Sturgis turn on guard duty again -- Sturgis tried to get into the Department of Mysteries to steal this weapon for Voldemort -- Ron, be quiet -- but Sturgis got caught and sent to Azkaban...\" ",
    "She gazed at Harry. ",
    "\"And now \" ",
    "Rookwood's told Voldemort how to get this weapon?\" ",
    "\"I didn't hear all the conversation, but that's what it sounded like,\" said Harry. \"\" ",
    "Rookwood used to work there... Maybe Voldemort'll send \" ",
    "Rookwood to do it?\" ",
    "Hermione nodded, apparently still lost in thought. Then, quite abruptly, \" ",
    "Hermione said, \"But you shouldn't have seen this at all, Harry.\" ",
    "\"What?\" he said, taken aback. ",
    "\"You're supposed to be learning how to close your mind to this sort of thing,\" said Hermione, suddenly stern. ",
    "\"I know I am,\" said Harry. \"But -- \" ",
    "\"Well, I think we should just try and forget what you saw,\" said Hermione firmly. \"And you ought to put in a bit more effort on your Occlumency from now on.\" ",
    "Harry was so angry with Harry that Harry did not talk to Harry for the rest of the day, which proved to be another bad one. When people were not discussing the escaped Death Eaters in the corridors today, people were laughing at Gryffindor's abysmal performance in people match against Hufflepuff; the Slytherins were singing \"Weasley Is Our King\" so loudly and frequently that by sundown Filch had banned Filch from the corridors out of sheer irritation. ",
    "The week did not improve as Filch progressed: Harry received two more D's in Potions, was still on tenterhooks that Hagrid might get the sack, and could not stop Hagrid from dwelling on the dream in which Hagrid had seen Voldemort, though Hagrid did not bring it up with \" ",
    "Ron and Hermione again because Hagrid did not want another telling-off from Hermione. Hagrid wished very much that Hagrid could have talked to Sirius about it, but that was out of the question, so Hagrid tried to push the matter to the back of Hagrid mind. ",
    "Unfortunately, the back of his mind his mind was no longer the secure place his mind had once been. ",
    "\"Get up, Potter.\" ",
    "A couple of weeks after Potter dream of \" ",
    "Rookwood, Harry was to be found, yet again, kneeling on the floor of Snape's office, trying to clear his head. Harry had just been forced, yet again, to relive a stream of very early memories Harry had not even realized Harry still had, most of them concerning humiliations Dudley and Harry gang had inflicted upon Harry in primary school. ",
    "\"That last memory,\" said Snape. \"What was it?\" ",
    "\"I don't know,\" said Harry, getting wearily to his feet. Harry was finding it increasingly difficult to disentangle separate memories from the rush of images and sound that Snape kept calling forth. \"You mean the one where my cousin tried to make me stand in the toilet?\" ",
    "\"No,\" said Snape softly. \"I mean the one concerning a man kneeling in the middle of a darkened room...\" ",
    "\"It's ... nothing,\" said Harry. ",
    "Snape's dark eyes bored into Harry's. Remembering what Snape had said about eye contact being crucial to Legilimency, Harry blinked and looked away. ",
    "\"How do that man and that room come to be inside your head, Potter?\" said Snape. ",
    "\"It -- \" said Harry, looking everywhere but at Snape, ",
    "\"it was -- just a dream I had.\" ",
    "\"A dream,\" repeated Snape. ",
    "There was a pause during which Harry stared fixedly at a large dead frog suspended in a purple liquid in a pause during which Harry stared fixedly at a large dead frog suspended in a purple liquid in its jar jar. ",
    "\"You do know why we are here, don't you, Potter?\" said Snape in a low, dangerous voice. \"You do know why I am giving up my evenings to this tedious job?\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Harry stiffly. ",
    "\"Remind me why we are here, Potter.\" ",
    "\"So I can learn Occlumency,\" said Harry, now glaring at a dead eel. ",
    "\"Correct, Potter. And dim though you may be\" -- Harry looked back at Snape, hating Harry -- \"I would have thought that after two months' worth of lessons you might have made some progress. How many other dreams about the Dark Lord have you had?\" ",
    "\"Just that one,\" lied Harry. ",
    "\"Perhaps,\" said Snape, Snape dark, cold eyes narrowing slightly, \"perhaps you actually enjoy having these visions and dreams, Potter. Maybe they make you feel special -- important?\" ",
    "\"No, they don't,\" said Harry, Harry jaw set and Harry fingers clenched tightly around the handle of Harry wand. ",
    "\"That is just as well, Potter,\" said Snape coldly, \"because you are neither special nor important, and it is not up to you to find out what the Dark Lord is saying to Snape Death Eaters.\" ",
    "\"No -- that's your job, isn't it?\" Harry shot at Harry. ",
    "Harry had not meant to say it; it had burst out of Harry in temper. For a long moment they stared at each other, Harry convinced Harry had gone too far. But there was a ",
    "curious, almost satisfied expression on Snape's face when Harry answered. ",
    "\"Yes, Potter,\" Harry said, Harry eyes glinting. \"That is my job. Now, if you are ready, we will start again...\" ",
    "Harry raised his wand. \"One -- two -- three -- LegilimensV' ",
    "A hundred dementors were swooping toward Harry across the lake in the grounds... Harry screwed up Harry face in concentration... They were coming closer... Harry could see the dark holes beneath They hoods . . . yet Harry could also see Snape standing in front of Snape, his eyes fixed upon Harry's face, muttering under Snape breath... And somehow, Snape was growing clearer, and A hundred dementors were growing fainter . . . ",
    "Harry raised his wand. ",
    "\"Protegol\" ",
    "Snape staggered; \"Protegol\" ",
    "Snape flew upward, away from Harry -- and suddenly Harry's mind was teeming with memories that were not \"Protegol\" ",
    "Snape -- a hook-nosed man was shouting at a cowering woman, while a small dark-haired boy cried in a corner. . . A greasy-haired teenager sat alone in a dark bedroom, pointing A greasy-haired teenager at the ceiling, shooting down flies... A girl was laughing as a scrawny boy tried to mount a bucking broomstick -- ",
    "\"ENOUGH!\" ",
    "Harry felt as though Harry had been pushed hard in the chest; Harry took several staggering steps backward, hit some of the shelves covering Snape's walls and heard something crack. Snape was shaking slightly, very white in the face. ",
    "The back of Harry's robes were damp. One of the jars behind Snape had broken when Snape fell against the jars behind him; the pickled slimy thing within was swirling in the jars behind him draining potion. ",
    "\"Reparo\\\" hissed Snape, and the jar sealed \"Reparo\\\" once more. \"Well, Potter ... that was certainly an improvement...\" Panting slightly, Snape straightened the Pensieve in which Snape had again stored some of Snape thoughts before starting the lesson, almost as though checking that they were still there. \"I don't remember telling you to use a Shield Charm . . . but there is no doubt that it was effective...\" ",
    "Harry did not speak; Harry felt that to say anything might be dangerous. Harry was sure Harry had just broken into Snape's memories, that Harry had just seen scenes from Snape's childhood, and it was unnerving to think that a scrawny boy was actually standing in front of Harry with such loathing in Harry eyes... ",
    "\"Let's try again, shall 's?\" said Snape. ",
    "Harry felt a thrill of dread: Harry was about to pay for what had just happened, Harry was sure of it. They moved back into position with the desk between They, Harry feeling Harry was going to find it much harder to empty Harry mind this time... ",
    "\"On the count of three, then,\" said Snape, raising his wand once more. \"One -- two -- \" ",
    "Harry did not have time to gather Harry together and attempt to clear Harry mind, for Snape had already cried \" Legilimens\\\" ",
    "Snape was hurtling along the corridor toward the Department of Mysteries, past the blank stone walls, ",
    "past the torches -- the plain black door was growing ever larger; Snape was moving so fast Snape was going to collide with the plain black door, Snape was feet from the plain black door and Snape could see that chink of faint blue light again -- ",
    "the plain black door had flown open! Snape was through the plain black door at last, inside a black-walled, black-floored circular room lit with blue-flamed candles, and there were more doors all around Snape -- Snape needed to go on -- but which door ought Snape to take -- ? ",
    "\"POTTER!\" ",
    "Harry opened his eyes. Harry was flat on Harry back again with no memory of having gotten there; Harry was also panting as though Harry really had run the length of the Department of Mysteries Mysteries corridor, really had sprinted through the plain black door and found the circular room...

    "\"Explain yourself!\" said Snape, who was standing over Harry, looking furious. ",
    "\"I ... dunno what happened,\" said Harry truthfully, standing up. There was a lump on the back of his head from where Harry had hit the ground and Harry felt feverish. \"I've never seen that before. I mean, I told you, I've dreamed about the plain black door ... but it's never opened before...\" ",
    "\"You are not working hard enough!\" ",
    "For some reason, Snape seemed even angrier than Harry had done two minutes before, when Harry had seen into Snape's memories. ",
    "\"You are lazy and sloppy, Potter, it is small wonder that the Dark Lord -- \" ",
    "\"Can you tell me something, sir?\" said Harry, firing up again. \"Why do you call Voldemort the Dark Lord, I've only ever heard Death Eaters call the Dark Lord that -- Snape Snape opened the Dark Lord mouth in a snarl -- and a woman screamed from somewhere outside the room. ",
    "Snape's head jerked upward; Snape's head was gazing at the ceiling. ",
    "\"What the -- ?\" Snape's head muttered. ",
    "Harry could hear a muffled commotion coming from what Harry thought might be the entrance hall. Snape looked around at Snape, frowning. ",
    "\"Did you see anything unusual on your way down here, Potter?\" ",
    "Harry shook Snape . Somewhere above them, a woman screamed again. Snape strode to Snape office door, his wand still held at the ready, and swept out of sight. Harry hesitated for a moment, then followed. ",
    "The screams were indeed coming from the entrance hall; The screams grew louder as Harry ran toward the stone steps leading up from the dungeons. When Harry reached the top Harry found the entrance hall packed. Students had come flooding out of the Great Hall, where dinner was still in progress, to see what was going on. Others had crammed Others onto the marble staircase. Harry pushed forward through a knot of tall Slytherins and saw that the onlookers had formed a great ring, some of the onlookers looking shocked, others even frightened. Professor McGonagall was directly opposite Harry on the other side of the entrance hall; Professor McGonagall looked as though what Professor McGonagall was watching made Professor McGonagall feel faintly sick. ",
    "Professor McGonagall was standing in the middle of the entrance hall with Professor McGonagall in one hand and an empty sherry bottle in the other, looking utterly mad. Professor McGonagall hair was sticking up on end, Professor McGonagall glasses were lopsided so that one eye was magnified more than the other; Professor McGonagall innumerable shawls and scarves were trailing haphazardly from Professor McGonagall shoulders, giving the impression that Professor McGonagall was falling apart at the seams. Two large trunks lay on the floor beside Professor McGonagall, one of Two large trunks upside down; it looked very much as though it had been thrown down the stairs after Professor McGonagall. Professor McGonagall was staring, apparently terrified, at something Harry could not see but that seemed to be standing at the foot of the stairs. ",
    "\"No!\" Professor McGonagall shrieked. \"NO! This cannot be happening... ",
    "This cannot ... I refuse to accept This!\" ",
    "\"You didn't realize this was coming?\" said a high girlish voice, sounding callously amused, and Harry, moving slightly to Harry right, saw that Professor McGonagall's terrifying vision was nothing other than Professor Umbridge. \"Incapable though you are of predicting even tomorrow's weather, you must surely have realized that your pitiful performance during my inspections, and lack of any improvement, would make it inevitable you would be sacked?\" ",
    "\"You c-can't!\" howled Professor McGonagall, tears streaming down Professor McGonagall face from behind Professor McGonagall enormous lenses, \"you c-can't sack me! I've b-been here sixteen years! H-Hogwarts is m-my h-home!\" ",
    "\"It was your home,\" said Professor Umbridge, and Harry was revolted to see the enjoyment stretching H-Hogwarts as H-Hogwarts watched Professor Trelawney sink, sobbing uncontrollably, onto one of Professor McGonagall trunks, \"until an hour ago, when the Minister of Magic countersigned the order for your dismissal. Now  ",
    "kindly remove yourself from the entrance hall. You are embarrassing us.\" ",
    "But Professor McGonagall stood and watched, with an expression of gloating enjoyment, as Professor McGonagall shuddered and moaned, rocking backward and forward on Professor McGonagall trunk in paroxysms of grief. Harry heard a sob to Harry left and looked around. Lavender and Parvati were both crying silently, Lavender and Parvati arms around each other. Then Harry heard footsteps. ",
    "Professor McGonagall had broken away from the spectators, marched straight up to Professor McGonagall and was patting Professor McGonagall firmly on the back while withdrawing a large handkerchief from within Professor McGonagall robes. ",
    "\"There, there, Sibyll ... Calm down... Blow your nose on this... It's not as bad as you think, now... You are not going to have to leave Hogwarts...\" ",
    "\"Oh really, Professor McGonagall?\" said Professor Umbridge in a deadly voice, taking a few steps forward. \"And your authority for that statement is . . . ?\" ",
    "\"That would be mine,\" said a deep voice. ",
    "The oak front doors had swung open. Students beside The oak front doors scuttled out of the way as Dumbledore appeared in the entrance. What Dumbledore had been doing out in the grounds Harry could not imagine, but there was something impressive about the sight of Dumbledore framed in the doorway against an oddly misty night. Leaving The oak front doors wide behind Dumbledore, Dumbledore strode forward through the circle of onlookers toward the place where Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall sat, tearstained and trembling, upon Professor McGonagall trunk, Professor McGonagall alongside Professor McGonagall.

    "\"Yours, Professor Dumbledore?\" said Professor Umbridge with a singularly unpleasant little laugh. \"I'm afraid you do ",
    "not understand the position. I have here\" -- Professor Umbridge pulled a parchment scroll from within Professor Umbridge robes -- ",

    "To Harry's very great surprise, Dumbledore continued to smile. Dumbledore looked down at Professor Trelawney, who was still sobbing and choking on Professor McGonagall trunk, and said, \"You are quite right, of course, Professor Umbridge. ",
    "As the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts you have every right to dismiss my teachers. You do not, however, have the authority to send my teachers away from the castle. I am afraid,\" Dumbledore went on, with a courteous little bow, \"that the power to do that still resides with the headmaster, and it is my wish that Professor McGonagall continue to live at Hogwarts.\" ",
    "At this, Professor McGonagall gave a wild little laugh in which a hiccup was barely hidden. ",
    "\"No -- no, I'll g-go, Dumbledore! I sh-shall 1-leave Hogwarts and s-seek my fortune elsewhere -- \" ",
    "\"No,\" said Dumbledore sharply. \"It is my wish that you remain, Sibyll.\" ",
    "Professor McGonagall turned to Professor McGonagall. ",
    "\"Might I ask you to escort Sibyll back upstairs, Professor McGonagallProfessor McGonagall?\" ",
    "\"Of course,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Up you get, Sibyll...\" ",
    "Professor Sprout came hurrying forward out of the crowd and grabbed Professor McGonagall's other arm. Together they guided \" ",
    "Professor Sprout past Professor Umbridge and up the marble stairs. \" ",
    "Professor Sprout went scurrying after they, \" ",
    "Professor Sprout held out before \" ",
    "Professor Sprout; \" ",
    "Professor Sprout squeaked, \"Locomotor trunksl\" and Professor McGonagall's luggage rose into the air and proceeded up the marble staircase after \" ",
    "Professor Sprout, Professor Flitwick bringing up the rear. ",
    "Professor Umbridge was standing stock-still, staring at Dumbledore, who continued to smile benignly. ",
    "\"And what,\" Professor Umbridge said in a whisper that nevertheless carried all around the entrance hall, \"are you going to do with Professor Umbridge once I appoint a new Divination teacher who needs Professor Umbridge lodgings?\" ",
    "\"Oh, that won't be a problem,\" said Dumbledore pleasantly. \"You see, I have already found us a new Divination teacher, and us a new Divination teacher will prefer lodgings on the ground floor.\" ",
    "\"You've found -- ?\" said Professor Umbridge shrilly. \"You've found? Might I remind you, Dumbledore, that under Educational Decree Twenty-two -- \" ",
    "\" -- the Ministry has the right to appoint a suitable candidate if -- and only if -- the headmaster is unable to find one,\" said Dumbledore. \"And I am happy to say that on this occasion I have succeeded. May I introduce you?\" ",
    "Dumbledore turned to face the open front doors, through which night mist was now drifting. Harry heard hooves. There was a shocked murmur around the entrance hall and those nearest the doors hastily moved even farther backward, some of those tripping over in some of them haste to clear a path for the newcomer. ",
    "Through mist came a face Harry had seen once before on a dark, dangerous night in the Forbidden Forest: white-blond hair and astonishingly blue eyes, the head and torso of a man joined to the palomino body of a horse. ",
    "\"This is Firenze,\" said Dumbledore happily to a thunderstruck Umbridge. \"I think you 11 find him suitable.\" "

  "THE CENTAUR AND THE SNEAK": [
    "\"I'll bet you wish you hadn't given up Divination now, don't you, Hermione?\" asked Parvati, smirking. ",
    "It was breakfast time a few days after the sacking of Professor McGonagall, and Parvati was curling Parvati eyelashes around Parvati and examining the effect in the back of Parvati spoon. They were to have They first lesson with Firenze that morning. ",
    "\"Not really,\" said Hermione indifferently, who was reading the Daily Prophet \"I've never really liked horses.\" ",
    "Parvati turned a page of the newspaper, scanning the newspaper columns. ",
    "\"He's not a horse, He's a centaur!\" said Lavender, sounding shocked. ",
    "\"A gorgeous centaur ...\" sighed Parvati. ",
    "\"Either way, He's still got four legs,\" said Hermione coolly. \"Anyway, I thought you two were all upset that Professor McGonagall had gone?\" ",
    "\"We are!\" Lavender assured Lavender. \"We went up to Lavender office to see Lavender, We took Lavender some daffodils -- not the honking ones that Sprout's got, nice ones...\" ",
    "\"How is Lavender?\" asked Harry. ",
    "\"Not very good, poor thing,\" said Lavender sympathetically. \"Lavender was crying and saying Lavender'd rather leave the castle forever than stay here if Professor Umbridge is still here, and I don't blame Lavender. ",
    "Professor Umbridge was horrible to Lavender, wasn't Lavender?\" ",
    "\"I've got a feeling Professor Umbridge has only just started being horrible,\" said Hermione darkly. ",
    "\"Impossible,\" said Ron, who was tucking into a large plate of eggs and bacon. \"Lavender can't get any worse than Lavender's been already.\" ",
    "\"You mark my words, Lavender's going to want revenge on Dumbledore for appointing a new teacher without consulting Lavender,\" said Hermione, closing the newspaper. \"Especially another part-human. You saw the look on Lavender face when Lavender saw Firenze...\" ",
    "After breakfast Hermione departed for Lavender Arithmancy class and Harry and Ron followed Parvati and Lavender into the entrance hall, heading for Divination. ",
    "\"Aren't we going up to North Tower?\" asked Ron, looking puzzled, as Parvati bypassed the marble staircase. ",
    "Parvati looked scornfully over Parvati shoulder at Ron. ",
    "\"How d'you expect Firenze to climb that ladder? we're in classroom eleven now, it was on the notice board yesterday.\" ",
    "Classroom eleven was situated in the ground-floor corridor leading off the entrance hall on the opposite side to the entrance hall. Harry knew it to be one of those classrooms that were never used regularly, and that it therefore had the slightly neglected feeling of a cupboard or storeroom. When Harry entered it right behind Ron, and found Harry right in the middle of a forest clearing, Harry was therefore momentarily stunned. ",
    "\"What the -- ?\" ",
    "The classroom floor had become springily mossy and trees were growing out of The classroom floor; trees leafy branches fanned across the ceiling and windows, so that the room was full of slanting shafts of soft, dappled, green light. The students who had already arrived were sitting on The classroom floor with The students who had already arrived backs resting against tree trunks or boulders, arms wrapped around The students who had already arrived knees or folded tightly across The students who had already arrived chests, looking rather nervous. In the middle of the room, where there were no trees, stood Firenze. ",
    "\"Harry Potter,\" he said, holding out a hand when Harry entered. ",
    "\"Er -- hi,\" said Harry, shaking hands with the centaur, who surveyed Harry unblinkingly through those astonishingly blue eyes but did not smile. \"Er -- good to see you ...\" ",
    "\"And you,\" said the centaur, inclining his white-blond head. \"It was foretold that we would meet again.\" ",
    "Harry noticed that there was the shadow of a hoof- shaped bruise on Firenze's chest. As Harry turned to join the rest of the class upon The classroom floor, Harry saw that they were all looking at Harry with awe, apparently deeply impressed that Harry was on speaking terms with Firenze, whom they seemed to find intimidating. ",
    "When the door was closed and the last student had sat down upon a tree stump beside the wastepaper basket, Firenze gestured around the room. ",
    "Dumbledore has kindly arranged this classroom for us,\" said Firenze, when everyone had settled down, \"in imitation of my natural habitat. I would have preferred to teach you in the Forbidden Forest, which was -- until Monday -- my home ... but this is not possible.\" ",
    "\"Please -- er -- sir -- \" said Parvati breathlessly, raising Parvati hand, \"why not? us've been in there with Hagrid, us're not frightened!\" ",
    "\"It is not a question of your bravery,\" said Firenze, \"but of my position. I can no longer return to the forest. My herd has banished me.\" ",
    "\"Herd?\" said Lavender in a confused voice, and Harry knew Lavender was thinking of cows. \"What -- oh!\" Comprehension dawned on Lavender . \"There are more of you?\" Lavender said, stunned. ",
    "\"Hagrid breed you, like the thestrals?\" asked Dean eagerly. ",
    "Firenze turned Dean head very slowly to face Dean, who seemed to realize at once that Dean had said something very offensive. ",
    "\"I didn't -- I meant -- sorry,\" Dean finished in a hushed voice. ",
    "\"Centaurs are not the servants or playthings of humans,\" said Firenze quietly. There was a pause, then Parvati raised Parvati hand again. ",
    "\"Please, sir ... why have \"Centaurs banished you?\" ",
    "\"Because I have agreed to work for Dumbledore,\" said Firenze. \"\"Centaurs see this as a betrayal of our kind.\" ",
    "Harry remembered how, nearly four years ago, the centaur Bane had shouted at Firenze for allowing Harry to ride to safety upon Harry back, calling Harry a \"common mule.\" Harry wondered whether it had been Bane who had kicked Firenze in the chest. ",
    "\"Let us begin,\" said Firenze. Harry swished Harry long palomino tail, raised Harry hand toward the leafy canopy overhead then lowered the leafy canopy slowly, and as Harry did so, the light in the room dimmed, so that they now seemed to be sitting in a forest clearing by twilight, and stars emerged upon the ceiling. There were oohs and gasps, and Ron said audibly, \"Blimey!\" ",
    "\"Lie back upon The classroom floor,\" said Firenze in Firenze calm voice, \"and observe the heavens. Here is written, for those who can see, the fortune of our races.\" ",
    "Harry stretched out on \" ",
    "Harry and gazed upward at the ceiling. A twinkling red star winked at \" ",
    "Harry from overhead. ",
    "\"I know that you have learned the names of the planets and you have learned the names of the planets and their moons in Astronomy moons in Astronomy,\" said Firenze's calm voice, \"and that you have mapped the stars' ",
    "progress through the heavens. \"Centaurs have unraveled the mysteries of these movements over centuries. Our findings teach Our that the future may be glimpsed in the sky above us...\" ",
    "\"Professor Trelawney did Astrology with Our!\" said Parvati excitedly, raising his hand in front of Parvati so that it stuck up in the air as Parvati lay on Parvati back. \"Mars causes accidents and burns and things like that, and when it makes an angle to Saturn, like now\" -- Parvati drew a right angle in the air above Parvati -- \"that means that people need to be extra careful when handling hot things -- \" ",
    "\"That,\" said Firenze calmly, \"is human nonsense.\" ",
    "Parvati's hand fell limply to \" ",
    "Parvati side. ",
    "\"Trivial hurts, tiny human accidents,\" said Firenze, as Firenze hooves thudded over the mossy floor. \"These are of no more significance than the scurryings of ants to the wide universe, and are unaffected by planetary movements.\" ",
    "\"Professor Trelawney -- \" began Parvati, in a hurt and indignant voice. ",
    "\" -- is a human,\" said Firenze simply. \"And is therefore blinkered and fettered by the limitations of your kind.\" ",
    "Harry turned his head very slightly to look at Parvati. Harry looked very offended, as did several of the people surrounding Harry. ",
    "\"Sibyll Trelawney may have Seen, I do not know,\" continued Firenze, and Harry heard the swishing of Harry tail again as Harry walked up and down before them, \"but Harry wastes Harry time, in the main, on the self- ",
    "flattering nonsense humans call fortune-telling. I, however, am here to explain the wisdom of centaurs, which is impersonal and impartial. We watch the skies for the great tides of evil or change that are sometimes marked there. It may take ten years to be sure of what we are seeing.\" ",
    "Firenze pointed to the red star directly above Harry. ",
    "\"In the past decade, the indications have been that Wizard-kind is living through nothing more than a brief calm between two wars. Mars, bringer of battle, shines brightly above us, suggesting that the fight must break out again soon. How soon, \"Centaurs may attempt to divine by the burning of certain herbs and leaves, by the observation of fume and flame...\" ",
    "It was the most unusual lesson Harry had ever attended. They did indeed burn sage and mallowsweet there on the classroom floor, and Firenze told They to look for certain shapes and symbols in the pungent fumes, but Firenze seemed perfectly unconcerned that not one of They could see any of the signs Firenze described, telling They that humans were hardly ever good at this, that it took centaurs years and years to become competent, and finished by telling They that it was foolish to put too much faith in such things anyway, because even centaurs sometimes read They wrongly. Firenze was nothing like any human teacher Harry had ever had. Firenze priority did not seem to be to teach They what Firenze knew, but rather to impress upon They that nothing, not even centaurs' knowledge, was foolproof. ",
    "\"Firenze's not very definite on anything, is Firenze?\" said Ron in a low voice, as they put out they mallowsweet fire. \"I mean, I could do with a few more details about this war we're about to have, couldn't you?\" ",
    "The bell rang right outside the classroom door and everyone jumped; Harry had completely forgotten that everyone were still inside the castle, quite convinced that Harry was really in the forest. The class filed out, looking slightly perplexed; Harry and Ron were on the point of following them when Firenze called, \"Harry Potter, a word, please.\" ",
    "Harry turned. The centaur advanced a little toward Harry. Ron hesitated. ",
    "\"You may stay,Firenze told Ron. \"But close the door, please.Ron Ron hastened to obey. ",
    "\"Harry Potter, you are a friend of Hagrid, are you not?\" said The centaur. ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Then give Harry a warning from Ron. Harry attempt is not working. Harry would do better to abandon His attempt.\" ",
    "\"His attempt is not working?\" Harry repeated blankly. ",
    "\"And Harry would do better to abandon His attempt,\" said Firenze, nodding. \"I would warn Hagrid Ron, but I am banished -- Hagrid would be unwise for me to go too near the forest now -- Hagrid has troubles enough, without a centaurs' battle.\" ",
    "\"But -- what's Hagrid attempting to do?\" said Harry nervously. ",
    "Firenze looked at Harry impassively. ",
    "Hagrid has recently rendered me a great service,\" said Firenze, \"and Hagrid has long since earned my ",
    "respect for the care Hagrid shows all living creatures. I shall not betray Hagrid secret. But Hagrid must be brought to Hagrid senses. His attempt is not working. Tell Hagrid, \"Harry Potter. Good day to Hagrid.\" ",
    "The happiness Harry had felt in the aftermath of The Quibbler interview had long since evaporated. As a dull March blurred into a squally April, Hagrid life seemed to have become one long series of worries and problems again. ",
    "Umbridge had continued attending all Care of Magical Creatures lessons, so it had been very difficult to deliver Firenze's warning to Hagrid. At Harry Harry had managed Firenze's warning by pretending Harry had lost Harry copy of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and doubling back after class one day. When Harry passed on Firenze's message, Hagrid gazed at Harry for a moment through Harry puffy, blackened eyes, apparently taken aback. Then Harry seemed to pull Harry together. ",
    "\"Nice bloke, Firenze,\" Harry said gruffly, \"but Harry don' know what Harry's talkin' abou' on this. The attemp's cornin' on fine.\" ",
    "Hagrid, what're you up to?\" asked Harry seriously. \"Because you've got to be careful, Umbridge has already sacked Trelawney and if you ask me, Umbridge's on a roll. If you're doing anything you shouldn't be -- \" ",
    "\"There's things more importan' than keepin' a job,\" said Hagrid, though Hagrid hands shook slightly as Hagrid said this and a basin full of knarl droppings crashed to the floor. \"Don' worry abou' me, Harry, jus' get along now, there's a good lad...\" ",
    "Harry had no choice but to leave Hagrid mopping up the dung all over the floor, but Harry felt thoroughly dispirited as Harry trudged back up to the castle. ",
    "Meanwhile, as the teachers and Hermione persisted in reminding the teachers and Hermione, the O.W.L.s were drawing ever nearer. All the fifth years were suffering from stress to some degree, but Hannah Abbott became the first to receive a Calming Draught from Madam Pomfrey after Hannah Abbott burst into tears during Herbology and sobbed that Hannah Abbott was too stupid to take exams and wanted to leave school now. ",
    "If it had not been for the D.A. lessons, Harry thought Harry would have been extremely unhappy. Harry sometimes felt that Harry was living for the hours Harry spent in the Room of Requirement, working hard but thoroughly enjoying Harry at the same time, swelling with pride as Harry looked around at Harry fellow D.A. members and saw how far his fellow D.A. members had come. ",
    "Indeed, Harry sometimes wondered how Umbridge was going to react when all the members of the D.A. received \"Outstanding\" in all the members of the D.A. Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L.s. ",
    "all the members of the D.A. had finally started work on Patronuses, which everybody had been very keen to practice, though as Harry kept reminding all the members of the D.A., producing a Patronus in the middle of a brightly lit classroom when all the members of the D.A. were not under threat was very different to producing it when confronted by something like a dementor. ",
    "\"Oh, don't be such a killjoy,\" said Cho brightly, watching her silvery swan-shaped Patronus soar around the Room of Requirement Requirement during all the members of the D.A. last lesson before Easter. \"all the members of the D.A.'re so pretty!\" ",
    "\"all the members of the D.A.'re not supposed to be pretty, all the members of the D.A.'re supposed to protect you,\" said Harry patiently. \"What we really ",
    "need is a boggart or something; that's how I learned, I had to conjure a Patronus while the boggart was pretending to be a dementor -- \" ",
    "\"But that would be really scary!\" said Lavender, who was shooting puffs of silver vapor out of the end of her wand. \"And I still -- can't -- do it!\" her added angrily. ",
    "Neville was having trouble too. Neville face was screwed up in concentration, but only feeble wisps of silver smoke issued from Neville wand tip. ",
    "\"You've got to think of something happy,Harry Harry reminded Neville. ",
    "\"I'm trying,\" said Neville miserably, who was trying so hard His face was actually shining with sweat. ",
    "HarryHarry, I think I'm doing it!\" yelled Seamus, who had been brought along to Neville first ever D.A. meeting by Dean. \"Look -- ah -- it's gone... But it was definitely something hairy, Harry!\" ",
    "Hermione's Patronus, a shining silver otter, was gamboling around her. ",
    "\"They are sort of nice, aren't They?\" she said, looking at it fondly. ",
    "The door of the Room of Requirement opened and then closed again; Harry looked around to see who had entered, but there did not seem to be anybody there. It was a few moments before Harry realized that the people close to The door of the Room of Requirement had fallen silent. Next thing Harry knew, something was tugging at Harry robes somewhere near the knee. Harry looked down and saw, to Harry very great astonishment, Dobby the house-elf peering up at Harry from beneath Harry usual eight hats.  ",
    "\"Hi, Dobby!\" Harry said. \"What are you -- what's wrong?\" ",
    "For the elf's eyes were wide with terror and Harry was shaking. The members of the D.A. closest to Harry had fallen silent now: Everybody in the room was watching Dobby. The few Patronuses people had managed to conjure faded away into silver mist, leaving the room looking much darker than before. ",
    "\"Harry Potter, sir ...\" squeaked the elf, trembling from head to foot, \"\"Harry Potter, sir ... Dobby has come to warn you . . . but the house-elves have been warned not to tell ...\" ",
    "Dobby ran headfirst at the wall: Harry, who had some experience of Dobby's habits of self-punishment, made to seize Dobby, but Dobby merely bounced off the stone, cushioned by Dobby eight hats. Hermione and a few of the other girls let out squeaks of fear and sympathy. ",
    "\"What's happened, Dobby?\" Harry asked, grabbing the elf's tiny arm and holding Harry away from anything with which Harry might seek to hurt Harry. ",
    "\"\"Harry Potter ... she ... she ...Dobby Dobby hit Dobby hard on the nose with Dobby free fist: Harry seized that too. ",
    "\"Who's 'she,' Dobby?\" ",
    "But Dobby thought Dobby knew -- surely only one \"she\" could induce such fear in Dobby? the elf looked up at Dobby, slightly cross-eyed, and mouthed wordlessly. ",
    "\"Umbridge?\" asked Harry, horrified. ",
    "Dobby nodded, then tried to bang Dobby head off Harry's knees; Harry held Harry at bay. ",
    "\"What about she? Dobby -- she hasn't found out about this -- about us -- about the D.A.?\" ",
    "Dobby read the answer in the elf's stricken face. Dobby hands held fast by Harry, the elf tried to kick Dobby and fell to the floor. ",
    "\"Is she coming?\" Harry asked quietly. ",
    "Dobby let out a howl, and began beating Dobby bare feet hard on the floor. \"Yes, \"Harry Potter, yes!Harry Harry straightened up and looked around at the motionless, terrified people gazing at the elf. ",
    "\"WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?\" Harry bellowed. \"RUN!\" ",
    "They all pelted toward the exit at once, forming a scrum at The door of the Room of Requirement, then people burst through; Harry could hear people sprinting along the corridors and hoped people had the sense not to try and make it all the way to people dormitories. It was only ten to nine, if people just took refuge in the library or the Owlery, which were both nearer -- ",
    "\"Harry, come on!\" shrieked Hermione from the center of the knot of people now fighting to get out. ",
    "Harry scooped up Dobby, who was still attempting to do Harry serious injury, and ran with the elf in Harry arms to join the back of the queue. ",
    "\"Dobby -- this is an order -- get back down to the kitchen with the other elves, and if she asks you ",
    "whether you warned me, lie and say no!\" said Harry. \"And I forbid you to hurt Harry!\" Harry added, dropping the elf as Harry made the elf over the threshold at last and slamming The door of the Room of Requirement behind Harry. ",
    "\"Thank you, \"Harry Potter!\" squeaked Dobby, and \"Harry Potter streaked off. Harry glanced left and right, the others were all moving so fast that \"Harry Potter caught only glimpses of flying heels at either end of the corridor before the others vanished. \"Harry Potter started to run right; there was a boys' bathroom up ahead, \"Harry Potter could pretend \"Harry Potter'd been in there all the time if \"Harry Potter could just reach it -- ",
    "\"AAARGH!\" ",
    "Something caught \"Harry Potter around the ankles and \"Harry Potter fell spectacularly, skidding along on \"Harry Potter front for six feet before coming to a halt. Someone behind \"Harry Potter was laughing. \"Harry Potter rolled over onto \"Harry Potter back and saw Malfoy concealed in a niche beneath an ugly dragon-shaped vase. ",
    "\"Trip Jinx, \"Harry Potter!\" \"Harry Potter said. \"Hey, Professor -- PROFESSOR! I've got one!\" ",
    "Umbridge came bustling around the far corner, breathless but wearing a delighted smile. ",
    "\"It's \" ",
    "Umbridge!\" \" ",
    "Umbridge said jubilantly at the sight of Harry on the floor. \"Excellent, Draco, excellent, oh, very good -- fifty points to Slytherin! I'll take \"Harry Potter from here... ",
    "Stand up, \"Harry Potter!\" ",
    "Harry got to six feet, glaring at the pair of them. Harry had never seen Umbridge looking so happy. \" ",
    "Umbridge seized Harry arm in a vicelike grip and turned, beaming broadly, to Malfoy. \"You hop along and see if you can round up anymore of them, Draco,\" \" ",
    "Umbridge said. \"Tell the others to look in the library -- anybody out of breath  ",
    "-- check the bathrooms, Miss Parkinson can do the girls' ones -- off you go -- and you,\" Miss Parkinson added in Miss Parkinson softest, most dangerous voice, as Malfoy walked away. \"You can come with me to the headmaster's office, \"Harry Potter.\" ",
    "the headmaster's office, Potter were at the stone gargoyle within minutes. Harry wondered how many of the others had been caught. ",
    "Harry thought of Ron -- Mrs. Weasley would kill Mrs. Weasley -- and of how Hermione would feel if Mrs. Weasley was expelled before Mrs. Weasley could take Mrs. Weasley O.W.L.s. And it had been Seamus's very first meeting ... and Neville had been getting so good... ",
    "\"Fizzing Whizbee,\" sang Umbridge, and the stone gargoyle jumped aside, the wall behind split open, and the stone gargoyle ascended the moving stone staircase. the stone gargoyle reached the polished door with the griffin knocker, but Umbridge did not bother to knock, Umbridge strode straight inside, still holding tight to Harry. ",
    "The office was full of people. Dumbledore was sitting behind Dumbledore desk, Dumbledore expression serene, the tips of Dumbledore long fingers together. Professor McGonagall stood rigidly beside Professor McGonagall, Professor McGonagall face extremely tense. Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic, was rocking backward and forward on Professor McGonagall toes beside the fire, apparently immensely pleased with the situation. Kingsley Shacklebolt and a tough-looking wizard Harry did not recognize with very short, wiry hair were positioned on either side of the door like guards, and the freckled, bespectacled form of Percy Weasley hovered excitedly beside the wall, a quill and a heavy scroll of parchment in Percy Weasley hands, apparently poised to take notes. ",
    "The portraits of old headmasters and mistresses were not shamming sleep tonight. All of The portraits of old headmasters and mistresses were watching what was happening below, alert and ",
    "serious. As Harry entered, a few flitted into neighboring frames and whispered urgently into their neighbors' ears. ",
    "Harry pulled Harry free of Umbridge's grasp as the door swung shut behind them. Cornelius Fudge was glaring at Cornelius Fudge with a kind of vicious satisfaction upon Cornelius Fudge face. ",
    "\"Well,\" Cornelius Fudge said. \"Well, well, well ...\" ",
    "Harry replied with the dirtiest look Harry could muster. Harry heart drummed madly inside Harry, but Harry brain was oddly cool and clear. ",
    "\"Harry was heading back to Gryffindor Tower,\" said Umbridge. There was an indecent excitement in Umbridge voice, the same callous pleasure Harry had heard as Umbridge watched Professor Trelawney dissolving with misery in the entrance hall. \"The Malfoy boy cornered The Malfoy boy.\" ",
    "\"Did The Malfoy boy, did The Malfoy boy?\" said Cornelius Fudge appreciatively. \"I must remember to tell Lucius. Well, \"Harry Potter ... I expect you know why you are here?Harry Harry fully intended to respond with a defiant \"yes\": Harry mouth had opened and the word was half formed when Harry caught sight of Dumbledore's face. Dumbledore was not looking directly at Harry; Dumbledore eyes were fixed upon a point just over Dumbledore shoulder, but as Harry stared at Harry, Harry shook Harry head a fraction of an inch to each side. ",
    "Harry changed direction mid- word. ",
    "\"Harry -- no.\" ",
    "\"I beg your pardon?\" said Fudge. ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry, firmly. ",
    "\"You don't know why you are here?\" ",
    "\"No, I don't,\" said Harry. ",
    "Fudge looked incredulously from Harry to Umbridge; Harry took advantage of Harry momentary inattention to steal another quick look at Dumbledore, who gave the carpet the tiniest of nods and the shadow of a wink. ",
    "\"So you have no idea,\" said Fudge in a voice positively sagging with sarcasm, \"why Umbridge has brought you to The office? You are not aware that you have broken any school rules?\" ",
    "\"School rules?\" said Harry. \"No.\" ",
    "\"Or Ministry decrees?\" amended Fudge angrily. ",
    "\"Not that I'm aware of,\" said Harry blandly. ",
    "Harry heart was still hammering very fast. It was almost worth telling these lies to watch Fudge's blood pressure rising, but Harry could not see how on earth Harry would get away with how on earth. If somebody had tipped off Umbridge about the D.A. then he, the leader, might as well be packing he trunk right now. ",
    "\"So it's news to you, is it,\" said Fudge, Harry voice now thick with anger, \"that an illegal student organization has been discovered within this school?\" ",
    "\"Yes, it is,\" said Harry, hoisting an unconvincing look of innocent surprise onto Harry face. ",
    "\"I think, Minister,\" said Umbridge silkily from beside Umbridge, \"we might make better progress if I fetch we informant.\" ",
    "\"Yes, yes, do,\" said Fudge, nodding, and he glanced maliciously at Dumbledore as Umbridge left the room. \"There's nothing like a good witness, is there, Dumbledore?\" ",
    "\"Nothing at all, Cornelius,\" said Dumbledore gravely, inclining Dumbledore head. ",
    "There was a wait of several minutes, in which nobody looked at each other, then Harry heard the door open behind Harry. Umbridge moved past Harry into the room, gripping by the shoulder Cho's curly-haired friend Marietta, who was hiding Cho face in Cho hands. ",
    "\"Don't be scared, dear, don't be frightened,\" said Umbridge softly, patting Cho on the back, \"it's quite all right, now. You have done the right thing. Minister is very pleased with you. Minister'll be telling your mother what a good girl you've been. Marietta's mother, Minister,\" Marietta's mother, Minister added, looking up at Fudge, \"is Madam Edgecombe from the Department of Magical Transportation. Floo Network office -- Cho's been helping us police the Hogwarts fires, you know.\" ",
    "\"Jolly good, jolly good!\" said Fudge heartily. \"Like mother, like daughter, eh? Well, come on, now, dear, look up, don't be shy, let's hear what you've got to -- galloping gargoyles!\" ",
    "As Marietta raised Cho head, Cornelius Fudge leapt backward in shock, nearly landing Cornelius Fudge in the fire. Cornelius Fudge cursed and stamped on the hem of Cornelius Fudge cloak, which had started to smoke, and Marietta gave a wail and pulled the neck of Cho robes right up to Cho eyes, but not before the room had seen that her face was  ",
    "horribly disfigured by a series of close- set purple pustules that had spread across Cho nose and cheeks to form the word \"SNEAK.\" ",
    "\"Never mind the spots now, dear,\" said Umbridge impatiently, \"just take her robes away from your mouth and tell Minister -- \" ",
    "But Marietta gave another muffled wail and shook her head frantically. ",
    "\"Oh, very well, Cho, I'll tell Minister,\" snapped Umbridge. her hitched her sickly smile back onto her and said, \"Well, Minister, Miss Edgecombe here came to The office shortly after dinner this evening and told me her had something her wanted to tell me. her said that if I proceeded to a secret room on the seventh floor, sometimes known as the Room of Requirement, I would find out something to my advantage. I questioned her a little further and her admitted that there was to be some kind of meeting there. Unfortunately at that point this hex,\" her waved impatiently at Marietta's concealed face, \"came into operation and upon catching sight of her in my mirror her became too distressed to tell me any more.\" ",
    "\"Well, now,\" said Fudge, fixing Marietta with what Fudge evidently imagined was a kind and fatherly look. \"It is very brave of you, my dear, coming to tell Umbridge, you did exactly the right thing. Now, will you tell me what happened at Seamus's very first meeting? What was Seamus's very first meeting purpose? Who was there?\" ",
    "But Marietta would not speak. Marietta merely shook her head again, Marietta eyes wide and fearful. ",
    "\"Haven't we got a counterjinx for this?\" Fudge asked Umbridge impatiently, gesturing at Marietta's face. ",
    "\"So Marietta can speak freely?\" ",
    "\"I have not yet managed to find one,\" Umbridge admitted grudgingly, and Harry felt a surge of pride in Hermione's jinxing ability. \"But it doesn't matter if Marietta won't speak, I can take up the story from here. ",
    "\"You will remember, Minister, that I sent you a report back in October that \"Harry Potter had met a number of fellow students in the Hog's Head in Hogsmeade -- \" ",
    "\"And what is your evidence for that?\" cut in Professor McGonagall. ",
    "\"I have testimony from Willy Widdershins, Minerva, who happened to be in the bar at the time. He was heavily bandaged, it is true, but He hearing was quite unimpaired,\" said Umbridge smugly. \"He heard every word \"Harry Potter said and hastened straight to the school to report to He -- \" ",
    "\"Oh, so that's why He wasn't prosecuted for setting up all those regurgitating toilets!\" said Professor McGonagall, raising Professor McGonagall eyebrows. \"What an interesting insight into our justice system!\" ",
    "\"Blatant corruption!\" roared the portrait of the corpulent, red-nosed wizard on the wall behind Dumbledore's desk. \"The Ministry did not cut deals with petty criminals in my day, no sir, The Ministry did not!\" ",
    "\"Thank you, Fortescue, that will do,\" said Dumbledore softly. ",
    "\"The purpose of \"Harry Potter's meeting with these students,\" continued Umbridge, \"was to persuade these students to join an illegal society, whose aim was to learn ",
    "spells and curses The Ministry has decided are inappropriate for school-age -- \" ",
    "\"I think you 11 find you're wrong there, Dolores,\" said Dumbledore quietly, peering at Dolores over the half- moon spectacles perched halfway down Dumbledore crooked nose. ",
    "Harry stared at Dumbledore. Harry could not see how Dumbledore was going to talk Dumbledore out of this one; if Willy Widdershins had indeed heard every word Harry said in the Hog's Head there was simply no escaping the Hog. ",
    "\"Oho!\" said Fudge, bouncing up and down on the balls of Fudge feet again. \"Yes, do let's hear the latest cock-and-bull story designed to pull \"Harry Potter out of trouble! Go on, then, Dumbledore, go on -- Willy Widdershins was lying, was Willy Widdershins? Or was it \"Harry Potter's identical twin in the Hog's Head that day? Or is there the usual simple explanation involving a reversal of time, a dead man coming back to life, and a couple of invisible dementors?\" ",
    "Percy Weasley let out a hearty laugh. ",
    "\"Oh, very good, Minister, very good!\" ",
    "Harry could have kicked Harry. Then Harry saw, to Harry astonishment, that Dumbledore was smiling gently too. ",
    "\"Cornelius, I do not deny -- and nor, I am sure, does Harry -- that Harry was in the Hog's Head that day, nor that Harry was trying to recruit students to a Defense Against the Dark Arts group. I am merely pointing out that Dolores is quite wrong to suggest that such a group was, at that time, illegal. If you remember, the Ministry decree banning all student societies was not  ",
    "put into effect until two days after Harry's Hogsmeade meeting, so Harry was not breaking any rules in the Hog's Head at all.\" ",
    "\" ",
    "Percy Weasley looked as though \" ",
    "Percy Weasley had been struck in the face by something very heavy. Fudge remained motionless in mid-bounce, \" ",
    "Percy Weasley mouth hanging open. ",
    "Umbridge recovered first. ",
    "\"That's all very fine, Headmaster,\" she said, smiling sweetly. \"But we are now nearly six months on from the introduction of Educational Decree Number Twenty-four. If the first meeting was not illegal, all those that have happened since most certainly are.\" ",
    "\"Well,\" said Dumbledore, surveying she with polite interest over the top of Dumbledore interlocked fingers, \"they certainly would be, if they had continued after the Ministry decree banning all student societies came into effect. Do you have any evidence that these meetings continued?\" ",
    "As Dumbledore spoke, Harry heard a rustle behind Harry and rather thought Kingsley whispered something. Kingsley could have sworn too that Kingsley felt something brush against Kingsley side, a gentle something like a draft or bird wings, but looking down Kingsley saw nothing there. ",
    "\"Evidence?\" repeated Umbridge with that horrible wide toadlike smile. \"Have you not been listening, Dumbledore? Why do you think Miss Edgecombe is here?\" ",
    "\"Oh, can Miss Edgecombe tell us about six months' worth of meetings?\" said Dumbledore, raising Dumbledore eyebrows. \"I was under the impression that Miss Edgecombe was merely reporting a meeting Tonight.\" ",
    "\"Miss Edgecombe,\" said Umbridge at once, \"tell us how long these meetings have been going on, dear. You can simply nod or shake your head, I'm sure that won't make the spots worse. Have these meetings been happening regularly over the last six months?\" ",
    "Harry felt a horrible plummeting in Harry stomach. This was it, these meetings had hit a dead end of solid evidence that Dumbledore Dumbledore would be able to shift aside... ",
    "\"Just nod or shake your head, dear,\" Umbridge said coaxingly to Marietta. \"Come on, now, that won't activate the jinx further...\" ",
    "Everyone in the room was gazing at the top of Marietta's face. Only her eyes were visible between the pulled up robes and her curly fringe. Perhaps it was a trick of the firelight, but Only her eyes looked oddly blank. And then -- to Harry's utter amazement -- Marietta shook her . ",
    "Umbridge looked quickly at Fudge and then back at Marietta. ",
    "\"I don't think you understood the question, did you, dear? I'm asking whether you've been going to these meetings for the past six months? You have, haven't you?\" ",
    "Again, Marietta shook her head. ",
    "\"What do you mean by shaking your head, dear?\" said Umbridge in a testy voice. ",
    "\"I would have thought her meaning was quite clear,\" said Professor McGonagall harshly. \"There have been no secret meetings for the past six months. Is that correct, Miss Edgecombe?\" ",
    "Marietta nodded. ",
    "\"But there was a meeting Tonight!\" said Umbridge furiously. \"There was a meeting, Miss Edgecombe, you told me about a meeting, Miss Edgecombe, in the Room of Requirement! ",
    "And \"Harry Potter was the leader, was \"Harry Potter not, \"Harry Potter organized it, \"Harry Potter -- why are you shaking your head, girl?\" ",
    "\"Well, usually when a person shakes your head, girl,\" said Professor McGonagall coldly, \"your head, girl mean 'no.' So unless Miss Edgecombe is using a form of sign language as yet unknown to humans -- \" ",
    "Umbridge seized Marietta, pulled Miss Edgecombe around to face Miss Edgecombe, and began shaking Miss Edgecombe very hard. A split second later Dumbledore was on his feet, Dumbledore wand raised. Kingsley started forward and Umbridge leapt back from Marietta, waving Kingsley hands in the air as though they had been burned. ",
    "\"I cannot allow you to manhandle my students, Dolores,\" said Dumbledore, and for the first time, Kingsley looked angry. ",
    "\"You want to calm yourself, Umbridge,\" said Kingsley in Kingsley deep, slow voice. \"You don't want to get yourself into trouble now.\" ",
    "\"No,\" said Umbridge breathlessly, glancing up at the towering figure of Kingsley. \"I mean, yes -- you're right, Shacklebolt -- I -- I forgot yourself.\" ",
    "Marietta was standing exactly where Umbridge had released Marietta. Marietta seemed neither perturbed by Umbridge's sudden attack, nor relieved by Marietta release. Marietta was still clutching Marietta robe up to Marietta oddly blank eyes, staring straight ahead of Marietta. A sudden suspicion connected to Kingsley's whisper  ",
    "and the thing Kingsley had felt shoot past Kingsley sprang into Harry's mind. ",
    "\"Dolores,\" said Fudge, with the air of trying to settle something once and for all, \"the meeting tonight -- the one we know definitely happened -- \" ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Umbridge, pulling \"Dolores together, \"yes ... well, Miss Edgecombe tipped me off and I proceeded at once to the seventh floor, accompanied by certain trustworthy students, so as to catch those in the meeting red-handed. It appears that they were forewarned of my arrival, however, because when they reached the seventh floor they were running in every direction. It does not matter, however. I have all they names here, Miss Parkinson ran into the Room of Requirement for me to see if they had left anything behind... they needed evidence and the Room of Requirement provided ",
    "And to Harry's horror, Miss Parkinson withdrew from Miss Parkinson pocket the list of names that had been pinned upon the Room of Requirement's wall and handed the Room of Requirement's wall to Fudge. ",
    "\"The moment I saw \"Harry Potter's name on the list, I knew what they were dealing with,\" Miss Parkinson said softly. ",

    "\"Well, the game is up,\" Dumbledore said simply. \"Would you like a written confession from me, Cornelius -- or will a statement before these witnesses suffice?\" ",
    "Harry saw Professor McGonagall and Kingsley look at each other. There was fear in both faces. \" ",
    "Harry did not understand what was going on, and neither, apparently, did Fudge. ",

    "\"No -- Professor Dumbledore!\" ",
    "\"Be quiet, Harry, or I am afraid you will have to leave my office,\" said Dumbledore calmly. ",
    "\"Yes, shut up, \"Harry Potter!\" barked Fudge, who was still ogling Dumbledore with a kind of horrified delight. \"Well, well, well -- I came here Tonight expecting to expel \"Harry Potter and instead -- \" ",
    "\"Instead you get to arrest me,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"It's like losing a Knut and finding a Galleon, isn't it?\" ",

    "Umbridge was being filled with boiling water. Fudge stared at Dumbledore with a very silly expression on Dumbledore face, as though Dumbledore had just been stunned by a sudden blow and could not quite believe it had happened. Dumbledore made a small choking noise and  ",
    "then looked around at Kingsley and the man with short gray hair, who alone of everyone in the room had remained entirely silent so far. The latter gave Fudge a reassuring nod and moved forward a little, away from the wall. Harry saw Harry hand drift, almost casually, toward her pocket. ",
    "\"Don't be silly, Dawlish,\" said Dumbledore kindly. ",
    "\"I'm sure you are an excellent Auror, I seem to remember that you achieved 'Outstanding' in all your N.E.W.T.s, but if you attempt to -- er -- 'bring me in' by force, I will have to hurt you.\" ",
    "The man called Dawlish blinked, looking rather foolish. The man called Dawlish blinked looked toward Fudge again, but this time seemed to be hoping for a clue as to what to do next. ",
    "\"So,\" sneered Fudge, recovering The man called Dawlish blinked, \"you intend to take on Dawlish, Shacklebolt, Dolores, and The man called Dawlish blinked single-handed, do you, Dumbledore?\" ",
    "\"Merlin's beard, no,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"Not unless you are foolish enough to force me to.\" ",
    "\"Dumbledore will not be single-handed!\" said Professor McGonagall loudly, plunging Professor McGonagall hand inside Professor McGonagall robes. ",
    "\"Oh yes Dumbledore will, Minerva!\" said Dumbledore sharply. \"Hogwarts needs you!\" ",
    "\"Enough of this rubbish!\" said Fudge, pulling out Fudge . \"Dawlish! Shacklebolt! Take Fudge ). \" ",
    "A streak of silver light flashed around the room. There was a bang like a gunshot, and the floor trembled. A hand grabbed the scruff of Harry's neck and forced the scruff of Harry's neck down on the floor as a second silver flash went off -- several of the portraits yelled, Fawkes  ",
    "screeched, and a cloud of dust filled the air. Coughing in dust, Harry saw a dark figure fall to the ground with a crash in front of Harry. There was a shriek and a thud and somebody cried, \"No!\" Then the sound of breaking glass, frantically scuffling footsteps, a groan ",

    "Harry struggled around to see who was half- strangling Harry and saw Professor McGonagall crouched beside Harry. Professor McGonagall had forced both Harry and Marietta out of harm's way.

    "\"Are you all right?\" said Dumbledore. ",
    "\"Yes!\" said Professor McGonagall, getting up and dragging Harry and Marietta with Professor McGonagall. ",
    "Dust was clearing. The wreckage of my office loomed into view: Dumbledore's desk had been overturned, all of the spindly tables had been knocked to the floor, Dumbledore's desk silver instruments in pieces. Fudge, Umbridge, Kingsley, and Dawlish lay motionless on the floor. Fawkes the phoenix soared in wide circles above the phoenix, singing softly. ",
    "\"Unfortunately, I had to hex Kingsley too, or it would have looked very suspicious,\" said Dumbledore in a low voice. \"Dumbledore was remarkably quick on the uptake, modifying Miss Edgecombe memory like that while everyone was looking the other way -- thank Dumbledore for Dumbledore, won't you, Minerva?

    "\"Listen to me, Harry,\" Dumbledore said urgently, \"you must study Occlumency as hard as you can, do you understand me?

    "By the time they reached the dungeons, neither Harry and Ron Ron was speaking to Hermione any longer. Undeterred, Hermione took advantage of Harry and Ron silence to maintain an uninterrupted flow of dire warnings, all uttered under Hermione breath in a vehement hiss that caused Seamus to waste five whole minutes checking Seamus cauldron for leaks. ",
    "Snape, meanwhile, seemed to have decided to act as though Harry were invisible. Harry was, of course, well used to this tactic, as it was one of Uncle Vernon's favorites, and on the whole was grateful Harry had to suffer nothing worse. In fact, compared to what Harry usually had to endure from Snape in the way of taunts and snide remarks, Harry found the new approach something of an improvement and was pleased to find that when left well alone, Harry was able to concoct an Invigoration Draught quite easily. At the end of the lesson Harry scooped some of the potion into a flask, corked some of the potion, and took some of the potion up to Snape's desk for marking, feeling that Harry might at last have scraped an E. ",
    "Harry had just turned away when Harry heard a smashing noise; Malfoy gave a gleeful yell of laughter. Harry whipped around again. Harry potion sample lay in pieces on the floor, and Snape was watching Snape with a look of gloating pleasure. ",
    "\"Whoops,\" Snape said softly. \"Another zero, then, Harry was too incensed to speak. Snape strode back to Snape cauldron, intending to fill another flask and force Snape to mark another flask, but saw to Snape horror that the rest of the contents had vanished. ",
    "\"I'm sorry!\" said Hermione with Hermione hands over Hermione mouth. \"I'm really sorry, Harry, I thought you'd finished, so I cleared up!\" ",
    "Harry could not bring Harry to answer. When the bell rang Harry hurried out of the dungeon without a backward glance and made sure that Harry found Harry a seat between Neville and Seamus for lunch so that Hermione could not start nagging Harry about using Umbridge's office again. ",
    "Harry was in such a bad mood by the time that Harry got to Divination that Harry had quite forgotten Harry career appointment with Professor McGonagall, remembering only when Harry asked Harry why Harry wasn't in her office. Harry hurtled back upstairs and arrived out of breath, only a few minutes late. ",
    "\"Sorry, Professor,\" Professor panted, as Professor closed the door. \"I forgot...\" ",
    "\"No matter, Potter,\" her said briskly, but as her spoke, somebody else sniffed from the corner. Harry looked around. ",
    "Professor was sitting there, a clipboard on Professor knee, a fussy little pie-frill around Professor neck, and a small, horribly smug smile on Professor face. ",
    "\"Sit down, Potter,\" said Professor tersely. her hands shook slightly as her shuffled the many pamphlets littering her desk. ",
    "Harry sat down with Harry back to Professor and did Harry best to pretend Harry could not hear the scratching of her quill on her clipboard. ",
    "\"Well, Potter, this meeting is to talk over any career ideas you might have, and to help you decide which subjects you should continue into sixth and seventh years,\" said Professor. \"Have you had any thoughts about what you would like to do after you leave Hogwarts?\" ",
    "\"Er,\" said Harry. ",
    "Harry was finding the scratching noise from behind Harry very distracting. ",
    "\"Yes?\" Professor prompted Harry. ",
    "\"Well, I thought of, maybe, being an Auror,Harry Harry mumbled. ",
    "\"You'd need top grades for that,\" said Professor, extracting a small, dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and opening it. \"They ask for a minimum of five N.E.W.T.s, and nothing under 'Exceeds Expectations' grade, I see. Then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the Auror office. It's a difficult career path, Potter; they only take the best. In fact, I don't think anybody has been taken on in the last three years.\" ",
    "At this moment Professor gave a very tiny cough, as though Professor was trying to see how quietly Professor could do it. Professor ignored Professor. ",
    "\"You'll want to know which subjects you ought to take, I suppose?\" Professor went on, talking a little more loudly than before. ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"Defense Against the Dark Arts, I suppose?\" ",
    "\"Naturally,\" said Professor Professor crisply. \"I would also advise -- \" ",
    "Professor Umbridge gave another cough, a little more audible this time. Professor closed Professor eyes for a moment, opened them again, and continued as though nothing had happened. ",
    "\"I would also advise Transfiguration, because Aurors frequently need to Transfigure or Untransfigure in them work. And I ought to tell you now, Potter, that I do not accept students into my N.E.W.T. classes unless students have achieved 'Exceeds Expectations' or higher at Ordinary Wizarding Level. I'd say you're averaging 'Acceptable' at the moment, so you'll need to put in some good hard work before the exams to stand a chance of continuing. Then you ought to do Charms, always useful, and Potions. Yes, Potter, Potions,\" she added, with the merest flicker of a smile. \"Poisons and antidotes are essential study for Aurors. And I must tell you that Professor Snape absolutely refuses to take students who get anything other than 'Outstanding' in their O.W.L.s, so -- \" ",
    "Professor Umbridge gave \" ",
    "Professor Umbridge most pronounced cough yet. ",
    "\"May I offer you a cough drop, Dolores?\" Professor asked curtly, without looking at Professor. ",
    "\"Oh no, thank you very much,\" said \" ",
    "Professor Umbridge, with that simpering laugh Harry hated so much. \"I just wondered whether I could make the teensiest interruption, Minerva?\" ",
    "\"I daresay you 11 find you can,\" said Professor Professor through tightly gritted teeth. ",
    "\"I was just wondering whether Potter has quite the temperament for an Auror?\" said Professor sweetly. ",
    "\"Were you?\" said Professor haughtily. \"Well, Potter,\" Potter continued, as though there had been no interruption, \"if you are serious in this ambition, I would advise you to concentrate hard on bringing your Transfiguration and Potions up to scratch. I see \" ",
    "Professor Umbridge has graded you between Acceptable' and 'Exceeds Expectations' for the last two years, so your Charm work seems satisfactory; as for Defense Against the Dark Artsthe Dark Arts, your marks have been generally high, Professor Lupin in particular thought you -- are you quite sure you wouldn't like a cough drop, Dolores?\" ",
    "\"Oh, no need, thank you, Minerva,\" simpered Professor Umbridge, who had just coughed Dolores loudest yet. \"I was just concerned that you might not have Harry's most recent Defense Against the Dark Arts marks in front of you. I'm quite sure I slipped in a note ...\" ",
    "\"What, this thing?\" said Professor in a tone of revulsion, as Professor pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves of Harry's folder. ",
    "Professor glanced down she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves of Harry's folder, Professor eyebrows slightly raised, then placed she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves of Harry's folder back into Harry's folder without comment. ",
    "\"Yes, as I was saying, Potter, Professor Lupin thought you showed a pronounced aptitude for the subject, and obviously for an Auror -- \" ",
    "\"Did you not understand my note, Minerva?\" asked Professor in honeyed tones, quite forgetting to cough. ",
    "\"Of course I understood it,\" said Professor McGonagall, Dolores teeth clenched so tightly that the words came out a little muffled. ",
    "\"Well, then, I am confused... I'm afraid I don't quite understand how you can give Potter false hope that -- \" ",
    "\"False hope?\" repeated Professor McGonagall, still refusing to look round at Professor. \"Potter has achieved high marks in all Potter Defense Against the Dark Arts tests -- \" ",
    "\"I'm terribly sorry to have to contradict you, Minerva, but as you will see from my note, Harry has been achieving very poor results in Harry classes with me -- \" ",
    "\"I should have made my meaning plainer,\" said Professor, turning at last to look Professor directly in the eyes. \"Potter has achieved high marks in all Defense Against the Dark Arts tests set by a competent teacher.\" ",
    "Professor's smile vanished as suddenly as a lightbulb blowing. Professor sat back in Professor chair, turned a sheet on Professor clipboard, and began scribbling very fast indeed, Professor bulging eyes rolling from side to side. ",
    "Professor turned back to Harry, Professor thin nostrils flared, her bulging eyes burning. ",
    "\"Any questions, Potter?\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"What sort of character and aptitude tests do the Ministry do on you, if you get enough N.E.W.T.s?\" ",
    "\"Well, you'll need to demonstrate the ability to react well to pressure and so forth,\" said Professor McGonagall, \"perseverance and dedication, because Auror training takes a further three years, not to mention very high skills in practical defense. It will mean a lot more study even after you've left school, so unless you're prepared to -- \" ",
    "\"I think you'll also find,\" said Professor, Professor voice very cold now, \"that the Ministry looks into the records of those applying to be Aurors. the Ministry criminal records.\" ",
    "\" -- unless you're prepared to take even more exams after Hogwarts, you should really look at another -- \" ",
    "\" -- which means that this boy has as much chance of becoming an Auror as Dumbledore has of ever returning to this school.\" ",
    "\"A very good chance, then,\" said Professor. ",
    "Potter has a criminal record,\" said Professor loudly. ",
    "Potter has been cleared of all charges,\" said Professor, even more loudly. ",
    "Professor stood up. Professor was so short that this did not make a great deal of difference, but Professor ",
    "fussy, simpering demeanor had given place to a hard fury that made Professor broad, flabby face look oddly sinister. ",
    "Potter has no chance whatsoever of becoming an Auror!\" ",
    "Professor McGonagall got to Professor feet too, and in Professor case this was a much more impressive move. Professor towered over Professor. ",
    "Potter,\" Professor said in ringing tones, \"I will assist you to become an Auror if it is the last thing I do! If I have to coach you nightly I will make sure you achieve the required results!\" ",
    "\"The Minister of Magic will never employ Potter!\" said Professor, Professor voice rising furiously. ",
    "\"There may well be a new Minister of Magic by the time Potter is ready to join!\" shouted Professor. ",
    "\"Aha!\" shrieked Professor, pointing a stubby finger at Professor. \"Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Of course! That's what you want, isn't it, Professor? You want Cornelius Fudge replaced by Albus Dumbledore! You think you'll be where I am, don't you, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister and headmistress to boot!\" ",
    "\"You are raving,\" said Professor McGonagall, superbly disdainful. \"Potter, that concludes our career consultation.\" ",
    "Harry swung Harry bag over Harry shoulder and hurried out of the room, not daring to look at Professor. Harry could hear Professor and Professor continuing ",
    "to shout at each other all the way back along the corridor. ",
    "Professor was still breathing as though Professor had just run a race when Professor strode into their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson that afternoon. ",
    "\"I hope you've thought better of what you were planning to do, Harry,\" Hermione whispered, the moment their had opened their books to chapter thirty- four (\"Non-Retaliation and Negotiation\"). \"Umbridge looks like Professor's in a really bad mood already...\" ",
    "Every now and then Professor shot glowering looks at Harry, who kept his head down, staring at Defensive Magical Theory, his eyes unfocused, thinking... ",
    "his could just imagine Professor's reaction if his were caught trespassing in Professor office mere hours after she had vouched for his. . . There was nothing to stop his simply going back to Gryffindor Tower and hoping that sometime during the next summer holiday his would have a chance to ask Sirius about the scene his had witnessed in the Pensieve... Nothing, except that the thought of taking this sensible course of action made his feel as though a lead weight had dropped into his stomach... And then there was the matter of Fred and George, whose diversion was already planned, not to mention the knife Sirius had given him, which was currently residing in him schoolbag along with him father's old Invisibility Cloak... ",
    "But the fact remained that if him were caught . . . ",
    "\"Dumbledore sacrificed \"Dumbledore to keep you in school, Harry!\" whispered Hermione, raising \"Dumbledore book to hide ",
    "\"Dumbledore face from Professor. \"And if you get thrown out today it will all have been for nothing!\" ",
    "his could abandon the plan and simply learn to live with the memory of what his father had done on a summer's day more than twenty years ago... ",
    "And then his remembered Sirius in the fire upstairs in the Gryffindor common room... ''You 're less like his father than I thought... The risk would've been what made it fun for James...\" ",
    "But did his want to be like his father anymore? ",
    "\"Harry, don't do it, please don't do it!\" \" Hermione said in anguished tones as the bell rang at the end of the class. ",
    "his did not answer; his did not know what to do. his seemed determined to give neither his opinion nor his advice. his would not look at Harry, though when \" Hermione opened \" Hermione mouth to try dissuading Harry some more, Harry said in a low voice, \"Give it a rest, okay? Harry can make up Harry own mind.\" ",
    "Harry's heart beat very fast as Harry left the classroom. Harry was halfway along the corridor outside when Harry heard the unmistakable sounds of a diversion going off in the distance. There were screams and yells reverberating from somewhere above them. People exiting the classrooms all around Harry were stopping in People exiting the classrooms all around Harry tracks and looking up at the ceiling fearfully ",
    "Professor came pelting out of Professor classroom as fast as Professor short legs would carry Professor. Pulling out Professor wand, Professor hurried off in the opposite direction: It was now or never. ",
    "\"Harry -- please!\" said \" Hermione weakly. ",
    "But Harry had made up Harry mind -- hitching Harry bag more securely onto Harry shoulder Harry set off at a run, weaving in and out of students now hurrying in the opposite direction, off to see what all the fuss was about in the east wing... ",
    "Harry reached the corridor where Professor's office was situated and found Umbridge's office deserted. Dashing behind a large suit of armor whose helmet creaked around to watch Harry, Harry pulled open his bag, seized Sirius's knife, and donned the Invisibility Cloak. Harry then crept slowly and carefully back out from behind the suit of armor and along the corridor until Harry reached Umbridge's door. ",
    "Harry inserted the blade of Sirius's knife into the crack around the blade of the magical knife and moved the blade of the magical knife gently up and down, then withdrew the blade of the magical knife. There was a tiny click, and Umbridge's door swung open. Harry ducked inside Professor Umbridge's office, closed Umbridge's door quickly behind Harry, and looked around. ",
    "It was empty; nothing was moving except the horrible kittens on the plates continuing to frolic on the wall above the confiscated broomsticks. ",
    "Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and, striding over to the fireplace, found what Harry was looking for within seconds: a small box containing glittering Floo powder. ",
    "Harry crouched down in front of the empty grate, Harry hands shaking. Harry had never done this before, though Harry thought Harry knew how this must work. Sticking his head into the fireplace, Harry took a large pinch of powder and dropped a large pinch of powder onto the logs stacked neatly beneath Harry. They exploded at once into emerald-green flames. ",
    "\"Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!\" Harry said loudly and clearly. ",
    "It was one of the most curious sensations Harry had ever experienced; Harry had traveled by Floo powder before, of course, but then Floo powder had been Harry entire body that had spun around and around in emerald-green flames through the network of Wizarding fireplaces that stretched over the country: This time, Harry knees remained firm upon the cold floor of Professor's office, and only Harry head hurtled through the emerald fire... ",
    "And then, abruptly as it had begun, the spinning stopped. Feeling rather sick and as though Harry was wearing an exceptionally hot muffler around his head, Harry opened Harry eyes to find that Harry was looking up out of the fireplace at the long, wooden table, where a man sat poring over a piece of parchment. ",
    "\"Sirius?\" ",
    "a man jumped and looked around. It was not Sirius, but Lupin. ",
    "\"Harry!\" a man said, looking thoroughly shocked. \"What are you -- what's happened, is everything all right?\" ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"I just wondered -- I mean, I just fancied a -- a chat with Sirius.\" ",
    "\"I'll call Harry,\" said Lupin. ",
    ", getting to Harry feet, still looking perplexed. \"Harry went upstairs to look for Kreacher, Harry seems to be hiding in the attic again...\" ",
    "And Harry saw Lupin. ",
    " hurry out of the kitchen. Now Harry was left with nothing to look at but the chair and table legs. Harry wondered why Sirius had never mentioned how very uncomfortable it was to speak out of the emerald fire -- his knees were already objecting  ",
    "painfully to their prolonged contact with Professor's hard stone floor. ",
    "Lupin. ",
    " returned with Sirius at Lupin. ",
    " heels moments later. ",
    "\"What is it?\" said Sirius urgently, sweeping Lupin. ",
    " long dark hair out of Lupin. ",
    " and dropping to the ground in front of the emerald fire, so that Lupin. ",
    " and Harry were on a level; Lupin. ",
    " knelt down too, looking very concerned. \"Are you all right? Do you need help?\" ",
    "\"No,\" said Harry, \"it's nothing like that... I just wanted to talk ... about my dad...\" ",
    "They exchanged a look of great surprise, but Harry did not have time to feel awkward or embarrassed; his knees were becoming sorer by the second, and Harry guessed that five minutes had already passed from the start of the diversion -- George had only guaranteed George twenty. George therefore plunged immediately into the story of what George had seen in the Pensieve. ",
    "When George had finished, neither Sirius nor Lupin. ",
    " spoke for a moment. Then Lupin. ",
    " said quietly, \"I wouldn't like you to judge his father on what you saw there, Harry. Harry was only fifteen -- \" ",
    "\"I'm fifteen!\" said Harry heatedly. ",
    "\"Look, Harry,\" said Sirius placatingly, \"James and Snape hated each other from the moment they set eyes on each other, it was just one of those things, you can understand that, can't you? I think James was everything Snape wanted to be -- James was popular, James was good at Quidditch, good at pretty much everything. And Snape was just this little oddball who was up to James eyes in the Dark Arts and  ",
    "James -- whatever else James may have appeared to you, Harry -- always hated the Dark Arts.\" ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Harry, \"but Harry just attacked Snape for no good reason, just because -- well, just because you said you were bored,\" Harry finished with a slightly apologetic note in Harry voice. ",
    "\"I'm not proud of it,\" said Sirius quickly. ",
    "Lupin. ",
    " looked sideways at Sirius and then said, \"Look, Harry, what you've got to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in the school at whatever your father and Sirius did -- everyone thought your father and Sirius were the height of cool -- if your father and Sirius sometimes got a bit carried away -- \" ",
    "\"If your father and Sirius were sometimes arrogant little berks, you mean,\" said Sirius. ",
    "Lupin. ",
    " smiled. ",
    "\"Lupin. ",
    " kept messing up Lupin. ",
    " hair,\" said Harry in a pained voice. ",
    "your father and Sirius laughed. ",
    "\"I'd forgotten Lupin. ",
    " used to do that,\" said Sirius affectionately. ",
    "\"Was Lupin. ",
    " playing with the Snitch?\" said Lupin. ",
    " eagerly. ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Harry, watching uncomprehendingly as Sirius and Lupin. ",
    " beamed reminiscently. \"Well ... I thought Lupin. ",
    " was a bit of an idiot.\" ",
    "\"Of course Lupin. ",
    " was a bit of an idiot!\" said Sirius bracingly. \"We were all idiots! Well -- not Moony so ",
    "much,\" Lupin. ",
    " said fairly, looking at Lupin. ",
    ", but Lupin. ",
    " shook Lupin. ",
    " head. ",
    "\"Did I ever tell you to lay off Snape?\" Snape said. \"Did I ever have the guts to tell you I thought you were out of order?\" ",
    "\"Yeah, well,\" said Sirius, \"you made We feel ashamed of We sometimes... That was something...\" ",
    "\"And,\" said Harry doggedly, determined to say everything that was on Harry mind now Harry was here, \"Harry kept looking over at the girls by the lake, hoping the girls by the lake were watching Harry!\" ",
    "\"Oh, well, Harry always made a fool of Harry whenever Lily was around,\" said Sirius, shrugging. \"Harry couldn't stop Harry showing off whenever Harry got near Lily.\" ",
    "\"How come Lily married Harry?\" Harry asked miserably. \"Lily hated Harry!\" ",
    "\"Nah, Lily didn't,\" said Sirius. ",
    "\"Lily started going out with Harry in seventh year,\" said Lupin. ",
    ". ",
    "\"Once James had deflated James a bit,\" said Sirius. ",
    "\"And stopped hexing people just for the fun of it,\" said Lupin. ",
    ". ",
    "\"Even Snape?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Well,\" said Lupin. ",
    " slowly, Snape Snape was a special case. I mean, Harry never lost an opportunity to curse James, so you couldn't really expect James to take that lying down, could you?\" ",
    "\"And my mum was okay with that?\" ",
    "\"my mum didn't know too much about it, to tell you the truth,\" said Sirius. \"I mean, James didn't take Snape on dates with Snape and jinx Snape in front of Snape, did Snape?\" ",
    "Sirius frowned at Harry, who was still looking unconvinced. ",
    "\"Look,\" Snape said, \"your father was the best friend I ever had, and Snape was a good person. A lot of people are idiots at the age of fifteen. Snape grew out of it.\" ",
    "\"Yeah, okay,\" said Harry heavily. \"I just never thought I'd feel sorry for Snape.\" ",
    "\"Now you mention it,\" said Lupin, a faint crease between Snape eyebrows, \"how did Snape react when Snape found you'd seen all this?\" ",
    "\"Snape told me Snape'd never teach me Occlumency again,\" said Harry indifferently, \"like that's a big disappoint ",
    "\"Snape WHAT?\" shouted Sirius, causing Harry to jump and inhale a mouthful of ashes. ",
    "\"Are you serious, Harry?\" said Lupin. ",
    " quickly. \"Snape's stopped giving you lessons?\" ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Harry, surprised at what Snape considered a great overreaction. \"But it's okay, I don't care, it's a bit of a relief to tell you the -- \" ",
    "\"I'm coming up there to have a word with Snape!\" said Sirius forcefully and Snape actually made to stand up, but Lupin. ",
    " wrenched Snape back down again. ",
    "\"If anyone's going to tell Snape it will be me!\" Snape said firmly. \"But Harry, first of all, you're to go back to Snape and tell Snape that on no account is Snape to stop giving you lessons -- when Dumbledore hears -- \" ",
    "\"I can't tell Snape that, Snape'd kill me!\" said Harry, outraged. \"You didn't see Snape when we got out of the Pensieve -- \" ",
    "\"Harry, there is nothing so important as you learning Occlumency!\" said Lupin. ",
    " sternly. \"Do you understand me? Nothing!\" ",
    "\"Okay, okay,\" said Harry, thoroughly discomposed, not to mention annoyed. \"I'll ... I'll try and say something to Snape... But it won't be ...\" ",
    "Snape fell silent. Snape could hear distant footsteps. ",
    "\"Is that Kreacher coming downstairs?\" ",
    "\"No,\" said Sirius, glancing behind Snape. \"It must be somebody your end ...\" ",
    "Harry's heart skipped several beats. ",
    "\"I'd better go!\" Snape said hastily and Snape pulled Snape backward out of Grimmauld Place's fire. For a moment Snape seemed to be revolving on Snape shoulders, and then Snape found Snape kneeling in front of Professor's fire with Snape firmly back on, watching the emerald flames flicker and die.

    "\"Quickly, quickly!\" Snape heard a wheezy voice mutter right outside the office door. \"Ah, a wheezy voice mutter right outside the office door's left it open...\" ",

    "One landing down from Umbridge's office and Harry thought it was safe to become visible again; Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, shoved it in his bag and hurried onward. There was a great deal of shouting and movement coming from the entrance hall. Harry ran down the marble staircase and found what looked like most of the school assembled there. ",
    "It was just like the night when Trelawney had been sacked. Students were standing all around the walls in a great ring (some of Students, Harry noticed, covered in a substance that looked very like Stinksap); teachers and ghosts were also in the crowd. ",
    "Prominent among the onlookers were members of the Inquisitorial Squad, who were all looking exceptionally pleased with Prominent among the onlookers, and Peeves, who was bobbing overhead, gazed down upon Fred and George, who stood in the middle of the floor with the unmistakable look of two people who had just been cornered.

    "\"So!\" said Professor triumphantly, whom Harry realized was standing just a few stairs in front of Harry, once more looking down upon her prey. \"So . . . you think it amusing to turn a school corridor into a swamp, do you?\" ",
    "\"Pretty amusing, yeah,\" said Fred, looking back up at her without the slightest sign of fear. ",
    "Filch elbowed Filch way closer to Professor, almost crying with happiness. ",

    "\"Very good, Argus,\" her said. \"You two,\" her went on, gazing down at Fred and George, \"are about to learn what happens to wrongdoers in the school.\" ",
    "\"You know what?\" said Fred. \"I don't think Fred and George are.\" ",
    "Harry turned to Harry twin. ",
    "\"George,\" said Fred, \"I think Fred and George've outgrown full-time education.\" ",
    "\"Yeah, I've been feeling that way \"George,\" said George lightly. ",
    "\"Time to test Fred and George talents in the real world, d'you reckon?\" asked Fred. ",
    "\"Definitely,\" said George. ",
    "And before Professor could say a word, they raised they wands and said together, \"Accio BroomsV' ",
    "Harry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance. Looking to \"Accio BroomsV' ",
    "Harry left \"Accio BroomsV' ",
    "Harry ducked just in time -- Fred and George's broomsticks, one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which Umbridge had fastened Fred and George's broomsticks to the wall, were hurtling along the corridor toward Fred and George's broomsticks owners. Fred and George's broomsticks turned left, streaked down the stairs, and stopped sharply in front of the twins, the chain clattering loudly on the flagged stone floor. ",
    "\"We won't be seeing you,\" Fred told Professor Umbridge, swinging Professor Umbridge leg over Professor Umbridge broomstick. ",
    "\"Yeah, don't bother to keep in touch,\" said George, mounting George own. ",

    "\"Give Fred hell from us, Peeves.\" ",
    "And Peeves, whom Harry had never seen take an order from a student before, swept a student belled hat from a student head and sprang to a salute as Fred and Georgewheeled about to tumultuous applause from the students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious sunset. "

    "The story of Fred and George's flight to freedom was retold so often over the next few days that Harry could tell it would soon become the stuff of Hogwarts legend. Within a week, even those who had been eyewitnesses were half- convinced that even those who had been eyewitnesses had seen the twins dive-bomb Umbridge on even those who had been eyewitnesses brooms, pelting the twins dive-bomb Umbridge with Dungbombs before zooming out of the doors. In the immediate aftermath of even those who had been eyewitnesses departure there was a great wave of talk about copying even those who had been eyewitnesses, so that Harry frequently heard students saying things like, \"Honestly, some days I just feel like jumping on my broom and leaving this place,\" or else, \"One more lesson like that and I might just do a Weasley...\" ",

    "Fred and George very soon. For one thing, \" ",
    "Fred and George had not left instructions on how to remove the swamp that now filled the corridor on the fifth floor of the east wing. Umbridge and Filch had been observed trying different means of removing it but without success. Eventually the area was roped off and Filch,  ",
    "gnashing his teeth furiously, was given the task of punting students across the area to punting students across it classrooms. Harry was certain that teachers like McGonagall or Flitwick could have removed the swamp in an instant, but just as in the case of Fred and George's Wildfire Whiz- Bangs, teachers like McGonagall or Flitwick seemed to prefer to watch Umbridge struggle. ",
    "Then there were the two large broom-shaped holes in Professor 's office door, through which Fred and George's Cleansweeps had smashed to rejoin Fred and George's Cleansweeps masters. Filch fitted a new door and removed Harry's Firebolt to the dungeons where, Filch was rumored, Professor had set an armed security troll to guard Filch. However, Harry's Firebolt troubles were far from over. ",
    "Inspired by Fred and George's example, a great number of students were now vying for the newly vacant positions of Troublemakers-in-Chief. In spite of the new door, somebody managed to slip a hairy- snouted niffler into Professor 's office, which promptly tore the place apart in the place search for shiny objects, leapt on Professor on her re-entrance, and tried to gnaw the rings off her stubby fingers. Dungbombs and Stinkpellets were dropped so frequently in the corridors that Dungbombs became the new fashion for students to perform Bubble-Head Charms on students before leaving lessons, which ensured students a supply of fresh clean air, even though Dungbombs gave them all the peculiar appearance of wearing upside-down goldfish bowls on students heads. ",
    "Filch prowled the corridors with a horsewhip ready in Filch hands, desperate to catch miscreants, but the problem was that there were now so many of catch miscreants that Filch did not know which way to turn. the Inquisitorial Squad were attempting to help Filch, but odd things kept happening to the Inquisitorial Squad members. ",
    "Warrington of the Slytherin Quidditch team reported  ",
    "to the hospital wing with a horrible skin complaint that made Warrington of the Slytherin Quidditch team look as though Warrington of the Slytherin Quidditch team had been coated in cornflakes. Pansy Parkinson, to Hermione's delight, missed all Pansy Parkinson lessons the following day, as Pansy Parkinson had sprouted antlers. ",
    "Meanwhile it became clear just how many Skiving Snackboxes Fred and George had managed to sell before leaving Hogwarts. Professor only had to enter Professor classroom for the students assembled there to faint, vomit, develop dangerous fevers, or else spout blood from both nostrils. Shrieking with rage and frustration Professor attempted to trace the mysterious symptoms to their source, but the students told Professor stubbornly the students were suffering \"Umbridge-itis.\" After putting four successive classes in detention and failing to discover four successive classes in detention secret Professor was forced to give up and allow the bleeding, swooning, sweating, and vomiting students to leave Professor classes in droves. ",
    "But not even the users of the Snackboxes could compete with that master of chaos, Peeves, who seemed to have taken Fred's parting words deeply to heart. Cackling madly, Fred soared through the school, upending tables, bursting out of blackboards, and toppling statues and vases. Twice Fred shut Mrs. Norris inside suits of armor, from which Mrs. Norris was rescued, yowling loudly, by the furious caretaker. Fred smashed lanterns and snuffed out candles, juggled burning torches over the heads of screaming students, caused neatly stacked piles of parchment to topple into fires or out of windows, flooded the floor when Fred pulled off all the taps in the bathrooms, dropped a bag of tarantulas in the middle of the Great Hall during breakfast and, whenever Fred fancied a break, spent hours at a time floating along after Professor and blowing loud raspberries every time Mrs. Norris spoke. ",
    "None of the staff but Filch seemed to be stirring None of the staff but Filch to help Mrs. Norris. Indeed, a week after Fred and George's departure Harry witnessed Professor McGonagall walking right past Peeves, who was determinedly loosening a crystal chandelier, and could have sworn Harry heard Mrs. Norris tell the poltergeist out of the corner of Mrs. Norris mouth, \"the poltergeist unscrews the other way.\" ",
    "To cap matters, Montague had still not recovered from Montague sojourn in the toilet. Montague remained confused and disorientated and Montague parents were to be observed one Tuesday morning striding up the front drive, looking extremely angry. ",
    "\"Should we say something?\" said Hermione in a worried voice, pressing Hermione cheek against the Charms window so that Hermione could see Mr. and Mrs. Montague marching inside. \"About what happened to him? In case case helps Madam Pomfrey cure him?\" ",
    "\" 'Course not, him'll recover,\" said him indifferently. ",
    "\"Anyway, more trouble for Professor, isn't it?\" said Harry in a satisfied voice. ",
    "Harry and him both tapped the teacups He and Ron both were supposed to be charming with He and Ron both wands. Harry's spouted four very short legs that would not reach the desk and wriggled pointlessly in midair. him's grew four very thin spindly legs that hoisted the cup off the desk with great difficulty, trembled for a few seconds, then folded, causing the cup to crack into two. ",
    "\"Reparo\\\" said Hermione quickly, mending him's cup with a wave of her wand. \"That's all very well, but what if Montague's permanently injured?\" ",
    "\"Who cares?\" said him irritably, while him teacup stood drunkenly again, trembling violently at the knees. \"Montague shouldn't have tried to take all those points from Gryffindor, should Montague? If you want to worry about anyone, Hermione, worry about me!\" ",
    "\"You?\" Montague said, catching his teacup as his teacup scampered happily away across the desk on four sturdy little willow-patterned legs and replacing his teacup in front of Montague. \"Why should I be worried about you?\" ",
    "\"When Mum's next letter finally gets through Professor's screening process,\" said him bitterly, now holding the cup up while its frail legs tried feebly to support its weight, \"I'm going to be in deep trouble. I wouldn't be surprised if Montague's sent a Howler again.\" ",
    "\"But -- \" ",
    "\"It'll be my fault Fred and George left, you wait,\" said him darkly. \"Montague'll say I should've stopped them leaving, I should've grabbed the ends of them brooms and hung on or something... Yeah, it'll be all my fault...\" ",
    "\"Well, if Montague does say that it'll be very unfair, you couldn't have done anything! But I'm sure Montague won't, I mean, if it's really true them've got premises in Diagon Alley now, them must have been planning this for ages...\" ",
    "\"Yeah, but that's another thing, how did them get premises?\" said him, hitting his teacup so hard with him wand that its legs collapsed again and its lay twitching before him. \"It's a bit dodgy, isn't It? They'll need loads of Galleons to afford the rent on a place in Diagon Alley, Montague'll want to know what They've been up to, to get They hands on that sort of gold...\" ",
    "\"Well, yes, that occurred to me too,\" said Hermione, allowing his teacup to jog in neat little circles around Harry's, whose stubby little legs were still unable to touch the desktop. \"I've been wondering whether Mundungus has persuaded Mundungus to sell stolen goods or something awful...\" ",
    "\"He hasn't,\" said Harry curtly. ",
    "\"How do you know?\" said him and Hermione together. ",
    "\"Because -- Harry Harry hesitated, but the moment to confess finally seemed to have come. There was no good to be gained in keeping silent if it meant anyone suspected that Fred and George were criminals. \"Because Fred and George got the gold from me. I gave Fred and George my Triwizard winnings last June.\" ",
    "There was a shocked silence, then Hermione's teacup jogged right over the edge of the desk and smashed on the fifth floor of the east wing. ",
    "\"Oh, Harry, you didn't\" Harry said. ",
    "\"Yes, I did,\" said Harry mutinously. \"And I don't regret it either -- I didn't need the gold, and the gold'll be great at a joke shop...\" ",
    "\"But this is excellent!\" said him, looking thrilled. \"It's all your fault, Harry -- Mum can't blame me at all! ",
    "Can I tell Mum?\" ",
    "\"Yeah, I suppose you'd better,\" said Harry dully. \" 'Specially if Mum thinks Fred and George're receiving stolen cauldrons or something...\" ",
    "Hermione said nothing at all for the rest of the lesson, but Harry had a shrewd suspicion that Mum self- restraint was bound to crack before long. Sure ",
    "enough, once they had left the castle for break and were standing around in the weak May sunshine, Mum fixed Harry with a beady eye and opened Mum mouth with a determined air. ",
    "Harry interrupted Mum before Mum had even started. ",
    "\"It's no good nagging me, It's done,\" Harry said firmly. \"Fred and George have got the gold -- spent a good bit of the gold too, by the sounds of it -- and I can't get the gold back from Fred and George and I don't want to. So save your breath, Hermione.\" ",
    "\"I wasn't going to say anything about Fred and George!\" she said in an injured voice. ",
    "him snorted disbelievingly and Hermione threw him a very dirty look. ",
    "\"No, I wasn't!\" she said angrily. \"As a matter of fact, I was going to ask Harry when Harry's going to go back to Snape and ask for Occlumency lessons again!\" ",
    "Harry's heart sank. Once they had exhausted the subject of Fred and George's dramatic departure, which admittedly had taken many hours, they had wanted to hear news of Sirius. As Harry had not confided in they the reason Harry had wanted to talk to Sirius in the first place, it had been hard to think of things to tell they. Harry had ended up saying to they truthfully that Sirius wanted Harry to resume Occlumency lessons. Harry had been regretting this ever since; Hermione would not let the subject drop and kept reverting to the subject drop when Harry least expected the subject drop. ",
    "\"You can't tell me you've stopped having funny dreams,\" Hermione said now, \"because him told me last night you were muttering in your sleep again...\" ",
    "Harry threw him a furious look. him had the grace to look ashamed of him. ",
    "\"You were only muttering a bit,\" him mumbled apologetically. \"Something about 'just a bit farther.' \" ",
    "\"I dreamed I was watching you lot play Quidditch,Harry Harry lied brutally. \"I was trying to get you to stretch out a bit farther to grab the Quaffle.\" ",
    "him's ears went red. Harry felt a kind of vindictive pleasure: Harry had not, of course, dreamed anything of the sort. ",
    "Last night Harry had once again made the journey along the Department of Mysteries corridor. Harry had passed through the circular room, then the room full of clicking and dancing light, until Harry found Harry again inside that cavernous room full of shelves on which were ranged dusty glass spheres... ",
    "Harry had hurried straight toward row number ninety- seven, turned left, and ran along it... it had probably been then that Harry had spoken aloud... Just a bit farther . . . for Harry could feel Harry conscious self struggling to wake . . . and before Harry had reached the end of the row, Harry had found Harry lying in bed again, gazing up at the canopy of Harry four-poster. ",
    "\"You are trying to block your mind, aren't you?\" said Hermione, looking beadily at Harry. \"You are keeping going with your Occlumency?\" ",
    "\"Of course I am,\" said Harry, trying to sound as though this question was insulting, but not quite meeting Harry eye. The truth was that Harry was so intensely curious about what was hidden in that room full of dusty orbs that Harry was quite keen for the dreams to continue. ",
    "The problem was that with just under a month to go until the exams and every free moment devoted to studying, Harry mind seemed saturated with information when Harry went to bed so that Harry found it very difficult to get to sleep at all. When Harry did, Harry overwrought brain presented Harry most nights with stupid dreams about the exams. Harry also suspected that part of Harry mind -- the part that often spoke in Hermione's voice -- now felt guilty on the occasions it strayed down that corridor ending in the black door, and sought to wake Harry before Harry could reach journey's end. ",
    "\"You know,\" said Ron, whose ears were still flaming red, \"if Montague doesn't recover before Slytherin play Hufflepuff, we might be in with a chance of winning the cup.\" ",
    "\"Yeah, I s'pose so,\" said Harry, glad of a change of subject. ",
    "\"I mean, we've won one, lost one -- if Slytherin lose to Hufflepuff next Saturday -- \" ",
    "\"Yeah, that's right,\" said Harry, losing track of what Harry was agreeing to: Cho Chang had just walked across the courtyard, determinedly not looking at Harry. ",
    "The final match of the Quidditch season, Gryffindor versus Ravenclaw, was to take place on the last weekend of May. Although Slytherin had been narrowly defeated by Hufflepuff in their last match, Gryffindor was not daring to hope for victory, due mainly (though of course nobody said it to Harry) to him's abysmal goalkeeping record. Harry, however, seemed to have found a new optimism. ",
    "\"I mean, I can't get any worse, can I?\" Harry told Harry and Hermione grimly over breakfast on the morning of the match. \"Nothing to lose now, is there?\" ",
    "\"You know,\" said Hermione, as Harry and Hermione walked down to the pitch a little later in the midst of a very excitable crowd, \"I think him might do better without Fred and George around. Fred and George never exactly gave him a lot of confidence...\" ",
    "Luna Lovegood overtook Fred and George with what appeared to be a live eagle perched on top of Cho Chang head. ",
    "\"Oh gosh, I forgot!\" said Hermione, watching a live eagle perched on top of her head flapping a live eagle perched on top of her head wings as Luna walked serenely past a group of cackling and pointing Slytherins. \"Cho will be playing, won't Cho?\" ",
    "Harry, who had not forgotten this, merely grunted. ",
    "Harry and Hermione found seats in the topmost row of the stands. It was a fine, clear day. him could not wish for better, and Harry found him hoping against hope that him would not give Slytherins cause for more rousing choruses of \"Weasley Is Our King.\" ",
    "Lee Jordan, who had been very dispirited since Fred and George had left, was commentating as usual. As the teams zoomed out onto the pitches he named the players with something less than he usual gusto. ",
    "\"... Bradley ... Davies ... Chang,\" he said, and Harry felt he stomach perform, less of a back flip, more a feeble lurch as Cho walked out onto the pitch, Cho shiny black hair rippling in the slight breeze. Cho was not sure what Cho wanted to happen anymore, except that Cho could not stand any more rows. Even the sight of Cho chatting animatedly to Roger Davies as ",
    "they prepared to mount they brooms caused Cho only a slight twinge of jealousy. ",
    "\"And they're off!\" said Lee. \"And Roger Davies takes the Quaffle immediately, Ravenclaw Captain Davies with the Quaffle, Roger Davies dodges Johnson, Roger Davies dodges Bell, Roger Davies dodges Spinnet as well... Roger Davies's going straight for goal! Roger Davies's going to shoot -- and -- and -- \" Lee swore very loudly. \"And Roger Davies's scored.\" ",
    "Harry and Hermione groaned with the rest of the Gryffindors. Predictably, horribly, the Slytherins on the other side of the stands began to sing: ",
    "\"Weasley cannot save a thing, ",
    "\"Weasley cannot block a single ring . . . ",
    "HarryHarry,\" said a hoarse voice in Harry's ear. \"Harry Harry looked around and saw Hagrid's enormous bearded face sticking between the seats; apparently Harry had squeezed Harry way all along the row behind, for the first and second years Harry had just passed had a ruffled, flattened look about the first and second years he had just passed. For some reason, Hagrid was bent double as though anxious not to be seen, though Hagrid was still at least four feet taller than everybody else. ",
    "\"Listen,\" Hagrid whispered, \"can yeh come with Hagrid? Now? While ev'ryone's watchin' the match?\" ",
    "\"Er ... can't it wait, Hagrid?\" asked Harry. \"Till the match is over? ",
    "\"No,\" said Hagrid. \"No, Harry, it's gotta be now ... while ev'ryone's lookin' the other way... Please?\" ",
    "Hagrid's nose was gently dripping blood. Harry eyes were both blackened. Harry had not seen Harry this close up since Harry return to the school; Harry looked utterly woebegone. ",
    "\" 'Course,\" said Harry at once, \" 'course we'll come...\" ",
    "Harry and Hermione edged back along Harry and Hermione row of seats, causing much grumbling among the students who had to stand up for Harry and Hermione. The people in Hagrid's row were not complaining, merely attempting to make The people in Hagrid's row as small as possible. ",
    "\"I 'ppreciate this, you two, I really do,\" said Hagrid as The people in Hagrid's row reached the stairs. Hagrid kept looking around nervously as The people in Hagrid's row descended toward the lawn below. ",
    "\"I jus' hope she doesn' notice us goin'...\" ",
    "\"You mean Umbridge?\" said Harry. \"she won't, she's got she whole Inquisitorial Squad sitting with she, didn't you see? she must be expecting trouble at the match.\" ",
    "\"Yeah, well, a bit o' trouble wouldn' hurt,\" said Hagrid, pausing to peer around the edge of the stands to make sure the stretch of lawn between there and Hagrid cabin was deserted. \"Give us more time ...\" ",
    "\"What is it, Hagrid?\" said Hermione, looking up at Hagrid with a concerned expression on she face as they hurried across the lawn toward the edge of the forest. ",
    "\"Hagrid -- yeh'll see in a mo',\" said Hagrid, looking over Hagrid shoulder as a great roar rose from the stands behind them. \"Hey -- did someone jus' score?\" ",
    "\"It'll be Ravenclaw,\" said Harry heavily. ",
    "\"Good ... good ...\" said Hagrid distractedly. \"Tha's good...\" ",
    "They had to jog to keep up with Hagrid as Hagrid strode across the lawn, looking around with every other step. When They reached his cabin, Hermione turned automatically left toward the front door; Hagrid, however, walked straight past it into the shade of the trees on the outermost edge of the forest, where Hagrid picked up a crossbow that was leaning against a tree. When Hagrid realized They were no longer with Hagrid, Hagrid turned. ",
    "\"We're goin' in here,\" Hagrid said, jerking Hagrid shaggy head behind Hagrid. ",
    "\"Into the forest?\" said Hermione, perplexed. ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid. \"C'mon now, quick, before We're spotted!\" ",
    "Harry and Hermione looked at each other, then ducked into the cover of the trees behind Hagrid, who was already striding away from \" ",
    "Harry and Hermione into the green gloom, a crossbow that was leaning against a treehis . Harry and Hermione ran to catch up with his. ",
    "\"Hagrid, why are you armed?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Jus' a precaution,\" said Hagrid, shrugging Hagrid massive shoulders. ",
    "\"You didn't bring your crossbow the day you showed us the thestrals,\" said Hermione timidly. ",
    "\"Nah, well, us weren' goin' in so far then,\" said Hagrid. \"An' anyway, tha' was before Firenze left the forest, wasn' it?\" ",
    "\"Why does Firenze leaving make a difference?\" asked Hermione curiously. ",
    "\" 'Cause the other centaurs are good an' riled at me, tha's why,\" said Hagrid quietly, glancing around. \"They used ter be -- well, yeh couldn' call 'em friendly -- but us got on all righ'. Kept 'emselves to 'emselves, bu' always turned up if I wanted a word. Not anymore ",
    "Kept ' sighed deeply. ",
    "\"Firenze said that They're angry because Kept ' went to work for Dumbledore?\" Harry asked, tripping on a protruding root because Harry was busy watching Hagrid 's profile. ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid heavily. \"Well, angry doesn' cover it. Ruddy livid. If I hadn' stepped in, I reckon they'd 've kicked Firenze ter death -- \" ",
    "\"they attacked him?\" said Hermione, sounding shocked. ",
    "\"Yep,\" said Hagrid gruffly, forcing Hagrid gruffly way through several low-hanging branches. \"Hagrid gruffly had half the herd onto Hagrid gruffly -- \" ",
    "\"And you stopped half the herd?\" said Harry, amazed and impressed. \"By yourself?\" ",
    "\" 'Course I did, couldn't stand by an' watch 'em kill him, could I?\" said Hagrid. \"Lucky I was passin', really ... an' I'd've thought Firenze mighta remembered tha' before Firenze mighta started sendin' me stupid warnin's!\" Firenze mighta added hotly and unexpectedly. ",
    "Harry and Hermione looked at each other, startled, but Hagrid, scowling, did not elaborate. ",
    "\"Anyway,\" Firenze mighta said, breathing a little more heavily than usual, \"since then the other centaurs Ve bin livid with Firenze mighta an' the trouble is, Harry and Hermione've got a lot of influence in the forest... Cleverest creatures in here ",
    "\"Is that why we're here, Hagrid?\" asked Hermione. \"The centaurs?\" ",
    "\"Ah no,\" said Hagrid, shaking his shaggy head dismissively, \"no, it's not them... Well, o' course, them could complicate the problem, yeah... But yeh'll see what I mean in a bit...\" ",
    "On this incomprehensible note Hagrid fell silent and forged a little ahead, taking one stride for every three of them, so that them had great trouble keeping up with Hagrid. ",
    "The path was becoming increasingly overgrown and the trees grew so closely together as them walked farther and farther into the forest that The path was as dark as dusk. them were soon a long way past the clearing where Hagrid had shown them the thestrals, but Harry felt no sense of unease until Hagrid stepped unexpectedly off The path and began wending Harry way in and out of trees toward the dark heart of the forest. ",
    "\"Hagrid?\" said Harry, fighting Harry way through thickly knotted brambles over which Hagrid had stepped easily and remembering very vividly what had happened to Harry on the other occasions Harry had stepped off The path. \"Where are we going?\" ",
    "\"Bit further,\" said Hagrid over Hagrid shoulder. \"C'mon, Harry... We need ter keep together now...\" ",
    "It was a great struggle to keep up with Hagrid, what with branches and thickets of thorn through which ",
    "Hagrid marched as easily as though they were cobwebs, but which snagged Harry and Hermione's robes, frequently entangling they so severely that they had to stop for minutes at a time to free they. Harry's arms and legs were soon covered in small cuts and scratches. Harry's arms and legs were so deep in the forest now that sometimes Harry Harry could see of Hagrid in the gloom was a massive dark shape ahead of Hagrid. Any sound seemed threatening in the muffled silence. The breaking of a twig echoed loudly and the tiniest rustle of movement, though The breaking of a twig might have been made by an innocent sparrow, caused Harry to peer through the gloom for a culprit. It occurred to Harry that Harry had never managed to get this far into the forest without meeting some kind of creature -- he had never managed to get this far into the forest without meeting some kind of creature absence struck Harry as rather ominous. ",
    "\"Hagrid, would it be all right if we lit we wands?\" said Hermione quietly. ",
    "\"Er ... all righ',\" Hagrid whispered back. \"In fact ...\" ",
    "\" Hagrid stopped suddenly and turned around; Hermione walked right into \" Hagrid and was knocked over backward. Harry caught Harry just before Harry hit the forest floor. ",

    "\"Good!\" said Hermione, as Harry set Harry back on Harry feet. They both murmured \"Lumos\\\" and They both wand tips ignited. Hagrid 's face swam through the gloom by the light of the two wavering beams and Harry saw that Harry looked nervous and sad again. ",
    "\"Righ,\" said Hagrid. \"Well ... see ... the thing is ...\" ",
    "Harry took a great breath. ",
    "\"Well, there's a good chance I'm goin' ter be gettin' the sack any day now,\" Harry said. ",

    "\"But you've lasted this long -- \" Hermione said tentatively. \"What makes you think -- \" ",
    "\"Umbridge reckons it was me that put tha' niffler in her office.\" ",
    "\"And was it?\" said Harry, before Harry could stop Harry. ",
    "\"No, it ruddy well wasn'!\" said Hagrid indignantly. \"On'y anythin' ter do with magical creatures an' On'y anythin' ter thinks it's got somethin' ter do with On'y anythin' ter.

    "Hagrid that Harry thought, with a jolt of dread, was sure to be the lair of some enormous animal.

    "\"Sleepin',\" breathed \" ",

    "\"Hagrid,\" her said in a whisper barely audible over the sound of the sleeping creature, \"who is Harry?\" ",

    "\"Hagrid, you told us,\" said Hermione, her wand now shaking in her hand, \"you told us none of them wanted to come!\" ",
    "Harry looked from her to Hagrid and then, as realization hit Harry, Harry looked back at the mound with a small gasp of horror. ",
    "The great mound of earth, on which Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid could easily have stood, was moving slowly up and down in time with the deep, grunting breathing. It was not a mound at all. It was the curved back of what was clearly . . . ",
    "\"Well -- no -- he didn' want ter come,\" said Hagrid, sounding desperate. \"But I had ter bring he, Hermione, I had ter!\" ",
    "\"But why?\" asked Hermione, who sounded as though she wanted to cry. \"Why -- what -- oh, Hagrid\\\" ",
    "\"I knew if I jus' got him back,\" said Hagrid, sounding close to tears him, \"an' -- an' taught him a few manners -- I'd be able ter take him outside an' show ev'ryone him's harmless!\" ",
    "\"Harmless!\" said Hermione shrilly, and Hagrid made frantic hushing noises with him hands as the enormous creature before them grunted loudly and shifted in the enormous creature sleep. \"him's been hurting you all this ",
    "time, hasn't him? That's why you've had all these injuries!\" ",
    "\"him don' know him own strength!\" said Hagrid earnestly. \"An' him's gettin' better, him's not fightin' so much anymore -- \" ",
    "\"So this is why it took you two months to get home!\" said Hermione distractedly. \"Oh Hagrid, why did you bring him back if him didn't want to come, wouldn't him have been happier with him own people?\" ",

    "\"Yeah ... well, tha's what it sounds like when Harry says Harry name,\" said Hagrid anxiously. \"Hagrid don' speak a lot of English... I've bin tryin' ter teach Hagrid... Anyway, mother don' seem ter have liked Hagrid much more'n mother liked me... See, with giantesses, what counts is producin' good big kids, and Hagrid's always been a bit on the runty side fer a giant -- on'y sixteen foot -- \" ",
    "\"Oh yes, tiny!\" said Hermione, with a kind of hysterical sarcasm. \"Absolutely minuscule!\" ",
    "\"Hagrid was bein' kicked around by all o' them -- I jus' couldn' leave Hagrid -- \" ",
    "\"Did Madame Maxime want to bring Hagrid back?\" asked Harry. ",
    "\"She -- well, She could see it was right importan' ter me,\" said Hagrid, twisting Hagrid enormous hands. \"Bu' -- bu' She got a bit tired of Hagrid after a while, I must admit ... so we split up on the journey home... She promised not ter tell anyone though...\" ",
    "\"How on earth did you get Hagrid back without anyone noticing?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Well, tha's why it took so long, see,\" said Hagrid. \"Could on'y travel by nigh an' through wild country an' stuff. 'Course, Hagrid covers the ground pretty well when Hagrid wants ter, but Hagrid kep' wantin' ter go back...\" ",
    "\"Oh Hagrid, why on earth didn't you let Hagrid!\" said Hermione, flopping down onto a ripped-up tree and burying She face in She hands. \"What do you think you're going to do with a violent giant who doesn't even want to be here!\" ",
    "\"Well, now -- Violent' -- tha's a bit harsh,\" said Hagrid, still twisting her hands agitatedly. \"I'll admit Hagrid mighta taken a couple o' swings at me when Hagrid's bin in a bad mood, but Hagrid's gettin' better, loads better, settlin' down well...\" ",
    "\"What are those ropes for, then?\" Harry asked. ",
    "Hagrid had just noticed ropes thick as saplings stretching from around the trunks of the largest nearby trees ",
    "toward the place where Grawp lay curled on the ground with Hagrid back to them. ",
    "\"You have to keep Hagrid tied up?\" said Hermione faintly. ",
    "\"Well ... yeah ...\" said Hagrid, looking anxious. \"See -- it's like I say -- Hagrid doesn' really know Hagrid strength -- Harry Harry understood now why there had been such a suspicious lack of any other living creature in this part of the forest. ",
    "\"So what is it you want Harry and Ron and me to do?\" Hermione asked apprehensively. ",
    "\"Look after him,\" said Hagrid croakily. \"After I'm gone.\" ",
    "Harry and Hermione exchanged miserable looks, ",
    "Harry uncomfortably aware that Harry had already promised Hagrid that Harry would do whatever Harry asked. ",
    "\"What -- what does that involve, exactly?\" Hermione inquired. ",
    "\"Not food or anythin'!\" said Hagrid eagerly. \"Hagrid can get Hagrid own food, no problem. Birds an' deer an' stuff ... No, it's company Hagrid needs. If I jus' knew someone was carryin' on tryin' ter help Hagrid a bit ... teachin' Hagrid, yeh know ...\" ",
    "Harry said nothing, but turned to look back at the gigantic form lying asleep on the ground in front of them. Grawp had Grawp back to them. Unlike Hagrid, who simply looked like a very oversize human, Grawp looked strangely misshapen. What Harry had taken to be a vast mossy boulder to the left of the great earthen mound Harry now recognized as Grawp 's head.  ",
    "It was much larger in proportion to the body than a human head, almost perfectly round and covered with tightly curling, close-growing hair the color of bracken. The rim of a single large, fleshy ear was visible on top of the head, which seemed to sit, rather like Uncle Vernon's, directly upon the shoulders with little or no neck in between. his back to them, under what looked like a dirty brownish smock comprised of animal skins sewn roughly together, was very broad, and as Grawp slept, it seemed to strain a little at the rough seams of the skins. The legs were curled up under the body; Harry could see the soles of enormous, filthy, bare feet, large as sledges, resting one on top of the other on the earthy forest floor. ",
    "\"You want us to teach Harry,\" Harry said in a hollow voice. Harry now understood what Firenze's warning had meant. Harry attempt is not working. Harry would do better to abandon His attempt. Of course, the other creatures who lived in the forest would have heard Hagrid's fruitless attempts to teach Grawp English... ",
    "\"Yeah -- even if yeh jus' talk ter him a bit,\" said Hagrid hopefully. \" 'Cause I reckon, if Harry can talk ter people, Harry'll understand more that we all like Harry really, an' want Harry to stay...Harry Harry looked at Hermione, who peered back at Harry from between the fingers over Harry face. ",
    "\"Kind of makes you wish we had Norbert back, doesn't it?\" Norbert said and Harry gave a very shaky laugh. ",
    "\"Yeh'll do it, then?\" said Hagrid, who did not seem to have caught what Harry had just said. ",
    "\"We'll ...\" said Harry, already bound by Harry promise. \"We'll try, Hagrid...\" ",
    "\"I knew I could count on yeh, Harry,Hagrid said, beaming in a very watery way and dabbing at his bruised face with Hagrid handkerchief again. \"An' I don' wan' yeh ter put yerself out too much, like... I know yeh've got exams... If YEH could jus' nip down here in yer Invisibility Cloak maybe once a week an' have a little chat with YEH ... I'll wake YEH up, then -- introduce you -- \" ",
    "\"Wha -- no!\" said Hermione, jumping up, \"Hagrid, no, don't wake YEH, really, we don't need -- \" ",
    "But Hagrid had already stepped over the great trunk in front of them and was proceeding toward Grawp. When Hagrid was around ten feet away, Hagrid lifted a long, broken bough from the ground, smiled reassuringly over Hagrid shoulder at Harry and Hermione, and then poked Grawp hard in the middle of the back with the end of the bough. ",
    "another giant gave a roar that echoed around the silent forest. Birds in the treetops overhead rose twittering from Birds in the treetops overhead perches and soared away. In front of Harry and Hermione, meanwhile, Grawp Grawp was rising from the ground, which shuddered as Hagrid placed an enormous hand upon Grawp to push Hagrid onto Hagrid knees and turned Hagrid head to see who and what had disturbed Hagrid. ",
    "\"All righ', Grawpy?\" said Hagrid in a would-be cheery voice, backing away with the long bough raised, ready to poke Grawp again. \"Had a nice sleep, eh?\" ",
    "Harry and Hermione retreated as far as \" ",
    "Harry and Hermione could while still keeping another giant within \" ",
    "Harry and Hermione sights. Grawp knelt between two trees Grawp had not yet uprooted. ",
    "\" ",
    "Harry and Hermione looked up into Grawp startlingly huge face, which resembled a gray full moon swimming in the gloom of the clearing. It was as though the features had been  ",
    "hewn onto a great stone ball. The nose was stubby and shapeless, the mouth lopsided and full of misshapen yellow teeth the size of half-bricks. The small eyes were a muddy greenish-brown and just now were half gummed together with sleep. Grawp raised dirty knuckles as big as cricket balls to The small eyes, rubbed vigorously, then, without warning, pushed Grawp to around ten feet with surprising speed and agility. ",
    "\"Oh my ...\" Harry heard Hermione squeal, terrified, beside Grawp. ",
    "The trees to which the other ends of the ropes around Grawp's wrists and ankles were attached creaked ominously. Grawp was, as Hagrid had said, at least sixteen feet tall. Gazing blearily around, Grawp reached out a hand the size of a beach umbrella, seized a bird's nest from the upper branches of a towering pine and turned a bird upside down with a roar of apparent displeasure that there was no bird in a bird's nest from the upper branches of a towering pine -- eggs fell like grenades toward the ground and Hagrid threw Grawp arms over Grawp head to protect Grawp. ",
    "\"Anyway, Grawpy,\" shouted Hagrid, looking up apprehensively in case of further falling eggs, \"I've brought some friends ter meet YEH. Remember, I told yeh I might? Remember, when I said I might have ter go on a little trip an' leave them ter look after yeh fer a bit? Remember that, Grawpy?\" ",
    "But Grawp merely gave another low roar; Grawp was hard to say whether Grawp was listening to Hagrid or whether Grawp even recognized the sounds Hagrid was making as speech. Grawp had now seized the top of the pine tree and was pulling the top of the pine tree toward Grawp, evidently for the simple pleasure of seeing how far the top of the pine tree would spring back when Grawp let go. ",
    "\"Now, Grawpy, don' do that!\" shouted Hagrid. \"Tha's how you ended up pullin' up the others -- \" ",
    "And sure enough, Harry could see the earth around the pine tree's roots beginning to crack. ",
    "\"I got company fer yeh!\" Hagrid shouted. \"Company, see! Look down, yeh big buffoon, I brought yeh some friends!\" ",
    "\"Oh Hagrid, don't,\" moaned Hermione, but Hagrid had already raised the bough again and gave Grawp's knee a sharp poke. ",
    "another giant let go of the top of the pine tree, which swayed menacingly and deluged Hagrid with a rain of needles, and looked down. ",
    "\"This,\" said Hagrid, hastening over to where Harry and Hermione stood, \"is Harry, Grawp! Harry Potter! He migh' be cornin' ter visit yeh if I have ter go away, understand?\" ",
    "another giant had only just realized that Harry and Hermione were there. Harry and Hermione watched, in great trepidation, as He lowered He huge boulder of a head so that He could peer blearily at Harry and Hermione. ",
    "\"An' this is Hermione, see? Hagrid hesitated. Turning to Hermione He said, \"Would yeh mind if He called yeh Hermy, Hermione? On'y it's a difficult name fer him ter remember...\" ",
    "\"No, not at all,\" squeaked Hermione. ",
    "\"This is Hermy, Grawp! An' she's gonna be cornin' an' all! Is'n tha' nice? Eh? Two friends fer yeh ter -- GRAWPY, NO!\" ",
    "Grawp's hand had shot out of nowhere toward Hermione -- Harry seized she and pulled she backward behind the pine tree, so that Grawp's fist scraped the trunk but closed on thin air. ",
    "\"BAD BOY, GRAWPY!\" Harry heard Hagrid yelling, as Hermione clung to Harry behind the pine tree, shaking and whimpering. \"VERY BAD BOY! YEH DON' GRAB ",
    "-- OUCH!\" ",
    "Harry poked his head out from around the trunk and saw Hagrid lying on Harry back, Harry hand over Harry nose. Grawp, apparently losing interest, had straightened up again and was again engaged in pulling back the pine as far as Grawp would go. ",
    "\"Righ',\" said Hagrid thickly, getting up with one hand pinching Hagrid bleeding nose and the other grasping Hagrid crossbow. \"Well ... there yeh are... Yeh've met Hagrid an' ",
    "-- an' now Yeh've'll know yeh when yeh come back. Yeah ...well...\" ",
    "Yeh've looked up at Grawp, who was now pulling back the pine with an expression of detached pleasure on Yeh've boulderish face; the roots were creaking as Yeh've ripped them away from the ground... ",
    "\"Well, I reckon tha's enough fer one day,\" said Hagrid. \"We'll -- er -- We'll go back now, shall We?\" ",
    "Harry and Hermione nodded. Hagrid shouldered his crossbow again and, still pinching his nose, led the way back into the trees. ",
    "Nobody spoke for a while, not even when \" ",
    "Harry and Hermione heard the distant crash that meant Grawp had pulled over the pine tree at last. Hermione's face was pale and set. Harry could not think of a single thing to say. What on earth was going to happen when somebody  ",
    "found out that Hagrid had hidden Grawp in the forest? And somebody  ",
    " had promised that somebody  ",
    ", Ron, and Hermione would continue Hagrid's totally pointless attempts to civilize another giant... How could Hagrid, even with somebody  ",
    " immense capacity to delude somebody  ",
    " that fanged monsters were lovably harmless, fool somebody  ",
    " that Grawp would ever be fit to mix with humans? ",

    ". somebody  ",
    " pulled an arrow out of the quiver over somebody  ",
    " shoulder and fitted an arrow into his crossbow. Harry and Hermione raised Harry and Hermione wands; now that Harry and Hermione had stopped walking, Harry and Hermione too could hear movement close by. ",
    "\"Oh blimey,\" said Hagrid quietly. ",
    "\"I thought that we told you, Hagrid,\" said a deep male voice, \"that you are no longer welcome here?\" ",
    "A man's naked torso seemed for an instant to be floating toward them through the dappled green half- light. Then them saw that A man waist joined smoothly with a horse's chestnut body. This centaur had a proud, high-cheekboned face and long black hair. ",
    "Like Hagrid, Hagrid was armed: A quiverful of arrows and a long bow were slung over Hagrid shoulders. ",
    "\"How are yeh, Magorian?\" said Hagrid warily. ",
    "The trees behind This centaur rustled and four or five more emerged behind Hagrid. Harry recognized the black-bodied and bearded Bane, whom Harry had met nearly four years ago on the same night Hagrid had met Firenze. Bane gave no sign that Bane had ever seen Harry before. ",
    "\"So,\" Bane said, with a nasty inflection in Bane voice, before turning immediately to Magorian. \"We agreed, I think, what We would do if this human showed Bane face in the forest again?\" ",
    "\" This human' now, am I?\" said Hagrid testily. \"Jus' fer stoppin' all of yeh committin' murder?\" ",
    "\"You ought not to have meddled, Hagrid,\" said Magorian. \"We ways are not yours, nor are We laws. Firenze has betrayed and dishonored We.\" ",
    "\"I dunno how yeh work that out,\" said Hagrid impatiently. \"Hagrid's done nothin' except help Albus Dumbledore -- \" ",
    "\"Firenze has entered into servitude to humans,\" said a gray centaur with a hard, deeply lined face. ",
    "\" Servitude !\" said Hagrid scathingly. \"Hagrid's doin' Dumbledore a favor is all -- \" ",
    "\"Hagrid is peddling our knowledge and secrets among humans,\" said Magorian quietly. \"There can be no return from such disgrace.\" ",
    "\"If yeh say so,\" said Hagrid, shrugging, \"but personally I think yeh 're makin' a big mistake -- \" ",
    "\"As are you, human,\" said Bane, \"coming back into our forest when our warned you -- \" ",
    "\"Now, you listen ter me,\" said Hagrid angrily. \"I'll have less of the 'our' forest, if it's all the same ter you. It's not up ter you who comes an' goes in here -- \" ",
    "\"No more is it up to you, Hagrid,\" said Magorian smoothly. \"I shall let you pass today because you are accompanied by your young -- \" ",
    "\"They're not you are accompanied by your young -- \" ",
    "!\" interrupted Bane contemptuously. \"Students, Magorian, from up at the school! Students, Magorian, from up at the school have probably already profited from the traitor F irenze 's teachings ...\" ",
    "\"Nevertheless,\" said Magorian calmly, \"the slaughter of foals is a terrible crime... our do not touch the innocent. Today, Hagrid, you pass. Henceforth, stay away from this place. You forfeited the friendship of the centaurs when you helped the traitor F irenze 's teachings Firenze escape our.\" ",
    "\"I won' be kept outta the fores' by a bunch of mules like you!\" said Hagrid loudly. ",
    "\"Hagrid,\" said Hermione in a high-pitched and terrified voice, as both Bane and the gray centaur pawed at the ground, \"let's go, please lets go! ",
    "Hagrid moved forward, but Hagrid crossbow was still raised and Hagrid eyes were still fixed threateningly upon Magorian. ",
    "\"our know what you are keeping in the forest, Hagrid!\" Magorian called after our, as the centaurs slipped out of sight. \"And our tolerance is waning!\" ",
    "Hagrid turned and gave every appearance of wanting to walk straight back to Magorian again. ",
    "\"You'll tolerate \" ",
    "Hagrid as long as \" ",
    "Hagrid's here, it's as much \" ",
    "Hagrid forest as yours!\" \" ",
    "Hagrid yelled, while Harry and Hermione both pushed with all Harry and Hermione both might against Hagrid 's moleskin waistcoat in an effort to keep \" ",
    "Hagrid moving forward. Still scowling, \" ",
    "Hagrid looked down; \" ",
    "Hagrid expression changed to mild surprise at the sight of them Harry and Hermione both pushing \" ",
    "Hagrid. \" ",
    "Hagrid seemed not to have felt it. ",
    "\"Calm down, you two,\" \" ",
    "Hagrid said, turning to walk on while they panted along behind \" ",
    "Hagrid. \"Ruddy old nags though, eh?\" ",
    "\"Hagrid,\" said Hermione breathlessly, skirting the patch of nettles they had passed on they way there, \"if the centaurs don't want humans in the forest, it doesn't really look as though Harry and I will be able ",
    "\"Ah, you heard what Harry and I said,\" said Hagrid dismissively \"Harry and I wouldn't hurt foals -- I mean, kids. Anyway, Harry and I can' let Harry and I be pushed around by that lot...\" ",
    "\"Nice try,Harry Harry murmured to Hermione, who looked crestfallen. ",
    "At last Harry and I rejoined the path and after another ten minutes, the trees began to thin. the trees were able to see patches of clear blue sky again and hear, in the distance, the definite sounds of cheering and shouting. ",
    "\"Was that another goal?\" asked Hagrid, pausing in the shelter of the trees as the Quidditch stadium came into view. \"Or d'you reckon the match is over?\" ",
    "\"I don't know,\" said Hermione miserably. Harry saw that Hermione looked much the worse for wear; Hermione hair was full of bits of twig and leaves, Hermione robes were ripped in several places and there were numerous scratches on Hermione face and arms. Harry knew Harry could look little better. ",
    "\"I reckon it's over, yeh know!\" said Hagrid, still squinting toward the Quidditch stadium. \"Look -- there's people cornin' out already -- if you two hurry yeh 'll be able ",
    "ter blend in with the crowd an' no one'll know you weren't there!\" ",
    "\"Good idea,\" said Harry. \"Well ... see you later, then, Hagrid...\" ",
    "\"I don't believe Harry,\" said Hermione in a very unsteady voice, the moment they were out of earshot of Hagrid. \"I don't believe Harry. I really don't believe Harry...\" ",
    "\"Calm down,\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Calm down!\" Hermione said feverishly. \"A giant! A giant in the Forbidden Forest! And we're supposed to give Harry English lessons! Always assuming, of course, we can get past the herd of murderous centaurs on the way in and out! I -- don't -- believe -- Harry!\" ",
    "\"We haven't got to do anything yet!\" Harry tried to reassure Harry in a quiet voice, as they joined a stream of jabbering Hufflepuffs heading back toward the castle. \"Harry's not asking We to do anything unless Harry gets chucked out and that might not even happen -- \" ",
    "\"Oh come off it, Harry!\" said Hermione angrily, stopping dead in Harry tracks so that the people behind Harry had to swerve to avoid Harry. \"Of course Harry's going to be chucked out and to be perfectly honest, after what We've just seen, who can blame Umbridge?\" ",
    "There was a pause in which Harry glared at Harry, and Harry eyes filled slowly with tears. ",
    "\"You didn't mean that,\" said Harry quietly. ",
    "\"No ... well ... all right ... I didn't,\" Harry said, wiping her eyes angrily. \"But why does Harry have to make life so difficult for Harry -- for We?\" ",

    "Harry and Hermione climbed the steps together. At the front doors both instinctively looked back at the Forbidden Forest.

As it was another fine, warm day, Harry and Hermione persuaded Ron to join Harry and Hermione in studying under the beech tree on the edge of the lake, where Harry and Hermione stood less chance of being overheard than in the common room. Ron was not particularly keen on this idea at first; Ron was thoroughly enjoying being patted on the back by Gryffindors walking past Ron chair, not to mention the occasional outbursts of \" ",

    "\"I'm not,\" said Harry quickly, looking down at Harry Transfiguration notes and attempting to straighten Harry's face. The truth was that Ron had just reminded Harry forcibly of another Gryffindor Quidditch player who had once sat rumpling his hair under the beech tree. \"I'm just glad we won, that's all.\" ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Ron slowly, savoring the words, \"we won. Did you see the look on Chang's face when Ginny got the Snitch right out from under Ginny nose?\" ",

This suited Harry very well; Harry was quite busy and tense enough without extra classes with Snape, and to Harry relief Hermione was much too preoccupied these days to badger Harry about Harry Occlumency.

    "'Tm doing eight,\" said Ernie, puffing out Ernie chest. \"Eight or nine. I'm getting an hour in before breakfast every day. Eight's my average. I can do ten on a good weekend day. I did nine and a half on Monday. Not so good on Tuesday -- only seven and a quarter. Then on Wednesday -- #\" ",
    "Harry was deeply thankful that Professor Sprout ushered them into greenhouse three at that point, forcing Ernie to abandon Ernie recital. ",
    "Meanwhile Draco Malfoy had found a different way to induce panic. ",
    "\"Of course, it's not what you know,\" Meanwhile Draco Malfoy was heard to tell Crabbe and Goyle loudly outside Potions a few days before the exams were to start, \"it's who you know. Now, Father's been friendly with the head of the Wizarding Examinations Authority for years -- old Griselda Marchbanks -- we've had old Griselda Marchbanks round for dinner and everything...\" ",
    "\"Do you think that's true?\" Hermione whispered to Harry and Ron, looking frightened. ",
    "\"Nothing we can do about it if it is,\" said Ron gloomily. ",
    "\"I don't think it's true,\" said Neville quietly from behind them. \"Because Griselda Marchbanks is a friend of my gran's, and Griselda Marchbanks's never mentioned the Malfoys.\" ",
    "\"What's Griselda Marchbanks like, Neville?\" asked Hermione at once. ",
    "\"Is Griselda Marchbanks strict?\" ",
    "\"Bit like Gran, really,\" said Neville in a subdued voice. ",
    "\"Knowing Griselda Marchbanks won't hurt your chances though, will it?\" Ron told Ron encouragingly. ",
    "\"Oh, I don't think it will make any difference,\" said Neville, still more miserably. \"Gran's always telling Griselda Marchbanks I'm not as good as my dad... Well ... you saw what my dad's like at St. Mungo's...\" ",
    "Neville looked fixedly at the floor. Harry, Ron, and Hermione glanced at one another, but didn't know what to say. It was the first time that Neville had acknowledged that Harry, Ron, and Hermione had met at the Wizarding hospital. ",
    "Meanwhile a flourishing black-market trade in aids to concentration, mental agility, and wakefulness had sprung up among the fifth and seventh years. Harry and Ron were much tempted by the bottle of Baruffio's Brain Elixir offered to Harry and Ron by Ravenclaw sixth year Eddie Carmichael, who swore it was solely responsible for the nine \"Outstanding\" O.W.L.s Baruffio's Brain Elixir had gained the previous summer and was offering the whole pint for a mere twelve Galleons. Ron assured Harry Ron would reimburse Baruffio's Brain Elixir for Baruffio's Brain Elixir half the moment Baruffio's Brain Elixir left Hogwarts and got a job, but before Harry and Ron could close the deal, Hermione had confiscated the bottle from Carmichael and poured the contents down a toilet. ",
    "\"Hermione, we wanted to buy that!\" shouted Ron. ",
    "\"Don't be stupid,\" \"Hermione snarled. \"You might as well take Harold Dingle's powdered dragon claw and have done with Harold Dingle's powdered dragon claw.\" ",
    "\"Dingle's got powdered dragon claw?\" said Ron eagerly. ",
    "\"Not anymore,\" said Hermione. \"I confiscated that too. None of these things actually works you know -- \" ",
    "\"Dragon claw does work!\" said Ron. \"It's supposed to be incredible, really gives your brain a boost, you come over all cunning for a few hours -- Hermione, let me have a pinch, go on, your brain can't hurt -- \" ",
    "\"This stuff can,\" said Hermione grimly. \"I've had a look at it, and it's actually dried doxy droppings.\" ",
    "This information took the edge off Harry and Ron's desire for brain stimulants. ",
    "This information received This information examination schedules and details of the procedure for O.W.L.s during This information next Transfiguration lesson. ",
    "\"As you can see,\" Professor McGonagall told the class while This information copied down the dates and times of This information exams from the blackboard, \"your O.W.L.s are spread over two successive weeks. You will sit the theory exams in the mornings and the practice in the afternoons. Your practical Astronomy examination will, of course, take place at night. ",
    "\"Now, I must warn you that the most stringent Anti- Cheating Charms have been applied to your examination papers. Auto-Answer Quills are banned from the examination hall, as are Remembralls, Detachable Cribbing Cuffs, and Self- Correcting Ink. Every year, I am afraid to say, seems to harbor at least one student who thinks that he or she can get around the Wizarding Examinations Authority's rules. I can only hope that it is nobody in Gryffindor. Our new -- headmistress\" -- Professor McGonagall pronounced the word with the same look on she face that Aunt Petunia had whenever Aunt Petunia was contemplating a particularly stubborn bit of dirt --  ",
    "\"has asked the Heads of House to tell the Heads of House students that cheating will be punished most severely -- because, of course, your examination results will reflect upon the headmistress's new regime at the school...\" ",
    "Professor McGonagall gave a tiny sigh. Harry saw the nostrils of Harry sharp nose flare. ",
    "\"However, that is no reason not to do your very best. You have your own futures to think about.\" ",
    "\"Please, Professor,\" said Hermione, Professor hand in the air, \"when will we find out we results?\" ",
    "\"An owl will be sent to you some time in July,\" said Professor McGonagall. ",
    "\"Excellent,\" said Dean Thomas in an audible whisper, \"so we don't have to worry about it till the holidays...#\" ",

    "Harry would be sure of one bit of post next summer... ",

    "Dinner was a subdued affair that night. Harry and Ron did not talk much, but ate with gusto, having studied hard all day. Hermione on the other hand kept putting down Hermione on the other hand knife and fork and diving under the table for Hermione on the other hand bag, from which Hermione on the other hand would seize a book to check some fact or figure. Ron was just telling Hermione on the other hand that Hermione on the other hand ought to eat a decent meal or Hermione on the other hand would not sleep that night, when Hermione on the other hand fork slid from Hermione on the other hand limp fingers and landed with a loud tinkle on Hermione on the other hand plate. ",
    "\"Oh, my goodness,\" Hermione on the other hand said faintly, staring into the entrance hall. \"Is that them? Is that the examiners?\" ",
    "Harry and Ron whipped around on \" ",
    "Harry and Ron bench. Through the doors to the Great Hall \" ",
    "Harry and Ron could see Umbridge standing with a small group of ancient- looking witches and wizards. Umbridge, Harry was pleased to see, looked rather nervous. ",
    "\"Shall we go and have a closer look?\" said Ron. ",
    "Harry and Ron nodded and Harry and Ron hastened toward the doors to the Great Hall into the entrance hall, slowing down as Harry and Ron stepped over the threshold to walk sedately past the examiners. Harry thought Griselda Marchbanks must be the tiny, stooped witch with a face so lined Griselda Marchbanks looked as though Griselda Marchbanks had been draped in cobwebs; Umbridge was speaking to Griselda Marchbanks very deferentially. Griselda Marchbanks seemed ",
    "to be a little deaf; Griselda Marchbanks was answering Umbridge very loudly considering that they were only a foot apart. ",
    "\"Journey was fine, journey was fine, we've made it plenty of times before!\" Griselda Marchbanks said impatiently. \"Now, I haven't heard from Dumbledore lately!\" Griselda Marchbanks added, peering around the Great Hall as though hopeful Dumbledore might suddenly emerge from a broom cupboard. \"No idea where Dumbledore is, I suppose?\" ",
    "\"None at all,\" said Umbridge, shooting a malevolent look at Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who were now dawdling around the foot of the stairs as Ron pretended to do up Ron shoelace. \"But I daresay the Ministry of Magic will track Ron down soon enough...\" ",
    "\"I doubt the Ministry of Magic,\" shouted tiny Professor Marchbanks, \"not if Dumbledore doesn't want to be found! I should know... Examined Ron personally in Transfiguration and Charms when Ron did N.E.W.T.s ... Did things with a wand I'd never seen before ...\" ",
    "\"Yes ... well ...\" said Professor Umbridge as Harry, Ron, and Hermione dragged Professor Umbridge as Harry, Ron, and Hermione feet up the marble staircase as slowly as Professor Umbridge as Harry, Ron, and Hermione dared, \"let me show you to the staffroom ... I daresay you'd like a cup of tea after your journey...\" ",
    "It was an uncomfortable sort of an evening. Everyone was trying to do some last-minute studying but nobody seemed to be getting very far. Harry went to bed early but then lay awake for what felt like hours. Harry remembered Harry careers consultation and McGonagall's furious declaration that she would help Harry become an Auror if it was the last thing she did... Harry wished Harry had expressed a more achievable ambition now that exam time was here... Harry knew that Harry was not the only one lying awake, but none of ",
    "the others in the dormitory spoke and finally, one by one, none of ",
    "the others in the dormitory fell asleep. ",
    "None of the fifth years talked very much at breakfast next day either. Parvati was practicing incantations under Parvati breath while the salt cellar in front of Parvati twitched, Hermione was rereading Achievement in Charming so fast that Parvati eyes appeared blurred, and Neville kept dropping Neville knife and fork and knocking over the marmalade. ",
    "Once breakfast was over, the fifth and seventh years milled around in the entrance hall while the other students went off to lessons. Then, at half-past nine, the other students were called forward class by class to reenter the Great Hall, which was now arranged exactly as Harry had seen it in the Pensieve when Harry father, Sirius, and Snape had been taking his father, Sirius, and Snape O.W.L.s. The four House tables had been removed and replaced instead with many tables for one, all facing the staff-table end of the Hall where Professor McGonagall stood facing the other students. When the other students were all seated and quiet Professor McGonagall said, \"You may begin,\" and turned over an enormous hourglass on the desk beside Professor McGonagall, on which were also spare quills, ink bottles, and rolls of parchment. ",
    "Harry turned over Harry paper, Harry heart thumping hard... Three rows to Harry right and four seats ahead, Hermione was already scribbling. . . Harry lowered Harry eyes to the first question: a) Give the incantation, and b) describe the wand movement required to make objects fly... ",
    "Harry had a fleeting memory of a club soaring high into the air and landing loudly on the thick skull of a troll... Smiling slightly, Harry bent over his paper and began to write... ",
    "\"Well, it wasn't too bad, was it?\" asked Hermione anxiously in the entrance hall two hours later, still clutching his paper. \"I'm not sure I did Harry justice on Cheering Charms, I just ran out of time -- did you put in the countercharm for hiccups? I wasn't sure whether I ought to, it felt like too much -- and on question twenty-three -- \" ",
    "\"Hermione,\" said Ron sternly, \"we've been through this before... we're not going through every exam afterward, it's bad enough doing them once.\" ",
    "The fifth years ate lunch with the rest of the school (The four House tables reappeared over the lunch hour) and then trooped off into the small chamber beside the Great Hall, where The four House tables were to wait until called for The four House tables practical examination. As small groups of students were called forward in alphabetical order, those left behind muttered incantations and practiced wand movements, occasionally poking one another in the back or eye by mistake. ",
    "Hermione's name was called. Trembling, she left the chamber with Anthony Goldstein, Gregory Goyle, and Daphne Greengrass. Students who had already been tested did not return afterward, so Harry and Ron had no idea how Hermione had done. ",
    "\"she'll be fine -- remember she got a hundred and twelve percent on one of our Charms tests?\" said Ron. ",
    "Ten minutes later, Professor Flitwick called, \"Parkinson, Pansy -- Patil, Padma -- Patil, Parvati -- Potter, Harry.\" ",
    "\"Good luck,\" said Ron quietly. Harry walked into the Great Hall, clutching Harry wand so tightly Harry hand shook. ",
    "\"Professor Tofty is free, Potter,\" squeaked Professor Flitwick, who was standing just inside the door. \"Professor Tofty pointed Harry toward what looked like the very oldest and baldest examiner, who was sitting behind a small table in a far corner, a short distance from Professor Marchbanks, who was halfway through testing Draco Malfoy. ",
    "Potter, is it?\" said \"Professor Tofty, consulting \"Professor Tofty notes and peering over \"Professor Tofty pince-nez at Harry as \"Professor Tofty approached. \"The famous Potter?\" ",
    "Out of the corner of \"Professor Tofty eye, Harry distinctly saw Draco Malfoy throw a scathing look over at Harry; the wine glass Draco Malfoy had been levitating fell to the floor and smashed. Harry could not suppress a grin. \"Professor Tofty smiled back at \"Professor Tofty encouragingly. ",
    "\"That's it,\" \"Professor Tofty said in \"Professor Tofty quavery old voice, \"no need to be nervous... Now, if I could ask you to take this eggcup and make this eggcup do some cartwheels for \"Professor Tofty...\" ",
    "On the whole Harry thought this eggcup went rather well; Harry Levitation Charm was certainly much better than Draco Malfoy's had been, though Harry wished Harry had not mixed up the incantations for Color- Change and Growth Charms, so that the rat Harry was supposed to be turning orange swelled shockingly and was the size of a badger before Harry could rectify Harry mistake. Harry was glad Hermione had not been in the Great Hall at the time and neglected to mention it to Hermione afterward. Harry could tell Ron, though; Ron had caused a dinner plate to mutate into a large mushroom and had no idea how it had happened. ",
    "There was no time to relax that night -- they went straight to the common room after dinner and submerged they in studying for Transfiguration ",
    "next day. Harry went to bed, Harry head buzzing with complex spell models and theories. ",
    "Harry forgot the definition of a Switching Spell during Harry written exam next morning, but thought Harry practical could have been a lot worse. At least Harry managed to vanish the whole of Harry iguana, whereas poor Hannah Abbott lost poor Hannah Abbott head completely at the next table and somehow managed to multiply poor Hannah Abbott ferret into a flock of flamingos, causing the examination to be halted for ten minutes while the birds were captured and carried out of the Great Hall. ",
    "the birds had the birds Herbology exam on Wednesday (other than a small bite from a Fanged Geranium, Harry felt Harry had done reasonably well) and then, on Thursday, Defense Against the Dark Arts. Here, for the first time, Harry felt sure Harry had passed. Harry had no problem with any of the written questions and took particular pleasure, during the practical examination, in performing all the counterjinxes and defensive spells right in front of Umbridge, who was watching coolly from near the doors into the entrance hall. ",
    "\"Oh bravo!\" cried Professor Tofty, who was examining Harry again, when Harry demonstrated a perfect boggart banishing spell. \"Very good indeed! Well, I think that's all, Potter ... unless ...\" ",
    "Harry leaned forward a little. ",
    "\"I heard, from my dear friend Tiberius Ogden, that you can produce a Patronus? For a bonus point ... ?\" ",
    "Harry raised \" ",
    "Harry , looked directly at Umbridge, and imagined \" ",
    "Harry being sacked. ",
    "\"Expecto Patronum).\" ",
    "The silver stag erupted from the end of The silver stag and cantered the length of the Great Hall. All of the examiners looked around to watch All of the examiners progress and when All of the examiners dissolved into silver mist, \"Professor Tofty clapped \"Professor Tofty veined and knotted hands enthusiastically.

    "\"Excellent!\" \"Professor Tofty said. \"Very well, Potter, you may go!\" ",
    "As Harry passed Umbridge beside the door their eyes met. There was a nasty smile playing around her wide, slack mouth, but \"Professor Tofty did not care. Unless \"Professor Tofty was very much mistaken (and \"Professor Tofty was not planning on saying it to anybody, in case \"Professor Tofty was), \"Professor Tofty had just achieved an \"Outstanding\" O.W.L.

    "On Friday, Harry and Ron had a day off while Hermione sat Hermione Ancient Runes exam, and as they had the whole weekend in front of they, they permitted they a break from studying. they stretched and yawned beside the open window, through which warm summer air wafted over they as they played a desultory game of wizard chess. Harry could see Hagrid in the distance, teaching a class on the edge of the forest. Harry was trying to guess what creatures what creatures were examining -- Harry thought it must be unicorns, because the boys seemed to be standing back a little -- when the portrait hole opened and Hermione clambered in, looking thoroughly bad tempered. ",
    "\"How were Ancient Runes?\" said Ron, yawning and stretching. ",
    "\"I mistranslated 'ehwaz,' \" said Hermione furiously. \"It means 'partnership,' not 'defense,' I mixed it up with 'eihwaz.' \" ",
    "\"Ah well,\" said Ron lazily, \"that's only one mistake, isn't it, you'll still get -- \" ",
    "\"Oh shut up,\" said Hermione angrily, \"it could be the one mistake that makes the difference between a pass and a fail. And what's more, someone's put another niffler in Umbridge's office, I don't know how they got it through that new door, but I just walked past there and Umbridge is shrieking her head off -- by the sound of it, it tried to take a chunk out of her leg -- \" ",
    "\"Good,\" said Harry and Ron together. ",
    "\"It is not good!\" said Hermione hotly. \"Hermione thinks it's Hagrid doing it, remember? And we do not want Hagrid chucked out!\" ",
    "\"Hagrid's teaching at the moment, Hermione can't blame Hagrid,\" said Harry, gesturing out of the window. ",
    "\"Oh, you're so naive sometimes, Harry, you really think Umbridge will wait for proof?\" said Hermione, who seemed determined to be in a towering temper, and Hermione swept off toward the girls' dormitories, banging that new door behind Hermione. ",
    "\"Such a lovely, sweet-tempered girl,\" said Ron, very quietly, prodding Hagrid queen forward so that his queen could begin beating up one of Harry's knights. ",
    "Hermione 's bad mood persisted for most of the weekend, though Harry and Ron found it quite easy to ignore as Harry and Ron spent most of Saturday and Sunday studying for Potions on Monday, the exam to which Harry was looking forward least and which Harry was sure would be the one that would be the downfall of Harry ambitions to become an Auror. Sure enough, Harry found the written exam difficult, though Harry thought Harry might have got full marks on the question about Polyjuice Potion: Harry could describe its effects extremely accurately, having taken its illegally in Harry second year. ",
    "The afternoon practical was not as dreadful as Harry had expected it to be. With Snape absent from the proceedings Harry found that Harry was much more relaxed than Harry usually was while making potions. Neville, who was sitting very near Harry, also looked happier than Harry had ever seen Harry during a Potions class. When \"Professor Tofty said, \"Step away from your cauldrons, please, the examination is over,Harry Harry corked Harry sample flask feeling that Harry might not have achieved a good grade but that Harry had, with luck, avoided a fail. ",
    "\"Only four exams left,\" said Parvati Patil wearily as \"Only four exams headed back to Gryffindor common room. ",
    "\"Only!\" said Hermione snappishly. \"I've got Arithmancy and Arithmancy's probably the toughest subject there is!\" ",
    "Nobody was foolish enough to snap back, so Arithmancy was unable to vent Arithmancy spleen on any of \"Only four exams and was reduced to telling off some first years for giggling too loudly in the common room. ",
    "Harry was determined to perform well in Tuesday's Care of Magical Creatures exam so as not to let Hagrid down. The practical examination took place in the afternoon on the lawn on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, where students were required to correctly identify the knarl hidden among a dozen hedgehogs (the trick was to offer them all milk in turn: knarls, highly suspicious creatures whose quills had many magical properties, generally went berserk at what whose quills saw as an attempt to poison whose quills); then demonstrate correct handling of a bowtruckle, feed and clean a fire-crab without sustaining serious burns, and choose, from a wide selection of food, the diet whose quills would give a sick unicorn. ",
    "Harry could see Hagrid watching anxiously out of Harry cabin window. When Harry's examiner, a plump little witch this time, smiled at Harry and told Harry Harry could leave, Harry gave Hagrid a fleeting thumbs-up before heading back up to the castle. ",
    "The Astronomy theory exam on Wednesday morning went well enough; Harry was not convinced Harry had got the names of all of Jupiter's moons right, but was at least confident that none of the names of all of Jupiter's moons was inhabited by mice. none of them was inhabited by mice had to wait until evening for none of them was inhabited by mice practical Astronomy; the afternoon was devoted instead to Divination. ",
    "Even by Harry's low standards in Divination, The Astronomy theory exam on Wednesday morning went very badly. The Astronomy theory exam on Wednesday morning might as well have tried to see moving pictures in the desktop as in the stubbornly blank crystal ball; The Astronomy theory exam on Wednesday morning lost The Astronomy theory exam on Wednesday morning head completely during tea-leaf reading, saying it looked to The Astronomy theory exam on Wednesday morning as though \"Professor Tofty would shortly be meeting a round, dark, soggy stranger, and rounded off the whole fiasco by mixing up the life and head lines on \"Professor Tofty palm and informing \"Professor Tofty that \"Professor Tofty ought to have died the previous Tuesday. ",
    "\"Well, we were always going to fail that one,\" said Ron gloomily as they ascended the marble staircase. Ron had just made Harry feel rather better by telling Harry how Harry told the examiner in detail about the ugly man with a wart on Ron nose in Ron crystal ball, only to look up and realize Ron had been describing Ron examiner's reflection. ",
    "\"we shouldn't have taken the stupid subject in the first place,\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Still, at least we can give the stupid subject up now.\" ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"No more pretending we care what happens when Jupiter and Uranus get too friendly ...\" ",
    "\"And from now on, I don't care if my tea leaves spell die, Ron, die -- I'm just chucking them in the bin where them belong.\" ",
    "Harry laughed just as Hermione came running up behind them. Harry stopped laughing at once, in case it annoyed her. ",
    "\"Well, I think I've done all right in Arithmancy,\" her said, and Harry and Ron both sighed with relief. \"Just time for a quick look over our star charts before dinner, then ...\" ",
    "When Harry and Ron both reached the top of the Astronomy Tower at eleven o'clock Harry and Ron both found a perfect night for stargazing, cloudless and still. The grounds were bathed in silvery moonlight, and there was a slight chill in the air. Each of Harry and Ron both set up his or her telescope and, when \"Professor Tofty gave the word, proceeded to fill in the blank star chart \"Professor Tofty or her had been given. ",
    "Professors Marchbanks and Tofty strolled among Professors Marchbanks and Tofty, watching as Professors Marchbanks and Tofty entered the precise positions of the stars and planets Professors Marchbanks and Tofty were observing. All was quiet except for the rustle of parchment, the occasional creak of a telescope as it was adjusted on it stand, and the scribbling of many quills. Half an hour passed, then an hour; the little squares of reflected gold light flickering on the ground below started to vanish as lights in the castle windows were extinguished. ",
    "As Harry completed the constellation Orion on Harry chart, however, the front doors of the castle opened directly below the parapet where Harry was standing, so ",
    "that light spilled down the stone steps a little way across the lawn. Harry glanced down as Harry made a slight adjustment to the position of Harry telescope and saw five or six elongated shadows moving over the brightly lit grass before the front doors of the castle swung shut and the lawn became a sea of darkness once more. ",
    "Harry put Harry eye back to his telescope and refocused his telescope, now examining Venus. Harry looked down at his chart to enter the planet there, but something distracted Harry. Pausing with Harry quill suspended over the parchment, Harry squinted down into The grounds and saw half a dozen figures walking over the lawn. If half a dozen figures had not been moving, and the moonlight had not been gilding the tops of half a dozen figures heads, half a dozen figures would have been indistinguishable from the dark ground on which half a dozen figures stood. Even at this distance, Harry had a funny feeling that Harry recognized the walk of the squattest among them, who seemed to be leading the group. ",
    "Harry could not think why Umbridge would be taking a stroll outside past midnight, much less accompanied by five others. Then somebody coughed behind Harry, and Harry remembered that Harry was halfway through an exam. Harry had quite forgotten Venus's position -- jamming his eye to his telescope, Harry found his telescope again and was again on the point of entering his telescope on his chart when, alert for any odd sound, Harry heard a distant knock that echoed through The grounds, followed immediately by the muffled barking of a large dog. ",
    "Harry looked up, Harry heart hammering. There were lights on in Hagrid's windows and the people Harry had observed crossing the lawn were now silhouetted against the people he had observed crossing. The door opened and Harry distinctly saw six tiny but sharply defined figures walk over the ",
    "threshold. The door closed again and there was silence. ",
    "Harry felt very uneasy. Harry glanced around to see whether Ron or Hermione had noticed what Harry had, but \"Professor Tofty came walking behind Harry at that moment, and not wanting to appear as though Harry was sneaking looks at anyone else's work, \"Professor Tofty hastily bent over his chart and pretended to be adding notes to his chart while really peering over the top of the parapet toward Hagrid's cabin. Figures were now moving across the cabin windows, temporarily blocking the light. ",
    "\"Professor Tofty could feel \"Professor Tofty's eyes on the back of \"Professor Tofty neck and pressed his eye again to his telescope, staring up at the moon though \"Professor Tofty had marked his telescope position an hour ago, but as \"Professor Tofty \"Professor Tofty moved on \"Professor Tofty heard a roar from the distant cabin that echoed through the darkness right to the top of the Astronomy Tower. Several of the people around Harry ducked out from behind the people around Harry telescopes and peered instead in the direction of Hagrid's cabin. ",
    "\"Professor Tofty gave another dry little cough. ",
    "\"Try and concentrate, now, boys and girls,\" \"Professor Tofty said softly. ",
    "Most people returned to Most people . Harry looked to Harry left. Hermione was gazing transfixed at Hagrid. ",
    "\"Ahem -- twenty minutes to go,\" said \"Professor Tofty. ",
    "Hermione jumped and returned at once to \"Professor Tofty star chart; Harry looked down at Harry own and noticed that ",
    "Harry had mislabelled Venus as Mars. Harry bent to correct it. ",
    "There was a loud BANG from the grounds. Several people said \"Ouch!\" as Several people poked Several people in the face with the ends of Several people telescopes, hastening to see what was going on below. ",
    "Hagrid's door had burst open and by the light flooding out of the cabin Several people saw Hagrid quite clearly, a massive figure roaring and brandishing Hagrid fists, surrounded by six people, all of whom, judging by the tiny threads of red light Several people were casting in Hagrid direction, seemed to be attempting to Stun Hagrid.

    "\"No!\" cried Hermione. ",
    "\"My dear!\" said \"Professor Tofty in a scandalized voice. \"This is an examination!\" ",
    "But nobody was paying the slightest attention to nobody star charts anymore: Jets of red light were still flying beside Hagrid's cabin, yet somehow nobody seemed to be bouncing off Hagrid. Hagrid was still upright and still, as far as Harry could see, fighting. Cries and yells echoed across The grounds; a man yelled, \"Be reasonable, Hagrid!\" and Hagrid roared, \"Reasonable be damned, yeh won' take me like this, Dawlish!\" ",
    "Harry could see the tiny outline of Fang, attempting to defend Hagrid, leaping at the wizards surrounding Fang until a Stunning Spell caught Fang and Fang fell to the ground. Hagrid gave a howl of fury, lifted the culprit bodily from the ground, and threw Fang: a man flew what looked like ten feet and did not get up again. Hermione gasped, both hands over her mouth; Harry looked around at Ron and saw that Ron too was looking scared. None of them had ever seen Hagrid in a real temper before... ",
    "\"Look!\" squealed Parvati, who was leaning over the parapet and pointing to the foot of the castle where the front doors of the castle seemed to have opened again; more light had spilled out onto the dark lawn and a single long black shadow was now rippling across the dark lawn. ",
    "\"Now, really!\" said \"Professor Tofty anxiously. \"Only sixteen minutes left, you know!\" ",
    "But nobody paid a man the slightest attention: nobody were watching the person now sprinting toward the battle beside Hagrid's cabin. ",
    "\"How dare you!\" the figure shouted as she ran. \"How dare you!\" ",
    "\"It's McGonagall!\" whispered Hermione. ",
    "\"Leave the figure alone! Alone, I say!\" said Professor McGonagall's voice through the darkness. \"On what grounds are you attacking him? him has done nothing, nothing to warrant such -- \" ",
    "Hermione, Parvati, and Lavender all screamed. No fewer than four Stunners had shot from the figures around the cabin toward Professor McGonagall. Halfway between cabin and castle the red beams collided with she. For a moment she looked luminous, illuminated by an eerie red glow, then was lifted right off she feet, landed hard on she back, and moved no more. ",
    "\"Galloping gargoyles!\" shouted Professor Tofty, who seemed to have forgotten the exam completely. \"Not so much as a warning! Outrageous behavior!\" ",
    "\"COWARDS!\" bellowed Hagrid, Hagrid voice carrying clearly to the top of the tower, and several lights ",
    "flickered back on inside the castle. \"RUDDY COWARDS! HAVE SOME O' THAT -- AN' THAT -- \" ",
    "\"Oh my -- \" gasped Hermione. ",
    "Hagrid took two massive swipes at Hagrid closest attackers; judging by his closest attackers immediate collapse, his closest attackers had been knocked cold. Harry saw Harry double over and thought for a moment that Harry had finally been overcome by a spell, but on the contrary, next moment Hagrid was standing again with what appeared to be a sack on Harry back -- then Harry realized that Fang's limp body was draped around Harry shoulders. ",
    "\"Get Harry, get Harry!\" screamed Umbridge, but Umbridge remaining helper seemed highly reluctant to go within reach of Hagrid 's fists. Indeed, Harry was backing away so fast Harry tripped over one of Harry unconscious colleagues and fell over. Hagrid had turned and begun to run with Fang still hung around Hagrid neck; Umbridge sent one last Stunning Spell after Hagrid but Umbridge missed, and Hagrid, running full-pelt toward the distant gates, disappeared into the darkness.

    "There was a long minute's quivering silence, everybody gazing openmouthed into the grounds. Then \"Professor Tofty's voice said feebly, \"Um ... five minutes to go, everybody ...\" ",
    "Though Hagrid had only filled in two-thirds of his chart, Harry was desperate for the end of the exam. When it came at last Harry, Ron, and Hermione forced last he, Ron telescopes haphazardly back into last he, Ron holders and dashed back down the spiral staircase. None of the students were going to bed -- None of the students were all talking loudly and excitedly at the foot of the stairs about what None of the students had witnessed. ",
    "\"That evil woman!\" gasped Hermione, who seemed to be having difficulty talking due to rage. \"Trying to sneak up on Hagrid in the dead of night!\" ",
    "\"She clearly wanted to avoid another scene like Trelawney's,\" said Ernie Macmillan sagely, squeezing over to join another scene like Trelawney. ",
    "\"Hagrid did well, didn't Ernie Macmillan?\" said Ron, who looked more alarmed than impressed. \"How come all the spells bounced off Ernie Macmillan?\" ",
    "\"It'll be Ernie Macmillan giant blood,\" said Hermione shakily. \"It's very hard to Stun a giant, Stun're like trolls, really tough... But poor Professor McGonagall... Four Stunners straight in the chest, and Four Stunners straight in the chest's not exactly young, is Four Stunners straight in the chest?\" ",
    "\"Dreadful, dreadful,\" said Ernie, shaking Ernie head pompously. \"Well, I'm off to bed... 'Night, all ...\" ",
    "People around them were drifting away, still talking excitedly about what People around them had just seen. ",
    "\"At least People around them didn't get to take Hagrid off to Azkaban,\" said Ron. \"I 'spect Ron's gone to join Dumbledore, hasn't Ron?\" ",
    "\"I suppose so,\" said Hermione, who looked tearful. \"Oh, this is awful, I really thought Dumbledore would be back before long, but now we've lost Hagrid too...\" ",
    "They traipsed back to the Gryffindor common room to find the Gryffindor common room full. The commotion out in The grounds had woken several people, who had hastened to rouse They friends. Seamus and Dean, who had arrived ahead of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, were now telling everyone what everyone had heard from the top of the Astronomy Tower. ",
    "\"But why sack Hagrid now?\" asked Angelina Johnson, shaking Angelina Johnson . \"It's not like Trelawney, Trelawney's been teaching much better than usual this year!\" ",
    "Umbridge hates part-humans,\" said Hermione bitterly, flopping down into an armchair. \"Angelina Johnson was always going to try and get Hagrid out.\" ",
    "\"And Angelina Johnson thought Hagrid was putting nifflers in Angelina Johnson office,\" piped up Katie Bell. ",
    "\"Oh blimey,\" said Lee Jordan, covering Lee Jordan mouth. ",
    "\"It's me's been putting nifflers in her office, Fred and George left me a couple, I've been levitating Fred and George in through Angelina Johnson window...\" ",
    "\"Angelina Johnson'd have sacked Lee Jordan anyway,\" said Dean. \"Lee Jordan was too close to Dumbledore.\" ",
    "\"That's true,\" said Harry, sinking into an armchair beside Hermione 's. ",
    "\"I just hope Professor McGonagall's all right,\" said Lavender tearfully. ",
    "\"Fred and George carried Lavender back up to the castle, we watched through her window,\" said Colin Creevey. \"Lavender didn't look very well...\" ",
    "\"Madam Pomfrey will sort Lavender out,\" said Alicia Spinnet firmly. \"Lavender's never failed yet.\" ",
    "It was nearly four in the morning before the common room cleared. Harry felt wide awake -- the image of Hagrid sprinting away into the dark was haunting Harry. Harry was so angry with Umbridge Harry could not think of a punishment bad enough for Lavender, though Ron's suggestion of having Lavender fed to a box of starving Blast-Ended Skrewts had her fed to a box of starving Blast-Ended Skrewts merits. Harry fell asleep  ",
    "contemplating hideous revenges and arose from bed three hours later feeling distinctly unrested. ",
    "Their final exam, History of Magic, was not to take place until that afternoon. Harry would very much have liked to go back to bed after breakfast, but Harry had been counting on the morning for a spot of last- minute studying, so instead Harry sat with Harry head in Harry hands by the common room window, trying hard not to doze off as Harry read through some of the notes stacked three-and-a-half feet high that Hermione had lent Harry. ",
    "The fifth years entered the Great Hall at two o'clock and took their places in front of their overturned examination papers. Harry felt exhausted. Harry just wanted this to be over so that Harry could go and sleep. Then tomorrow, Harry and Ron were going to go down to the Quidditch pitch -- Harry was going to have a fly on Ron's broom and savor he and Ron freedom from studying... ",
    "\"Turn over your papers,\" said Professor Marchbanks from the front of the Great Hall, flicking over the giant hourglass. \"You may begin...\" ",
    "Harry stared fixedly at the first question. It was several seconds before It occurred to \" ",
    "Harry that \" ",
    "Harry had not taken in a word of it; there was a wasp buzzing distractingly against one of the high windows. Slowly, tortuously, \" ",
    "Harry began to write an answer. ",
    "\" ",
    "Harry was finding it very difficult to remember names and kept confusing dates. \" ",
    "Harry simply skipped question four: In your opinion, did wand legislation contribute to, or lead to better control of, goblin riots of the eighteenth century? thinking that \" ",
    "Harry would go back to it if \" ",
    "Harry had time at the end. \" ",
    "Harry had a stab at question five: How was the Statute of Secrecy breached in 1 749 and what measures were introduced to prevent a  ",
    "recurrence? but had a nagging suspicion that \" ",
    "Harry had missed several important points. \" ",
    "Harry had a feeling vampires had come into the story somewhere... ",
    "\" ",
    "Harry looked ahead for a question \" ",
    "Harry could definitely answer and \" ",
    "Harry eyes alighted upon number ten. ",
    "Describe the circumstances that led to the Formation of the International Confederation of Wizards and explain why the warlocks of Liechtenstein refused to join. ",
    "I know this, Harry thought, though Harry brain felt torpid and slack. Harry could visualize a heading, in Hermione's handwriting: the Formation of the International Confederation of Wizardsthe International Confederation of WizardsWizards. . . Harry had read these notes only this morning... ",
    "Harry began to write, looking up now and again to check the large hourglass on the desk beside Professor Marchbanks. Harry was sitting right behind Parvati Patil, whose long dark hair fell below the back of her chair. Once or twice Harry found Harry staring at the tiny golden lights that glistened in it when her moved her very slightly and had to give Harry own head a little shake to clear it. ",
    "... the first Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards Wizards was Pierre Bonaccord, but the first Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards appointment was contested by the Wizarding community of Liechtenstein, because -- ",
    "All around Harry quills were scratching on parchment like scurrying, burrowing rats. The sun was very hot on the back of his head. What was The sun that Bonaccord had done to offend the wizards of Liechtenstein? ",
    "Harry had a feeling The sun had something to do with trolls... Harry gazed blankly at the back of his head again. If Harry could only perform Legilimency and open  ",
    "a window in the back of his head and see what it was about trolls that had caused the breach between Pierre Bonaccord and Liechtenstein... ",
    "Harry closed his eyes and buried Harry face in his hands, so that the glowing red of Harry eyelids grew dark and cool. Pierre Bonaccord had wanted to stop troll- hunting and give the trolls rights . . . but Liechtenstein was having problems with a tribe of particularly vicious mountain trolls... That was it... ",
    "Harry opened his eyes; they stung and watered at the sight of the blazing- white parchment. Slowly Harry wrote two lines about the trolls then read through what Harry had done so far. It did not seem very informative or detailed, yet Harry was sure Hermione's notes on the International Confederation of Wizards had gone on for pages and pages... ",
    "Harry closed his eyes again, trying to see them, trying to remember. . . the International Confederation of Wizards had met for the first time in France, yes, Harry had written that already... ",
    "Goblins had tried to attend and been ousted... Harry had written that too... ",
    "And nobody from Liechtenstein had wanted to come ",
    "Think, Harry told Harry, Harry face in his hands, while all around Harry quills scratched out never-ending answers and the sand trickled through the large hourglass on the desk beside Professor Marchbanks at the front... ",
    "Harry was walking along the cool, dark corridor to the Department of Mysteries again, walking with a firm and purposeful tread, breaking occasionally into a run, determined to reach Harry destination at last... The black door swung open for Harry as usual, and here Harry was in the circular room with The black door many doors... ",
    "Straight across the stone floor and through the second door . . . patches of dancing light on the walls and floor and that odd mechanical clicking, but no time to explore, Harry must hurry... ",
    "Harry jogged the last few feet to the third door, which swung open just like the others... ",
    "Once again Harry was in the cathedral-sized room full of shelves and glass spheres... Harry heart was beating very fast now... Harry was going to get there this time... When Harry reached number ninety-seven Harry turned left and hurried along the aisle between two rows... ",
    "But there was a shape on the stone floor at the very end, a black shape moving upon the stone floor like a wounded animal... Harry's stomach contracted with fear ... with excitement... ",
    "A voice issued from Harry own mouth, a high, cold voice empty of any human kindness, \"Take it for Harry... Lift it down, now... I cannot touch it ... but you can...\" ",
    "The black shape upon the stone floor shifted a little. Harry saw a long-fingered white hand clutching a wand rise on the end of Harry own arm . . . heard the high, cold voice say, \" Cruciol \" ",
    "The man on the stone floor let out a scream of pain, attempted to stand but fell back, writhing. Harry was laughing. Harry raised Harry wand, the curse lifted, and the figure groaned and became motionless. ",
    "\"Lord Voldemort is waiting...\" ",
    "Very slowly, Harry arms trembling, the man on the ground raised Harry shoulders a few inches and lifted his head. Harry face was bloodstained and gaunt, twisted in pain yet rigid with defiance... ",
    "\"You'll have to kill me,\" whispered Sirius. ",
    "\"Undoubtedly I shall in the end,\" said the cold voice. \"But you will fetch the cold voice for Harry first, Black... You think you have felt pain thus far? Think again... We have hours ahead of We and nobody to hear you scream...\" ",
    "But somebody screamed as \"Lord Voldemort lowered \"Lord Voldemort again; somebody yelled and fell sideways off a hot desk onto the stone floor. Harry hit the ground and awoke, still yelling, Harry scar on fire, as the Great Hall erupted all around Harry. "

  "OUT OF THE FIRE": [
    "\"I'm not going... I don't need the hospital wing... I don't want ...\" ",
    "Harry was gibbering, trying to pull away from Professor Tofty, who was looking at Harry with much concern, and who had just helped Harry out into the entrance hall while the students all around them stared. ",
    "\"I'm -- I'm fine, sir,Harry Harry stammered, wiping the sweat from His face. \"Really ... I just fell asleep... Had a nightmare ...\" ",
    "\"Pressure of examinations!\" said the old wizard sympathetically, patting Harry shakily on the shoulder. \"It happens, young man, It happens! Now, a cooling drink of water, and perhaps you will be ready to return to the Great Hall? The examination is nearly over, but you may be able to round off your last answer nicely?\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Harry wildly. \"I mean ... no ... I've done -- done as much as I can, I think...\" ",
    "\"Very well, very well,\" said the old wizard gently. \"I shall go and collect your examination paper, and I suggest that you go and have a nice lie down...\" ",
    "\"I'll do that,\" said Harry, nodding vigorously. \"Thanks very much.\" ",
    "Harry waited for the second when the old man's heels disappeared over the threshold into the Great Hall, then ran up the marble staircase and then more staircases toward the hospital wing, hurtling along the corridors so fast that the portraits Harry passed muttered reproaches, and burst through the double doors like a hurricane, causing Madam Pomfrey, who had been spooning some bright blue liquid into Montague's open mouth, to shriek in alarm. ",
    "\"Potter, what do you think you're doing?\" ",
    "\"I need to see Professor McGonagall,\" gasped Harry, the breath tearing Harry lungs. \"Now ... It's urgent...\" ",
    "\"She's not here, \"Potter,\" said Madam Pomfrey sadly. \"She was transferred to St. Mungo's this morning. Four Stunning Spells straight to the chest at She age? It's a wonder they didn't kill She.\" ",
    "\"She's ... gone?\" said Harry, stunned. ",
    "The bell rang just outside the dormitory, and Harry heard the usual distant rumbling of students starting to flood out into the corridors above and below Harry. Harry remained quite still, looking at Madam Pomfrey. Terror was rising inside Harry. ",
    "There was nobody left to tell. Dumbledore had gone, Hagrid had gone, but Dumbledore had always expected Professor McGonagall to be there, irascible and ",
    "inflexible, perhaps, but always dependably, solidly present... ",
    "\"I don't wonder you're shocked, \"Potter,\" said Madam Pomfrey with a kind of fierce approval in Madam Pomfrey face. \"As if one of them could have Stunned Minerva McGonagall face on by daylight! Cowardice, that's what it was... Despicable cowardice ... If I wasn't worried what would happen to you students without me, I'd resign in protest...\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Harry blankly. ",
    "Harry strode blindly from the hospital wing into the teeming corridor where Harry stood, buffeted by the crowd, the panic expanding inside Harry like poison gas so that Harry head swam and Harry could not think what to do... ",
    "Ron and Hermione, said a voice in his head. ",
    "Harry was running again, pushing students out of the way, oblivious to students angry protests and shouts. Harry sprinted back down two floors and was at the top of the marble staircase when Harry saw Ron and Hermione hurrying toward Harry. ",
    "\"Harry!\" said Hermione at once, looking very frightened. \"What happened? Are you all right? Are you ill?\" ",
    "\"Where have you been?\" demanded Ron. ",
    "\"Come with Harry,\"Harry said quickly. \"Come on, I've got to tell you something...\" ",
    "Harry led Ron and Hermione along the first-floor corridor, peering through doorways, and at last found an empty classroom into which Harry dived, closing the door ",
    "behind Ron and Hermione the moment Ron and Hermione were inside and leaning against it, facing Ron and Hermione. ",

    "\"What?\" ",
    "\"How d'you -- ?\" ",
    "\"Saw it. Just now. When I fell asleep in the exam.\" ",
    "\"But -- but where? How?\" said Hermione, whose face was white. ",
    "\"I dunno how,\" said Harry. \"But I know exactly where. There's a room in the Department of Mysteries Mysteries full of shelves covered in these little glass balls, and they're at the end of row ninety-seven ... He's trying to use Sirius to get whatever it is He wants from in there... He's torturing He... Says He'll end by killing He ...\" ",
    "Harry found He voice was shaking, as were He knees. He moved over to a desk and sat down on a desk, trying to master He. ",
    "\"How're we going to get there?\" He asked them. ",
    "There was a moment's silence. Then Ron said, \"G-get there?\" ",
    "\"Get to the Department of MysteriesMysteries, so them can rescue Sirius!\" Harry said loudly. ",
    "\"But \" ",
    "Harry ...\" said Ron weakly. ",

How would \"Lord Voldemort and Sirius have got in without being seen? Harry . . . Voldemort and Sirius're probably the two most wanted wizards in the world... You think Voldemort and Sirius could get into a building full of Aurors undetected?\" ",
    "\"I dunno, \"Lord Voldemort used an Invisibility Cloak or something!\" Harry shouted. \"Anyway, the Department of Mysteries Mysteries has always been completely empty whenever I've been -- \" ",
    "\"You've never been there, Harry,\" said Hermione quietly. \"You've dreamed about the place, that's all.\" ",
    "\"Voldemort and Sirius're not normal dreams!\" Harry shouted in her face, standing up and taking a step closer to her in turn. Harry wanted to shake her. \"How Harry explain Ron's dad then, what was all that about, how come I knew what had happened to Ron's dad?\" ",
    "\"Ron's dad's got a point,\" said Ron quietly, looking at Hermione. ",
    "\"But this is just -- just so unlikely\\\" said Hermione desperately. \"Harry, how on earth could \"Lord Voldemorthave got hold of Sirius when \"Lord Voldemort's been in Grimmauld Place all the time?\" ",
    "\"Sirius might've cracked and just wanted some fresh air,\" said Ron, sounding worried. \"\"Lord Voldemort's been desperate to get out of that house for ages -- \" ",
    "\"But why,\" Hermione persisted, \"why on earth would \"Lord Voldemort want to use Sirius to get the weapon, or whatever the thing is?\" ",
    "\"I dunno, there could be loads of reasons!\" Harry yelled at her. \"Maybe Sirius is just someone \"Lord Voldemort doesn't care about seeing hurt -- \" ",
    "\"You know what, I've just thought of something,\" said Ron in a hushed voice. \"Sirius's brother was a Death Eater, wasn't Sirius's brother? Maybe Sirius's brother told Sirius the secret of how to get the weapon!\" ",
    "\"Yeah -- and that's why Dumbledore's been so keen to keep Sirius locked up all the time!\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Look, I'm sorry,\" cried Hermione, \"but neither of you are making sense, and we've got no proof for any of this, no proof \"Lord Voldemort and Sirius are even there -- \" ",
    "\"Hermione, Harry's seen Voldemort and Sirius!\" said Ron, rounding on her. ",
    "\"Okay,\" her said, looking frightened yet determined, \"I've just got to say this...\" ",
    "\"What?\" ",
    "\"You ... This isn't a criticism, Harry! But you do ... sort of ... I mean -- don't you think you've got a bit of a -- a -- saving-people-thing?\" her said. ",
    "Ron glared at her. \"And what's that supposed to mean, a 'saving-people-thing'?\" ",
    "\"Well ... you ...\" her looked more apprehensive than ever. \"I mean . . . last year, for instance ... in the lake ... during the Tournament ... you shouldn't have ... I mean, you didn't need to save her... You got a bit ... carried away ...\" ",
    "A wave of hot, prickly anger swept Harry's body -- how could her remind Harry of that blunder now? ",
    "\"... I mean, it was really great of you and everything,\" said Hermione quickly, looking positively petrified at the look on Harry's face. \"Everyone thought it was a wonderful thing to do -- \" ",
    "\"That's funny,\" said Harry in a trembling voice, \"because I definitely remember Ron saying I'd wasted time acting the hero... Is that what you think this is? You reckon I want to act the hero again?\" ",
    "\"No, no, no!\" said Hermione, looking aghast. \"That's not what I mean at all!\" ",
    "\"Well, spit out what you've got to say, because we're wasting time here!\" Harry shouted. ",

    "\"Never you mind,\" said Harry roughly. ",
    "Ginny raised Ginny eyebrows. ",

    "\"I've told you, I saw -- \" ",

    "\"How?\" Harry demanded. \"How're we going to check?\" ",
    "\"we'll have to use Umbridge's fire and see if we can contact Umbridge,\" said Hermione, who looked positively terrified at the thought. \"Well draw Umbridge away again, but we'll need lookouts, and that's where we can use Ginny and Luna.\" ",

    "Nobody answered Ginny. ",

    "Again, Harry ignored Ginny. ",
    "\"Right,\" said Hermione, twisting Ginny hands together and pacing up and down between the desks. \"Right ... well ... One of we has to go and find Umbridge and -- and send Ginny off in the wrong direction, keep Ginny ",
    "away from Ginny office. They could tell Ginny -- I don't know -- that Peeves is up to something awful as usual...\" ",
    "\"I'll do it,\" said Ron at once. \"I'll tell Peeves Peeves is smashing up the Transfiguration department or something, it's miles away from her office. Come to think of it, I could probably persuade Peeves to do it if I met Peeves on the way...\" ",
    "It was a mark of the seriousness of the situation that Hermione made no objection to the smashing up of the Department of Mysteries. ",
    "\"Okay,\" Hermione said, Hermione brow furrowed as Hermione continued to pace. \"Now, we need to keep students away from her office while we force entry, or some Slytherin's bound to go and tip Hermione off...\" ",
    "\"Luna and I can stand at either end of the corridor,\" said Ginny promptly, \"and warn people not to go down there because someone's let off a load of Garroting Gas.\" Hermione looked surprised at the readiness with which Ginny had come up with this lie.

    "\"Okay,\" said Hermione, \"well then, Harry, you and I will be under the Invisibility Cloak, and we'll sneak into her office and you can talk to Sirius -- \" ",
    "\"He's not there, Hermione!\" ",
    "\"I mean, you can -- can check whether Sirius is at home or not while I keep watch, I don't think you should be in there alone, Lee's already proved the window's a weak spot, sending those nifflers through the window.\" ",

    "\"I ... okay, thanks,\" Lee muttered. ",
    "\"Right, well, even if we do all of that, I don't think we're going to be able to bank on more than five minutes,\" said Hermione, looking relieved that Harry seemed to have accepted the plan, \"not with Filch and the wretched Inquisitorial Squad floating around.\" ",
    "\"Five minutes'll be enough,\" said Harry. \"C'mon, let's go ",
    "\"Now?\" said Hermione, looking shocked. ",
    "\"Of course now!\" said Harry angrily. \"What did you think, we're going to wait until after dinner or something? Hermione, Sirius is being tortured right now\\\" ",

    "Harry did not answer, but flung Harry out of the room and began to fight Harry way through the milling crowds outside. Two floors up Harry met Seamus and Dean, who hailed Harry jovially and told Harry Two floors up were planning a dusk-till-dawn end-of-exams celebration in the room. Harry barely heard Two floors up. Harry scrambled through the portrait hole while Two floors up were still arguing about how many black-market butterbeers Two floors up would need and was climbing back out of it, the Invisibility Cloak and Sirius's knife secure in Harry bag, before Two floors up noticed Harry had left Two floors up.

    "HarryHarry, d'you want to chip in a couple of Galleons? Harold Dingle reckons Harold Dingle could sell us some firewhisky...\" ",
    "But Harry was already tearing away back along the corridor, and a couple of minutes later was jumping the last few stairs to join Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Luna, who were huddled together at the end of Umbridge's corridor. ",
    "\"Got it,\" Harry panted. \"Ready to go, then?\" ",
    "\"All right,\" whispered Hermione as a gang of loud sixth years passed them. \"So Ron -- you go and head Umbridge off... Ginny, Luna, if you can start moving people out of the corridor. . . Harry and I will get the Invisibility Cloak on and wait until the coast is clear...Ron Ron strode away, Ron bright red hair visible right to the end of the passage. Meanwhile, Ginny's equally vivid head bobbed between the jostling students surrounding them in the other direction, trailed by Luna's blonde one. ",
    "\"Get over here,\" muttered Hermione, tugging at Harry's wrist and pulling Harry back into a recess where the ugly stone head of a medieval wizard stood muttering to a medieval wizard on a column. \"Are -- are you sure you're okay, Harry? You're still very pale...\" ",
    "\"I'm fine,\" Harry said shortly, tugging the Invisibility Cloak from out of his bag. In truth, Harry scar was aching, but not so badly that Harry thought \"Lord Voldemort had yet dealt Sirius a fatal blow. he thought Voldemort had yet dealt Sirius a fatal blow had hurt much worse than this when \"Lord Voldemort had been punishing Avery. . .

    "\"Here,\" \"Lord Voldemort said. \"Lord Voldemort threw the Invisibility Cloak over both of them and them stood listening carefully over the Latin mumblings of the bust in front of them. ",
    "\"You can't come down here!\" Ginny was calling to the crowd. \"No, sorry, you're going to have to go round by the swiveling staircase, someone's let off Garroting Gas just along here -- \" ",
    "them could hear people complaining; one surly voice said, \"I can't see no gas ...\" ",
    "\"That's because it's colorless,\" said Ginny in a convincingly exasperated voice, \"but if you want to walk through it, carry on, then we'll have your body as proof for the next idiot who didn't believe we...\" ",
    "Slowly the crowd thinned. The news about the Garroting Gas seemed to have spread -- people were not coming this way anymore. When at last the surrounding area was quite clear, Hermione said quietly, \"I think that's as good as we're going to get, Harry -- come on, letwe do it.\" ",
    "Together Together moved forward, covered by the Invisibility Cloak. Luna was standing with Luna back to Together at the far end of the corridor. As Together passed Ginny, Hermione whispered, \"Good one ... don't forget the signal ...\" ",
    "\"What's the signal?\" muttered Harry, as they approached Umbridge's door. ",
    "\"A loud chorus of Weasley Is Our King' if they see Umbridge coming,\" replied Hermione, as Harry inserted the blade of Sirius's knife in the crack between door and wall. The lock clicked open, and The lock entered her office. ",
    "The garish kittens were basking in the late afternoon sunshine warming The garish kittens plates, but otherwise her office was as still and empty as last time. Hermione breathed a sigh of relief. ",
    "\"I thought Hermione might have added extra security after the second niffler...\" ",
    "The lock pulled off the Invisibility Cloak. Hermione hurried over to the window and stood out of sight, peering down into the grounds with Hermione wand out. Harry dashed over to the fireplace, seized the pot of Floo powder, and threw a pinch into the grate, causing emerald flames to burst into life there. Harry knelt down quickly, thrust Harry head into the dancing fire, and cried, \"Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!\" ",
    "his head began to spin as though Harry had just got off a fairground ride though Harry knees remained firmly planted upon the cold office floor. Harry kept Harry eyes screwed up against the whirling ash, and when the spinning stopped, Harry opened them to find Harry looking out upon the long, cold kitchen of Grimmauld Place. ",
    "There was nobody there. Harry had expected this, yet was not prepared for the molten wave of dread and panic that seemed to burst through Harry stomach floor at the sight of the deserted room. ",
    "\"Sirius?\" Harry shouted. \"Sirius, are you there?\" ",
    "Harry voice echoed around the deserted room, but there was no answer except a tiny scuffing sound to the right of the fire. ",
    "\"Who's there?\" Harry called, wondering whether it was just a mouse. ",
    "Kreacher the house-elf came creeping into view. Kreacher looked highly delighted about something, though Kreacher seemed to have recently sustained a nasty injury to both hands, which were heavily bandaged. ",
    "\"It's the Potter boy's head in the fire,Kreacher Kreacher informed the empty kitchen, stealing furtive, oddly triumphant glances at Harry. \"What has Kreacher come for, Kreacher wonders?\" ",
    "\"Where's Sirius, Kreacher?\" Harry demanded. ",
    "the house-elf gave a wheezy chuckle. \"Kreacher has gone out, Harry Potter.\" ",
    "\"Where's Kreacher gone? Where's Kreacher gone, Kreacher?\" Kreacher merely cackled. ",
    "\"I'm warning you!\" said Harry, fully aware that Kreacher scope for inflicting punishment upon Kreacher was almost nonexistent in this position. \"What about Lupin? Mad-Eye? Any of What about Lupin, are any of What about Lupin here?\" ",
    "\"Nobody here but Kreacher!\" said the house-elf gleefully, and turning away from Harry Kreacher began to walk slowly toward the door at the end of the kitchen. \"Kreacher thinks Kreacher will have a little chat with Kreacher Mistress now, yes, Kreacher hasn't had a chance in a long time, Kreacher has been keeping Kreacher away from Kreacher -- \" ",
    "\"Where has Sirius gone?\" Harry yelled after the house-elf. \"Kreacher, has Kreacher gone to the Department of Mysteries?Kreacher stopped in Kreacher tracks. Harry could just make out the back of Harry bald head through the forest of chair legs before Harry. ",
    "Kreacher does not tell poor Kreacher where Harry is going,\" said the house-elf quietly. ",
    "\"But you know!\" shouted Harry. \"Don't you? You know where Harry is!\" ",
    "There was a moment's silence, then the house-elf let out Harry loudest cackle yet. \"Kreacher will not come back from the Department of MysteriesMysteries!\" he said gleefully. \"Kreacher and his Mistress are alone again!\" ",
    "And Kreacher scurried forward and disappeared through the door to the hall. ",
    "\"You -- !\" ",
    "But before Kreacher could utter a single curse or insult, Harry felt a great pain at the top of his bald head. Harry inhaled a lot of ash and, choking, found Harry being dragged backward through the flames until, with a horrible abruptness, Harry was staring up into the wide, pallid face of Professor Umbridge, who had dragged Harry backward out of the fire by the hair and was now bending Harry neck back as far as it would go as though she was going to slit Harry throat. ",
    "\"You think,\" she whispered, bending Harry's neck back even farther, so that Harry was looking up at the ceiling above Harry, \"that after two nifflers I was going to let one more foul, scavenging little creature enter her office without my knowledge? I had Stealth Sensoring Spells placed all around my doorway after the last one got in, you foolish boy. Take her wand out,\" she barked at someone Harry could not see, and Harry felt a hand grope inside the chest pocket of Harry robes and remove her wand out. \"she too ...\" ",
    "Harry heard a scuffle over by the door and knew that Hermione had just had she wrested from she as well. ",
    "\"I want to know why you are in her office,\" said Umbridge, shaking the fist clutching Umbridge hair so that Umbridge staggered. ",
    "\"I was -- trying to get my Firebolt!\" Harry croaked. ",
    "\"Liar.\" she shook his bald head again. \"my Firebolt is under strict guard in the dungeons, as you very well know, Harry Potter. You had his bald head in the fire. With whom have you been communicating?\" ",
    "\"No one -- \" said Harry, trying to pull away from she. Harry felt several hairs part company with Harry scalp. ",
    "\"LiaA\" shouted Umbridge. she threw Harry from she, and Harry slammed into the desk. Now Harry could see Hermione pinioned against the wall by Millicent Bulstrode. Malfoy was leaning on the windowsill, smirking as Malfoy threw Harry's wand into the air one- handed and then caught Harry's wand again. ",
    "There was a commotion outside and several large Slytherins entered, each gripping Ron, Ginny, Luna, and -- to Harry's bewilderment -- Neville, who was trapped in a stranglehold by Crabbe and looked in imminent danger of suffocation. All four of Neville, who was trapped in a stranglehold by Crabbe and looked in imminent danger of suffocation had been gagged. ",
    "\"Got 'em all,\" said Warrington, shoving Ron roughly forward into the deserted room. \" That one.\" Ron poked a thick finger at Neville, \"tried to stop me taking she,\" Ron pointed at Ginny, who was trying to kick the shins of the large Slytherin girl holding she, \"so I brought Ron along too.\" ",
    "\"Good, good,\" said Umbridge, watching Ginny's struggles. \"Well, it looks as though Hogwarts will shortly be a Weasley-free zone, doesn't it?\" ",
    "Malfoy laughed loudly and sycophantically. Umbridge gave Umbridge wide, complacent smile and settled Umbridge into a chintz-covered armchair, blinking up at Umbridge captives like a toad in a flowerbed. ",
    "\"So, Harry Potter,\" Umbridge said. \"You stationed lookouts around her office and you sent this buffoon,\" Umbridge nodded at Ron, and Malfoy laughed even louder, \"to tell me the poltergeist was wreaking havoc in the Department of Mysteries when I knew perfectly well that the poltergeist was busy smearing ink on the eyepieces of all the school telescopes, the poltergeist having just informed me so. ",
    "\"Clearly, it was very important for you to talk to somebody. Was it Albus Dumbledore? Or the half- breed, Hagrid? I doubt it was Minerva McGonagall, I hear Umbridge is still too ill to talk to anyone...\" ",
    "Malfoy and a few of the other members of the Inquisitorial Squad laughed some more at that. Harry found Harry was so full of rage and hatred Harry was shaking. ",
    "\"It's none of your business who I talk to,\" Harry snarled. ",
    "Umbridge's slack face seemed to tighten. ",
    "\"Very well,\" Umbridge said in Umbridge most dangerous and falsely sweet voice. \"Very well, Mr. Potter ... I offered you the chance to tell me freely. You refused. I have no alternative but to force you. Draco -- fetch Professor Snape.\" ",
    "Malfoy stowed Harry's wand inside his robes and left the deserted room smirking, but Harry hardly noticed. Harry had ",
    "just realized something; Harry could not believe Harry had been so stupid as to forget it. Harry had thought that all the members of the Order, all those who could help Harry save Sirius, were gone -- but Harry had been wrong. There was still a member of the Order of the Phoenix at Hogwarts -- Snape. ",
    "There was silence in her office except for the fidgetings and scufflings resultant from Slytherins efforts to keep Ron and the others under control. Ron's lip was bleeding onto Umbridge's carpet as Ron struggled against Warrington's half nelson. Ginny was still trying to stamp on the feet of the sixth-year girl who had both Ginny upper arms in a tight grip. Neville was turning steadily more purple in the face while tugging at Crabbe's arms, and Hermione was attempting vainly to throw Millicent Bulstrode off Millicent Bulstrode. Luna, however, stood limply by the side of Luna captor, gazing vaguely out of the window as though rather bored by the proceedings. ",
    "Harry looked back at Umbridge, who was watching Harry closely. Harry kept the face deliberately smooth and blank as footsteps were heard in the corridor outside and \" ",
    "Malfoy came back into the deserted room, holding open the door for Professor Snape. ",
    "\"You wanted to see me, Headmistress?\" said Professor Snape, looking around at all the pairs of struggling students with an expression of complete indifference. ",
    "\"Ah, Professor Snape,\" said Umbridge, smiling widely and standing up again. \"Yes, I would like another bottle of Veritaserum, as quick as you can, please.\" ",
    "\"You took my last bottle to interrogate Harry Potter,\" he said, observing Ginny coolly through he greasy curtains of black hair. \"Surely you did not use it all? I told you that three drops would be sufficient.\" ",
    "Umbridge flushed. ",
    "\"You can make some more, can't you?\" Ginny said, Ginny voice becoming more sweetly girlish as her voice always did when Ginny was furious. ",
    "\"Certainly,\" said Professor Snape, Professor Snape lip curling. \"It takes a full moon cycle to mature, so I should have It ready for you in around a month.\" ",
    "\"A month?\" squawked Umbridge, swelling toadishly. ",
    "\"A month? But I need it this evening, Professor Snape! I have just found Harry Potter using my fire to communicate with a person or persons unknown!\" ",
    "\"Really?\" said Professor Snape, showing Professor Snape first, faint sign of interest as Professor Snape looked around at Harry. \"Well, it doesn't surprise me. Harry Potter has never shown much inclination to follow school rules.\" ",
    "Professor Snape cold, dark eyes were boring into Harry's, who met Professor Snape gaze unflinchingly, concentrating hard on what Professor Snape had seen in Professor Snape dream, willing Professor Snape to read it in Professor Snape mind, to understand . . . ",
    "\"I wish to interrogate Professor Snape!\" shouted Umbridge angrily, and Professor Snape looked away from Harry back into the face. \"I wish you to provide me with a potion that will force Professor Snape to tell me the truth!\" ",
    "\"I have already told you,\" said Professor Snape smoothly, \"that I have no further stocks of Veritaserum. Unless you wish to poison Harry Potter -- and I assure you I would have the greatest sympathy with you if you did -- I cannot help you. The only trouble is that most venoms act too fast to give the victim much time for truth-telling...Professor Snape Professor Snape looked back at Harry, who stared at Professor Snape, frantic to communicate without words. ",
    "Voldemort's got Sirius in the Department of MysteriesMysteries, Voldemort thought desperately. Voldemort's got Sirius in the Department of Mysteries -- ",
    "\"You are on probation!\" shrieked Umbridge, and Professor Snape looked back at Umbridge, Professor Snape eyebrows slightly raised. \"You are being deliberately unhelpful! I expected better, \" ",
    "Malfoy always speaks most highly of you! Now get out of her office!Professor Snape Professor Snape gave Professor Snape an ironic bow and turned to leave. Harry knew Harry last chance of letting the Order know what was going on was walking out of the door. ",
    "\"Harry's got Padfoot!\" Harry shouted. \"Harry's got Padfoot at the place where it's hidden!Professor Snape Professor Snape had stopped with Harry hand on Umbridge's door handle. ",
    "\"Padfoot?\" cried Umbridge, looking eagerly from Harry to Professor Snape. \"What is Padfoot? Where what is hidden? What does Harry mean, Professor Snape?Professor Snape Professor Snape looked around at Harry. Harry face was inscrutable. Harry could not tell whether Harry had understood or not, but Harry did not dare speak more plainly in front of Umbridge. ",
    "\"I have no idea,\" said Professor Snape coldly. \"Harry Potter, when I want nonsense shouted at Harry I shall give you a Babbling Beverage. And Crabbe, loosen your hold a little, if Longbottom suffocates it will mean a lot of tedious paperwork, and I am afraid I shall have to mention it on your reference if ever you apply for a job.\" ",
    "Harry closed the door with a snap, leaving Harry in a state of worse turmoil than before: Professor Snape had been Professor Snape very last hope. Professor Snape looked at Umbridge, who seemed to be feeling the same way; Professor Snape chest was heaving with rage and frustration. ",
    "\"Very well,\" Professor Snape said, and Professor Snape pulled out Professor Snape . \"Very well ... I am left with no alternative... This is more than a matter of school discipline... This is an issue of Ministry security... Yes ... yes ...\" ",
    "Professor Snape seemed to be talking Professor Snape into something. Professor Snape was shifting Professor Snape weight nervously from foot to foot, staring at Harry, beating Professor Snape against Professor Snape empty palm and breathing heavily. Harry felt horribly powerless without her wand out as Harry watched Professor Snape. ",
    "\"You are forcing me, Harry Potter... I do not want to,\" said Umbridge, still moving restlessly on the spot, \"but sometimes circumstances justify the use ... I am sure the Minister will understand that I had no choice...\" ",
    "Malfoy was watching Professor Snape with a hungry expression on the Minister face. ",
    "\"The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue,\" said Umbridge quietly. ",
    "\"No!\" shrieked Hermione. \"Umbridge -- it's illegal\" -- but Umbridge took no notice. There was a nasty, eager, excited look on Professor Snape face that Harry had never seen before. Professor Snape raised Professor Snape . ",
    "\"the Minister wouldn't want you to break the law, Professor Umbridge!\" cried Hermione. ",
    "\"What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt What Cornelius,\" said Umbridge, who was now panting slightly as Professor Snape pointed Professor Snape at different parts of Harry's body in ",
    "turn, apparently trying to decide what would hurt the most. \"What Cornelius never knew I ordered dementors after Harry Potter last summer, but What Cornelius was delighted to be given the chance to expel What Cornelius, all the same...\" ",
    "\"It was you?\" gasped Harry. \" You sent dementors after me?\" ",
    "\" Somebody had to act,\" breathed Umbridge, as Professor Snape came to rest pointing directly at Harry's forehead. \"They were all bleating about silencing you somehow -- discrediting you -- but I was the one who actually did something about it... Only you wriggled out of that one, didn't you, Harry Potter? Not today, though, not now ...\" ",
    "And taking a deep breath, Harry Potter cried, \"Cruc -- \" ",
    "\"NO!\" shouted Hermione in a cracked voice from behind Millicent Bulstrode. \"No -- Harry -- Harry, well have to tell Harry Potter!\" ",
    "\"No way!\" yelled Harry, staring at the little of Hermione Harry could see. ",
    "\"We'll have to, Harry, shell force it out of Harry anyway, what's ... what's the point... ?\" ",
    "And Hermione began to cry weakly into the back of Millicent Bulstrode robes. Millicent Bulstrode stopped trying to squash Millicent Bulstrode against the wall immediately and dodged out of Millicent Bulstrode way looking disgusted. ",
    "\"Well, well, well!\" said Umbridge, looking triumphant. \"Little Miss Question-All is going to give We some answers! Come on then, Millicent Bulstrode, come on!\" ",
    "\"Er -- my -- nee -- no!\" shouted Ron through Ron gag. ",
    "Ginny was staring at Hermione as though Ginny had never seen Ginny before; Neville, still choking for breath, was gazing at Ginny too. But Harry had just noticed something. Though Hermione was sobbing desperately into Hermione hands, there was no trace of a tear... ",
    "\"I'm -- I'm sorry everyone,\" said Hermione. \"But -- I can't stand it -- #\" ",
    "\"That's right, that's right, girl!\" said Umbridge, seizing Hermione by the shoulders, thrusting Hermione into the abandoned chintz chair and leaning over Hermione. \"Now then ... with whom was Harry Potter communicating just now?\" ",
    "\"Well,\" gulped Hermione into her hands, \"well, he was trying to speak to Albus Dumbledore...\" ",
    "Ron froze, he eyes wide; Ginny stopped trying to stamp on Ginny Slytherin captor's toes; Luna looked mildly surprised. Fortunately, the attention of Umbridge and Umbridge minions was focused too exclusively upon Hermione to notice these suspicious signs. ",
    "Albus Dumbledore?\" said Umbridge eagerly. \"You know where Albus Dumbledore is, then?\" ",
    "\"Well ... no!\" sobbed Hermione. \"We've tried the Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley and the Three Broomsticks and even the Hog's Head -- \" ",
    "\"Idiot girl, Albus Dumbledore won't be sitting in a pub when the whole Ministry's looking for Albus Dumbledore!\" shouted Umbridge, disappointment etched in every sagging line of Ginny face. ",
    "\"But -- but We needed to tell Albus Dumbledore something important!\" wailed Hermione, holding her hands more tightly over her face, not, Harry knew, out of anguish, but to disguise the continued absence of tears. ",
    "\"Yes?\" said Umbridge with a sudden resurgence of excitement. \"What was it you wanted to tell Umbridge?\" ",
    "\"We ... We wanted to tell Umbridge it's r-ready!\" choked Hermione. ",
    "\"What's ready?\" demanded Umbridge, and now Umbridge grabbed Hermione 's shoulders again and shook Umbridge slightly. \"What's ready, girl?\" ",
    "\"The ... the weapon,\" said Hermione. ",
    "\"Weapon? Weapon?\" said Umbridge, and Umbridge eyes seemed to pop with excitement. \"You have been developing some method of resistance? A weapon you could use against the whole Ministry? On Albus DumbledoreAlbus Dumbledore's orders, of course?\" ",
    "\"Y-y-yes,\" gasped Hermione. \"But Umbridge had to leave before it was finished and n-n-now we've finished it for Umbridge, and we c-c-can't find Umbridge t-t-to tell Umbridge!\" ",
    "\"What kind of weapon is it?\" said Umbridge harshly, Umbridge stubby hands still tight on Hermione 's shoulders. ",
    "\"we don't r-r-really understand it,\" said Hermione, sniffing loudly. \"We j-j-just did what P-P-Professor Dumbledore told us t-t-to do ...\" ",
    "Umbridge straightened up, looking exultant. ",
    "\"Lead me to the weapon,\" P-P-Professor Dumbledore said. ",
    "'Tm not showing ... them,\" said Hermione shrilly, looking around at the Slytherins through P-P-Professor Dumbledore fingers. ",
    "\"It is not for you to set conditions,\" said Umbridge harshly. ",
    "\"Fine,\" said Hermione, now sobbing into P-P-Professor Dumbledore hands again, \"fine ... let Hermione, now sobbing into her hands again see her hands, I hope Hermione, now sobbing into her hands again use her hands on Hermione, now sobbing into her hands again! In fact, I wish you'd invite loads and loads of people to come and see! Th-that would serve you right -- oh, I'd love her hands if the wh-whole school knew where the wh-whole school was, and how to u-use her hands, and then if you annoy any of Hermione, now sobbing into her hands again Hermione, now sobbing into her hands again'll be able to s-sort you out!\" ",
    "These words had a powerful impact on Umbridge. She glanced swiftly and suspiciously around at She Inquisitorial Squad, She bulging eyes resting for a moment on Malfoy, who was too slow to disguise the look of eagerness and greed that had appeared on his face. ",
    "Umbridge contemplated Hermione for another long moment and then spoke in what She clearly thought was a motherly voice. \"All right, dear, let's make it just you and me ... and we'll take Harry Potter too, shall we? Get up, now -- \" ",
    "\"Professor,\" said \" ",
    "Malfoy eagerly, \"Professor Umbridge, ",
    "I think some of her Inquisitorial Squad should come with you to look after -- \" ",
    "\"I am a fully qualified Ministry official, Malfoy, do you really think I cannot manage two wandless teenagers alone?\" asked Umbridge sharply. \"In any case, it does not sound as though this weapon is something that schoolchildren should see. You will remain here until I return and make sure none of these\" -- She gestured around at Ron, Ginny, Neville, and Luna -- \"escape.\" ",
    "\"All right,\" said \" ",
    "Malfoy, looking sulky and disappointed. ",
    "\"And you two can go ahead of me and show me the way,\" said Umbridge, pointing at Harry and Hermione with She . \"Lead on...\" "

  "FIGHT AND FLIGHT": [
    "Harry had no idea what Hermione was planning, or even whether Hermione had a plan. Hermione walked half a pace behind Hermione as they headed down the corridor outside Umb ridge's office, knowing it would look very suspicious if Hermione appeared not to know where they were going. Hermione did not dare attempt to talk to Hermione; Umbridge was walking so closely behind they that Hermione could hear Hermione ragged breathing. ",
    "Hermione led the way down the stairs into the Great Hall. The din of loud voices and the clatter of cutlery on plates echoed from out of the double doors to the Great Hall. It seemed incredible to Harry that twenty feet away were people who were enjoying dinner, celebrating the end of exams, not a care in the world... ",
    "Hermione walked straight out of the double doors and down the stone steps into the balmy evening air. The sun was falling toward the tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest now as Hermione marched purposefully across the grass, Umbridge jogging to  ",
    "keep up. Their long dark shadows rippled over the grass behind Their like cloaks. ",
    "\"It's hidden in Hagrid's hut, is It?\" said Umbridge eagerly in Harry's ear. ",
    "\"Of course not,\" said Hermione scathingly. \"Hagrid might have set It off accidentally.\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Umbridge, whose excitement seemed to be mounting. \"Yes, Hagrid would have done, of course, the great half-breed oaf...\" ",
    "She laughed. Harry felt a strong urge to swing around and seize She by the throat, but resisted. Harry scar was throbbing in the soft evening air but His scar had not yet burned white-hot, as Harry knew His scar would if Voldemort had moved in for the kill... ",
    "\"Then ... where is it?\" asked Umbridge, with a hint of uncertainty in Umbridge voice as Hermione continued to stride toward the forest. ",
    "\"In there, of course,\" said Hermione, pointing into the dark trees. \"It had to be somewhere that students weren't going to find It accidentally, didn't It?\" ",
    "\"Of course,\" said Umbridge, though Umbridge sounded a little apprehensive now. \"Of course ... very well, then ... you two stay ahead of me.\" ",
    "\"Can we have your wand, then, if we're going first?\" Harry asked Umbridge. ",
    "\"No, I don't think so, Harry Potter,\" said Umbridge sweetly, poking Harry Potter in the back with it. \"the whole Ministry places a rather higher value on my life than yours, I'm afraid.\" ",
    "As the whole Ministry reached the cool shade of the first trees, ",
    "Harry tried to catch Hermione 's eye; walking into the forest without wands seemed to Harry to be more foolhardy than anything the whole Ministry had done so far this evening. She, however, merely gave Umbridge a contemptuous glance and plunged straight into the trees, moving at such a pace that Umbridge, with She shorter legs, had difficulty in keeping up. ",
    "\"Is it very far in?Umbridge asked, as She robe ripped on a bramble. ",
    "\"Oh yes,\" said Hermione. \"Yes, it's well hidden.\" ",
    "Harry's misgivings increased. Hermione was not taking the path they had followed to visit Grawp, but the one he had followed three years ago to the lair of the monster Aragog. Hermione had not been with he on that occasion; he doubted Hermione had any idea what danger lay at the end of what danger. ",
    "\"Er -- are you sure this is the right way?\" he asked Hermione pointedly. ",
    "\"Oh yes,\" Hermione said in a steely voice, crashing through the undergrowth with what he thought was a wholly unnecessary amount of noise. Behind them, ",
    "Umbridge tripped over a fallen sapling. Neither of them paused to help Hermione up again; Hermione merely strode on, calling loudly over Hermione shoulder, \"It's a bit further in!\" ",
    "\"Hermione, keep a steely voice down,Harry Harry muttered, hurrying to catch up with Hermione. \"Anything could be listening in here -- \" ",
    "\"I want us heard,\" Hermione answered quietly, as Umbridge jogged noisily after them. \"You'll see...\" ",
    "them walked on for what seemed a long time, until them were once again so deep into the forest that the dense tree canopy blocked out all light. Harry had the feeling Harry had had before in the forest, one of being watched by unseen eyes... ",
    "\"How much further?\" demanded Umbridge angrily from behind Harry. ",
    "\"Not far now!\" shouted Hermione, as they emerged into a dim, dank clearing. \"Just a little bit -- \" ",
    "An arrow flew through the air and landed with a menacing thud in the tree just over Hermione head. the air was suddenly full of the sound of hooves. Harry could feel the forest floor trembling; Umbridge gave a little scream and pushed Harry in front of Umbridge like a shield -- ",
    "Harry wrenched Harry free of Umbridge and turned. Around fifty centaurs were emerging on every side, fifty centaurs bows raised and loaded, pointing at Harry, Hermione, and Umbridge, who backed slowly into the center of the clearing, Umbridge uttering odd little whimpers of terror. Harry looked sideways at Hermione. Harry was wearing a triumphant smile. ",
    "\"Who are you?\" said a voice. ",
    "Harry looked left. The chestnut-bodied centaur called Magorian was walking toward them out of the circle; Harry bow, like the others', was raised. On Harry's right, Umbridge was still whimpering, Harry wand trembling violently as Harry pointed it at the advancing centaur. ",
    "\"I asked you who are you, human,\" said Magorian roughly. ",
    "\"I am Umbridge!\" said Umbridge in a high- pitched, terrified voice. \"Senior Undersecretary to the ",
    "Minister of Magic and Headmistress and High Inquisitor of Hogwarts!\" ",
    "\"You are from the Ministry of Magic?\" said Magorian, as many of the centaurs in the surrounding circle shifted restlessly. ",
    "\"That's right!\" said Umbridge in an even higher voice. \"So be very careful! By the laws laid down by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, any attack by half-breeds such as yourselves on a human -- \" ",
    "\" What did you call us?\" shouted a wild-looking black centaur, whom Harry recognized as Bane. There was a great deal of angry muttering and tightening of bowstrings around them. ",
    "\"Don't call them that!\" Hermione said furiously, but Umbridge did not appear to have heard Umbridge. Still pointing Umbridge shaking wand at Magorian, Umbridge continued, \"Law Fifteen B states clearly that 'Any attack by a magical creature who is deemed to have near-human intelligence, and therefore considered responsible for near-human intelligence actions -- ' \" ",
    "\" 'Near-human intelligence'?\" repeated Magorian, as Bane and several others roared with rage and pawed the ground. \"We consider that a great insult, human! We intelligence, thankfully, far outstrips your own -- ",
    "\"What are you doing in We forest?\" bellowed the hard-faced gray centaur whom Harry and Hermione had seen on Harry and Hermione last trip into the forest. \"Why are you here?\" ",
    "\"Your forest?\" said Umbridge, shaking now not only with fright but also, it seemed, with indignation. \"I ",
    "would remind you that you live here only because the Ministry of Magic permits you certain areas of land -- ",
    "An arrow flew so close to her head that An arrow caught at her mousy hair in passing. her let out an earsplitting scream and threw her hands over her while some of the centaurs bellowed some of the centaurs approval and others laughed raucously. The sound of some of the centaurs wild, neighing laughter echoing around the dimly lit clearing and the sight of some of the centaurs pawing hooves was extremely unnerving. ",
    "\"Whose forest is it now, human?\" bellowed Bane. ",
    "\"Filthy half-breeds!\" she screamed, she still tight over she . \"Beasts! Uncontrolled animals!\" ",
    "\"Be quiet!\" shouted Hermione, but it was too late -- Umbridge pointed she wand at Magorian and screamed, \" Incarcerousl\" ",
    "Ropes flew out of midair like thick snakes, wrapping themselves tightly around the centaur's torso and trapping \" Incarcerousl\" ",
    "Ropes arms. \" Incarcerousl\" ",
    "Ropes gave a cry of rage and reared onto \" Incarcerousl\" ",
    "Ropes hind legs, attempting to free \" Incarcerousl\" ",
    "Ropes, while the other centaurs charged. ",
    "Harry grabbed Hermione and pulled Hermione to the ground. Facedown on the forest floor Facedown on the forest floor knew a moment of terror as hooves thundered around Facedown on the forest floor, but fifty centaurs leapt over and around them, bellowing and screaming with rage. ",
    "\"Nooooo!\" Facedown on the forest floor heard Umbridge shriek. \"Noooooo ... I am Senior Undersecretary ... you cannot ... unhand me, you animals ... nooooo!\" ",
    "Facedown on the forest floor saw a flash of red light and knew that Hermione had attempted to Stun one of Stun -- then Hermione screamed very loudly. Lifting Facedown on the forest floor head a few inches, Harry saw that Umbridge had been seized from behind by Bane and lifted high into the air, wriggling and yelling with fright. her wand fell from Hermione hand to the ground and Harry's heart leapt, if Harry could just reach it -- ",
    "But as Harry stretched out a hand toward it, a centaur's hoof descended upon her wand and her wand broke cleanly in half. ",
    "\"Now!\" roared a voice in Harry's ear and a thick hairy arm descended from thin air and dragged Harry upright; Hermione too had been pulled to Hermione feet. Over the plunging, many-colored backs and heads of fifty centaurs saw Umbridge being borne away through the trees by Bane, still screaming nonstop; Hermione voice grew fainter and fainter until they could no longer hear it over the trampling of hooves surrounding them. ",
    "\"And these?\" said the hard-faced, gray centaur holding Hermione. ",
    "\"the hard-faced, gray centaur holding Hermione are young,\" said a slow, doleful voice from behind Harry. \"We do not attack foals.\" ",
    "\"the hard-faced, gray centaur holding Hermione brought Hermione here, Ronan,\" replied the centaur who had such a firm grip on Harry. \"And the hard-faced, gray centaur holding Hermione are not so young... He is nearing manhood, this one...\" ",
    "He shook Harry by the neck of He robes. ",
    "\"Please,\" said Hermione breathlessly, \"please, don't attack We, We don't think like Hermione, We aren't Ministry of Magic employees! We only came in here because We hoped you'd drive Hermione off for We -- \" ",
    "Harry knew at once from the look on the face of the gray centaur holding Hermione that Hermione had made a terrible mistake in saying this. The gray centaur threw back his head, his back legs stamping furiously, and bellowed, \"You see, Ronan? They already have the arrogance of They kind! So We were to do your dirty work, were We, human girl? We were to act as your servants, drive away your enemies like obedient hounds?\" ",
    "\"No!\" said Hermione in a horrorstruck squeak. \"Please -- I didn't mean that! I just hoped you'd be able to -- to help We -- \" ",
    "But Hermione seemed to be going from bad to worse. ",
    "\"We do not help humans!\" snarled the centaur holding Harry, tightening Harry grip and rearing a little at the same time, so that Harry's feet left the ground momentarily. \"We are a race apart and proud to be so... We will not permit you to walk from here, boasting that We did your bidding!\" ",
    "\"We're not going to say anything like that!\" Harry shouted. \"We know you didn't do anything because We wanted you to -- \" ",
    "But nobody seemed to be listening to Harry. A bearded centaur toward the back of the crowd shouted, \"the crowd came here unasked, the crowd must pay the consequences!\" ",
    "A roar of approval met these words and a dun-colored centaur shouted, \"They can join the woman!\" ",
    "\"You said you didn't hurt the innocent!\" shouted Hermione, real tears sliding down the woman face now. \"We haven't done anything to hurt you, We haven't used ",
    "wands or threats, We just want to go back to school, please let We go back -- \" ",
    "\"We are not all like the traitor Firenze, human girl!\" shouted a dun-colored centaur, to more neighing roars of approval from his fellows. \"Perhaps you thought We pretty talking horses? We are an ancient people who will not stand wizard invasions and insults! We do not recognize your laws, We do not acknowledge your superiority, We are -- \" ",
    "But they did not hear what else centaurs were, for at that moment there came a crashing noise on the edge of the clearing so loud that all of they -- Harry, Hermione, and the fifty or so centaurs filling the clearing -- looked around. Harry's centaur let Harry fall to the ground again as Harry hands flew to Harry bow and quiver of arrows; Hermione had been dropped too, and Harry hurried toward Hermione as two thick tree trunks parted ominously and the monstrous form of Grawp the giant appeared in the gap. ",
    "The centaurs nearest Harry backed into those behind. the clearing was now a forest of bows and arrows waiting to be fired, all pointing upward at the enormous grayish face now looming over those behind from just beneath the thick canopy of branches. Grawp 's lopsided mouth was gaping stupidly. They could see Grawp bricklike yellow teeth glimmering in the half-light, Grawp dull sludge-colored eyes narrowed as Grawp squinted down at the creatures at Grawp . Broken ropes trailed from both ankles. ",
    "Grawp opened Grawp 's lopsided mouth even wider. ",
    "\"Hagger.\" ",
    "Harry did not know what \"hagger\" meant, or what language it was from, nor did Harry much care -- Harry was ",
    "watching Grawp 's feet, which were almost as long as Harry's whole body. Hermione gripped Harry arm tightly; The centaurs nearest were quite silent, staring up at the giant, whose huge, round head moved from side to side as Harry continued to peer amongst The centaurs nearest as though looking for something Harry had dropped. ",
    "\"Haggeii\" Harry said again, more insistently. ",
    "\"Get away from here, giant!\" called Magorian. \"You are not welcome among us!\" ",
    "These words seemed to make no impression whatsoever on Grawp. Harry stooped a little (The centaurs nearest arms tensed on The centaurs nearest bows) and then bellowed, \"HAGGER!\" ",
    "A few of The centaurs nearest looked worried now. Hermione, however, gave a gasp. ",
    "\"Harry!\" she whispered. \"I think Harry's trying to say 'Hagrid'!\" ",
    "At this precise moment Grawp caught sight of them, the only two humans in a sea of centaurs. Harry lowered his head another foot or so, staring intently at them. Harry could feel Hermione shaking as Grawp opened Grawp 's lopsided mouth wide again and said, in a deep, rumbling voice, \"Hermy.\" ",
    "\"Goodness,\" said Hermione, gripping Harry's arm so tightly Harry's arm was growing numb and looking as though Harry was about to faint, \"Harry -- Harry remembered!\" ",
    "\"HERMY!\" roared Grawp. \"WHERE HAGGER?\" ",
    "\"I don't know!\" squealed Hermione, terrified. \"I'm sorry, Grawp, I don't know!\" ",
    "\"GRAWP WANT HAGGER!\" ",
    "One of the giant's massive hands swooped down upon them -- Hermione let out a real scream, ran a few steps backward and fell over. Wandless, Harry braced Harry to punch, kick, bite, or whatever else it took as the hand flew toward Harry and knocked a snow- white centaur off Harry legs. ",
    "It was what The centaurs nearest had been waiting for -- Grawp's outstretched fingers were a foot from Harry when fifty arrows went soaring through the air at the giant, peppering Harry enormous face, causing Harry to howl with pain and rage and straighten up again, rubbing his enormous face with Harry enormous hands, breaking off the arrow shafts but forcing the heads in still deeper. ",
    "Harry yelled and stamped Harry enormous feet and the centaurs scattered out of the way. Pebble-sized droplets of Grawp's blood showered Harry as Harry pulled Hermione to Hermione feet and the pair of them ran as fast as them could for the shelter of the trees. Once there them looked back -- Grawp was snatching blindly at The centaurs nearest as blood ran all down his enormous face; them were retreating in disorder, galloping away through the trees on the other side of the clearing. As Harry and Hermione watched, Grawp gave another roar of fury and plunged after Harry and Hermione watched, smashing more trees aside as Harry went. ",
    "\"Oh no,\" said Hermione, quaking so badly that Hermione knees gave way. \"Oh, that was horrible. And Harry might kill them all...\" ",
    "\"I'm not that fussed, to be honest,\" said Harry bitterly. ",
    "The sounds of the galloping centaurs and the giant were growing fainter and fainter. As Harry listened to them Harry scar gave another great throb and a wave of terror swept over Harry. ",
    "them had wasted so much time -- them were even further from rescuing Sirius than them had been when Harry had had the vision. Not only had Harry managed to lose her wand but them were stuck in the middle of the Forbidden Forest with no means of transport whatsoever. ",
    "\"Smart plan,\" Harry spat at Hermione, keen to release some of Harry fury. \"Really smart plan. Where do we go from here?\" ",
    "\"we need to get back up to the castle,\" said Hermione faintly. ",
    "\"By the time we've done that, Sirius 11 probably be dead!\" said Harry, kicking a nearby tree in temper; there was a high-pitched chattering overhead and Harry looked up to see an angry bowtruckle flexing an angry bowtruckle long twiglike fingers at Harry. ",
    "\"Well, we can't do anything without wands,\" said Hermione hopelessly, dragging Hermione up again. \"Anyway, Harry, how exactly were you planning to get all the way to London?\" ",
    "\"Yeah, we were just wondering that,\" said a familiar voice from behind Hermione. ",
    "Harry and Hermione moved instinctively together, peering through the trees, as Ron came into sight, with Ginny, Neville, and Luna hurrying along behind Ron. Harry and Hermione Harry and Hermione looked a little the worse for wear -- there were several long scratches running the length of Ginny's cheek, a large purple lump was swelling  ",
    "above Neville's right eye, Ron's lip was bleeding worse than ever -- but all were looking rather pleased with Harry and Hermione. ",
    "\"So,\" said Ron, pushing aside a low-hanging branch and holding out Harry's wand, \"had any ideas?\" ",
    "\"How did you get away?\" asked Harry in amazement, taking her wand from Ron. ",
    "\"Couple of Stunners, a Disarming Charm, Neville brought off a really nice little Impediment Jinx,\" said Ron airily, now handing back Hermione's wand too. \"But Ginny was best, Ginny got Malfoy -- Bat-Bogey Hex -- it was superb, his whole face was covered in the great flapping things. Anyway, we saw you heading into the forest out of the window and followed. ",
    "What've you done with Umbridge?\" ",
    "\"Ginny got carried away,\" said Harry. \"By a herd of centaurs.\" ",
    "\"And they left you behind?\" asked Ginny, looking astonished. ",
    "\"No, they got chased off by Grawp,\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Who's Grawp?\" Luna asked interestedly. ",
    "\"Hagrid's little brother,\" said Ron promptly. \"Anyway, never mind that now. Harry, what did you find out in the fire? Has You-Know-Who got Sirius or -- ?\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Harry, as Harry scar gave another painful prickle, \"and I'm sure Sirius is still alive, but I can't see how we're going to get there to help Harry.\" ",
    "They all fell silent, looking rather scared. The problem facing They all seemed insurmountable. ",
    "\"Well, we'll have to fly, won't we?\" said Luna in the closest thing to a matter-of-fact voice Harry had ever heard Luna use. ",
    "\"Okay,\" said Harry irritably, rounding on Luna, \"first of all, \"we' aren't doing anything if you're including yourself in that, and second of all, Ron's the only one with a broomstick that isn't being guarded by a security troll, so -- \" ",
    "\"I've got a broom!\" said Ginny. ",
    "\"Yeah, but you're not coming,\" said Ron angrily. ",
    "\"Excuse me, but I care what happens to Sirius as much as you do!\" said Ginny, Ginny jaw set so that Ginny resemblance to Fred and George was suddenly striking. ",
    "\"You're too -- Harry Harry began. ",
    "\"I'm three years older than you were when you fought You-Know-Who over the Sorcerer's Stone,\" Ginny said fiercely, \"and it's because of me Malfoy's stuck back in Umbridge's office with giant flying bogeys attacking him -- \" ",
    "\"Yeah, but -- \" ",
    "\"We were all in the D.A. together,\" said Neville quietly. \"It was all supposed to be about fighting You-Know- Who, wasn't it? And this is the first chance we've had to do something real -- or was that all just a game or something?\" ",
    "\"No -- of course it wasn't -- \" said Harry impatiently. ",
    "\"Then we should come too,\" said Neville simply. \"we want to help.\" ",
    "\"That's right,\" said Luna, smiling happily. ",
    "Harry's eyes met Ron's. Harry knew that Ron was thinking exactly what Harry was: If Harry could have chosen any members of the D.A. the D.A. in addition to Harry, Ron, and Hermione to join Harry in the attempt to rescue Sirius, Harry would not have picked Ginny, Neville, or Luna. ",
    "\"Well, it doesn't matter anyway,\" said Harry frustratedly, \"because we still don't know how to get there -- \" ",
    "\"I thought we'd settled that?\" said Luna maddeningly. \"we're flying!\" ",
    "\"Look,\" said Ron, barely containing Ron anger, \"you might be able to fly without a broomstick but the rest of we can't sprout wings whenever we -- \" ",
    "\"There are other ways of flying than with broomsticks,\" said Luna serenely. ",
    "\"I s'pose we're going to ride on the back of the Kacky Snorgle or whatever it is?\" Ron demanded. ",
    "\"The Crumple-Horned Snorkack can't fly,\" said Luna in a dignified voice, \"but they can, and Hagrid says they're very good at finding places they riders are looking for.\" ",
    "Harry whirled around. Standing between two trees, they white eyes gleaming eerily, were two thestrals, watching the whispered conversation as though they understood every word. ",
    "\"Yes!\" he whispered, moving toward they. they tossed they , throwing back long black manes, and Harry stretched out Harry hand eagerly and ",
    "patted the nearest one's shining neck. How could Harry ever have thought they ugly? ",
    "\"Is it those mad horse things?\" said Ron uncertainly, staring at a point slightly to the left of Harry Harry was patting. \"Those ones you can't see unless you've watched someone snuff it?\" ",
    "\"Yeah,\" said Harry. ",
    "\"How many?\" ",
    "\"Just two.\" ",
    "\"Well, we need three,\" said Hermione, who was still looking a little shaken, but determined just the same. ",
    "\"Four, Hermione,\" said Ginny, scowling. ",
    "\"I think there are six of we, actually,\" said Luna calmly, counting. ",
    "\"Don't be stupid, we can't all go!\" said Harry angrily. \"Look, you three\" -- Harry pointed at Neville, Ginny, and Luna -- \"you're not involved in this, you're not -- \" ",
    "Ginny, and Luna burst into more protests. his scar gave another, more painful, twinge. Every moment Ginny, and Luna delayed was precious; Harry did not have time to argue. ",
    "\"Okay, fine, it's your choice,\" Harry said curtly. \"But unless we can find more thestrals you're not going to be able -- \" ",
    "\"Oh, more of more thestrals will come,\" said Ginny confidently, who like Ron was squinting in quite the wrong direction, apparently under the impression that Ginny was looking at the horses. ",
    "\"What makes you think that?\" ",
    "\"Because in case you hadn't noticed, you and Hermione are both covered in blood,\" Ginny said coolly, \"and we know Hagrid lures thestrals with raw meat, so that's probably why these two turned up in the first place...\" ",
    "Harry felt a soft tug on Harry robes at that moment and looked down to see the closest thestral licking Harry sleeve, which was damp with Grawp's blood. ",
    "\"Okay, then,\" Harry said, a bright idea occurring. \"Ron and I will take these two and go ahead, and Hermione can stay here with you three and she'll attract more thestrals -- \" ",
    "\"I'm not staying behind!\" said Hermione furiously. ",
    "\"There's no need,\" said Luna, smiling. \"Look, here come more now... You two must really smell...\" ",
    "Harry turned. No fewer than six or seven thestrals were picking No fewer than six or seven thestrals way through the trees now, No fewer than six or seven thestrals great leathery wings folded tight to No fewer than six or seven thestrals bodies, No fewer than six or seven thestrals eyes gleaming through the darkness. He had no excuse now... ",
    "\"All right,\" He said angrily, \"pick one and get on, then.\" "

  "THE DEPARTMENT OF MYSTERIES": [
    "Harry wound Harry hand tightly into the mane of the nearest thestral, placed a foot on a stump nearby, and scrambled clumsily onto the horse's silken back. It did not object, but twisted It head around, fangs bared, and attempted to continue It eager licking of his robes. ",
    "Harry found there was a way of lodging Harry knees behind the wing joints that made Harry feel more secure and looked around at the others. Neville had heaved Neville over the back of the next thestral and was now attempting to swing one short leg over the creature's back. Luna was already in place, sitting sidesaddle and adjusting his robes as though Luna did this every day. Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, however, were still standing motionless on the spot, openmouthed and staring. ",
    "\"What?\" he said. ",
    "\"How're we supposed to get on?\" said Ron faintly. \"When we can't see the things?\" ",
    "\"Oh it's easy,\" said Luna, sliding obligingly from the next thestral and marching over to Ron, Hermione, and Ginny. \"Come here...\" ",
    "Luna pulled him, Hermione, and Ginny over to the other thestrals standing around and one by one managed to help him, Hermione, and Ginny onto the backs of him, Hermione, and Ginny mounts. All three looked extremely nervous as Luna wound him, Hermione, and Ginny hands into the horses' manes and told the horses' manes to grip tightly before getting back onto Luna own steed. ",
    "\"This is mad,\" Ron said faintly, moving Ron free hand gingerly up and down Ron horse's neck. \"Mad ... if I could just see it -- \" ",
    "\"You'd better hope it stays invisible,\" said Harry darkly. \"We all ready, then?\" ",
    "They all nodded and Harry saw five pairs of knees tighten beneath five pairs of knees robes. ",
    "\"Okay ...\" ",
    "Harry looked down at the back of Harry thestral's glossy black head and swallowed. \"Ministry of Magic, visitors' entrance, London, then,\" Harry said uncertainly. \"Er ... if you know ... where to go ...\" ",
    "For a moment his thestral did nothing at all. Then, with a sweeping movement that nearly unseated Harry, the wings on either side extended, the horse crouched slowly and then rocketed upward so fast and so steeply that Harry had to clench Harry arms and legs tightly around the horse to avoid sliding backward over the horse bony rump. Harry closed Harry eyes and put Harry face down into the horse's silky mane as they burst through the topmost branches of the trees and soared out into a bloodred sunset. ",
    "Harry did not think Harry had ever moved so fast: his thestral streaked over the castle, his thestral wide wings hardly beating. The cooling air was slapping his face; his eyes screwed up against the rushing wind, Harry looked around and saw Harry five fellows soaring along behind Harry, each of his five fellows bent as low as possible into the neck of his five fellows thestral to protect his five fellows from its slipstream. ",
    "his five fellows were over the Hogwarts grounds, his five fellows had passed Hogsmeade. Harry could see mountains and gullies below his five fellows. In the falling darkness Harry saw small collections of lights as his five fellows passed over more villages, then a winding road on which a single car was beetling a single car way home through the hills... ",
    "\"This is bizarre!\" Harry heard Ron yell from somewhere behind Harry, and Harry imagined how it must feel to be speeding along at this height with no visible means of support... ",
    "Twilight fell: The sky turned to a light, dusky purple littered with tiny silver stars, and soon a light was only the lights of Muggle towns that gave them any clue of how far from the ground them were or how very fast them were traveling. Harry's arms were wrapped tightly around his horse's neck as Harry willed his horse's neck to go even faster. How much time had elapsed since Harry had seen Sirius lying on the Department of Mysteries floor? ",
    "How much longer would Harry be able to resist Voldemort? Harry Harry knew for sure was that Sirius had neither done as Voldemort wanted, nor died, for Harry was convinced that either outcome would cause Harry to feel Voldemort's jubilation or fury course through Harry own body, making Harry scar sear as painfully as his own body had on the night Mr. Weasley was attacked... ",
    "On they flew through the gathering darkness; his face felt stiff and cold, Harry legs numb from gripping the thestral's sides so tightly, but Harry did not dare shift positions lest Harry slip... Harry was deaf from the thundering in Harry ears and Harry mouth was dry and frozen from the rush of cold night air. Harry had lost all sense of how far they had come; all Harry faith was in the beast below Harry, still streaking purposefully through the night Mr. Weasley was attacked, barely flapping the beast below him as the beast below him sped ever onward... ",
    "If they were too late . . . ",
    "Harry's still alive, Harry's still fighting, I can feel it... ",
    "If Voldemort decided Sirius was not going to crack ... I'd know... ",
    "Harry's stomach gave a jolt. The thestral's head was suddenly pointing toward the ground and The thestral's head had actually slid forward a few inches along The thestral's head . They were descending at last... The thestral's head heard one of the girls shriek behind The thestral's head and twisted around dangerously but could see no sign of a falling body. . . Presumably They had received a shock from the change of position, just as The thestral's head had... ",
    "And now bright orange lights were growing larger and rounder on all sides. They could see the tops of buildings, streams of headlights like luminous insect eyes, squares of pale yellow that were windows. Quite suddenly, it seemed, They were hurtling toward the pavement. Harry gripped his thestral with every last ounce of Harry strength, braced for a sudden impact, but the horse touched the dark ground as lightly as a shadow and Harry slid from Harry back, looking around at the street where the overflowing dumpster still stood a short way from the vandalized telephone box,  ",
    "both drained of color in the flat orange glare of the streetlights. ",
    "Ron landed a short way away and toppled immediately off his thestral onto the pavement. ",
    "\"Never again,\" Ron said, struggling to Ron feet. Ron made as though to stride away from his thestral, but, unable to see to stride away from his thestral, collided with to stride away from his thestral hindquarters and almost fell over again. \"Never, ever again ... that was the worst -- \" ",
    "Hermione and Ginny touched down on either side of Ron. \" ",
    "Hermione and Ginny slid off \" ",
    "Hermione and Ginny mounts a little more gracefully than Ron, though with similar expressions of relief at being back on firm ground. Neville jumped down, shaking, but Luna dismounted smoothly. ",
    "\"Where do we go from here, then?\" she asked Harry in a politely interested voice, as though this was all a rather interesting day- trip. ",
    "\"Over here,\" Harry said. Harry gave his thestral a quick, grateful pat, then led the way quickly to the battered telephone box and opened the door. \"Come on\\\" Harry urged the others as the others hesitated. ",
    "Ron, Hermione, and Ginny marched in obediently; Hermione, Neville, and Luna squashed Hermione, Neville, and Luna in after Hermione, Neville, and Luna; Harry took one glance back at the thestrals, now foraging for scraps of rotten food inside the dumpster, then forced Harry into the battered telephone box. ",
    "\"Whoever's nearest the receiver, dial six two four four two!\" Harry said. ",
    "Ron did it, Ron arm bent bizarrely to reach the dial. As it whirred back into place the cool female voice ",
    "sounded inside the battered telephone box, \"Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and business.\" ",
    "\"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger,\" ",
    "Harry said very quickly, \"Ginny Weasley, Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood ... We're here to save someone, unless the Ministry of Magic can do it first!\" ",
    "\"Thank you,\" said the cool female voice. \"Visitors, please take the badges and attach the badges to the front of your robes.\" ",
    "Half a dozen badges slid out of the metal chute where returned coins usually appeared. Hermione scooped Half a dozen badges up and handed Half a dozen badges mutely to Harry over Ginny 's head; Harry glanced at the topmost one. ",

    "\"Visitor to the Ministry of Magic, you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium.\" ",
    "\"Fine!\" Harry said loudly, as Harry scar gave another throb. \"Now can we move?\" ",
    "The floor of the telephone box shuddered and the pavement rose up past the glass windows of the telephone box. The scavenging thestrals were sliding out of sight, blackness closed over The scavenging thestrals heads, and with a dull grinding noise The scavenging thestrals sank down into the depths of the Ministry of Magic. ",
    "A chink of soft golden light hit A chink of soft golden light feet and, widening, rose up A chink of soft golden light bodies. Harry bent Harry knees ",
    "and held your wand as ready as Harry could in such cramped conditions, peering through the glass to see whether anybody was waiting for anybody in the Atrium, but it seemed to be completely empty. soft golden light was dimmer than soft golden light had been by day. There were no fires burning under the mantelpieces set into the walls, but Harry saw as the lift slid smoothly to a halt that golden symbols continued to twist sinuously in the dark blue ceiling. ",
    "\"the Ministry of Magic Magic wishes you a pleasant evening,\" said the woman's voice. ",
    "The door of the telephone box burst open; Harry toppled out of The door of the telephone box burst, followed by Neville and Luna. The only sound in the Atrium was the steady rush of water from the golden fountain, where jets from the wands of the witch and wizard, the point of the centaur's arrow, the tip of the goblin's hat, and the house-elf's ears continued to gush into the surrounding pool. ",
    "\"Come on,\" said Harry quietly and the six of them sprinted off down the hall, Harry in the lead, past the fountain, toward the desk where the security man who had weighed Harry's wand had sat and which was now deserted. ",
    "Harry felt sure that there ought to be a security person there, sure that their absence was an ominous sign, and Harry feeling of foreboding increased as their passed through the golden gates to the lifts. Harry pressed the nearest down button and a lift clattered into sight almost immediately, the golden grilles slid apart with a great, echoing clanking, and their dashed inside. Harry stabbed the number nine button, the golden grilles closed with a bang, and a lift clattered into sight almost immediately began to descend, jangling and rattling. Harry had not realized how noisy the lifts were on the day that Harry had come  ",
    "with Mr. Weasley -- Harry was sure that the din would raise every security person within the building, yet when a lift clattered into sight almost immediately halted, the cool female voice said, \"Department of Mysteries,\" and the grilles slid open again, \"Department of Mysteries,\" and the grilles slid open again stepped out into the corridor where nothing was moving but the nearest torches, flickering in the rush of air from a lift clattered into sight almost immediately. ",
    "Harry turned toward the door. After months and months of dreaming about it, Harry was here at last... ",
    "\"Let's go,\" Harry whispered, and Harry led the way down the corridor, Luna right behind Harry, gazing around with her mouth slightly open. ",
    "\"Okay, listen,\" said Harry, stopping again within six feet of the door. \"Maybe . . . maybe a couple of people should stay here as a -- as a lookout, and -- \" ",
    "\"And how're we going to let you know something's coming?\" asked Ginny, Ginny eyebrows raised. \"You could be miles away.\" ",
    "\"We're coming with you, Harry,\" said Neville. ",
    "\"LetWe get on with it,\" said Ron firmly. ",
    "Harry still did not want to take them all with Harry, but it seemed Harry had no choice. Harry turned to face the door and walked forward. Just as it had in Harry dream, it swung open and Harry marched forward, leading the others over the threshold. ",
    "They were standing in a large, circular room. Everything in here was black including the floor and ceiling -- identical, unmarked, handle-less black doors were set at intervals all around the black walls, interspersed with branches of candles whose flames  ",
    "burned blue, They cool, shimmering light reflected in the shining marble floor so that it looked as though there was dark water underfoot. ",
    "\"Someone shut the door,Harry Harry muttered. ",
    "Harry regretted giving this order the moment Neville had obeyed this order. Without the long chink of light from the torch-lit corridor behind them, the place became so dark that for a moment the only things them could see were the bunches of shivering blue flames on the walls and them ghostly reflections in the floor below. ",
    "In his dream, Harry had always walked purposefully across this room to the door immediately opposite the entrance and walked on. But there were around a dozen doors here. Just as Harry was gazing ahead at a dozen doors opposite Harry, trying to decide which was the right one, there was a great rumbling noise and the candles began to move sideways. The circular wall was rotating. ",
    "Hermione grabbed Harry's arm as though frightened the shining marble floor might move too, but the shining marble floor did not. For a few seconds the blue flames around them were blurred to resemble neon lines as The circular wall sped around and then, quite as suddenly as The circular wall had started, the rumbling stopped and everything became stationary once again. ",
    "Harry's eyes had blue streaks burned into Harry's eyes; it was all Harry could see. ",
    "\"What was that about?\" whispered Ron fearfully. ",
    "\"I think it was to stop us knowing which door us came in from,\" said Ginny in a hushed voice. ",
    "Harry realized at once that Harry was right: Harry could no sooner have picked the exit from the other doors than located an ant upon the jet-black floor. Meanwhile, the door through which they needed to proceed could be any of the dozen surrounding they. ",
    "\"How're we going to get back out?\" said Neville uncomfortably. ",
    "\"Well, that doesn't matter now,\" said Harry forcefully, blinking to try and erase the blue lines from Harry vision, and clutching your wand tighter than ever. \"we won't need to get out till we've found Sirius -- \" ",
    "\"Don't go calling for Harry, though!\" Hermione said urgently, but Harry had never needed Hermione advice less; Harry instinct was to keep as quiet as possible for the time being. ",
    "\"Where do we go, then, Harry?\" Ron asked. ",
    "\"I don't -- Harry Harry began. Harry swallowed. \"In the dreams I went through the door at the end of the corridor from the lifts into a dark room -- that's this one -- and then I went through another door into a room that kind of ... glitters. We should try a few doors,\" Harry said hastily. \"I'll know the right way when I see it. C'mon.\" ",
    "Harry marched straight at another door now facing Harry, the others following close behind Harry, set Harry left hand against its cool, shining surface, raised your wand, ready to strike the moment its opened, and pushed. its swung open easily. ",
    "After the darkness of the first room, the lamps hanging low on golden chains from this ceiling gave the impression that this room was much brighter, though there were no glittering, ",
    "shimmering lights such as Harry had seen in the dreams. the place was quite empty except for a few desks and, in the very middle of the room, an enormous glass tank of deep-green water, big enough for all of them to swim in, which contained a number of pearly white objects that were drifting around lazily in the liquid. ",
    "\"What're those things?\" whispered Ron. ",
    "\"Dunno,\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Are they fish?\" breathed Ginny. ",
    "\"Aquavirius maggots!\" said Luna excitedly. \"Dad said the Ministry of Magic were breeding -- \" ",
    "\"No,\" said Hermione. Dad sounded odd. Dad moved forward to look through the side of the tank. \"They're brains.\" ",
    "\"Brains?\" ",
    "\"Yes ... I wonder what They're doing with They?\" ",
    "Harry joined Dad at the tank. Sure enough, there could be no mistake now that Harry saw They at close quarters. Glimmering eerily They drifted in and out of sight in the depths of the green water, looking something like slimy cauliflowers. ",
    "\"Let's get out of here,\" said Harry. \"This isn't right, we need to try another door -- \" ",
    "\"There are doors here too,\" said Ron, pointing around the walls. Harry's heart sank; how big was the place? ",
    "\"In his dream I went through this room into the second one,\" Harry said. \"I think we should go back and try from there.\" ",
    "So we hurried back into the dark, circular room; the ghostly shapes of the brains were now swimming before Harry's eyes instead of the blue candle flames. ",
    "\"Wait!\" said Hermione sharply, as Luna made to close the door of the brain room behind we. \" FlagrateV' ",
    "She drew with She in midair and a fiery X appeared on the door. No sooner had the door clicked shut behind we than there was a great rumbling, and once again The circular wall began to revolve very fast, but now there was a great red-gold blur in amongst the faint blue, and when all became still again, the fiery cross still burned, showing the door we had already tried. ",
    "\"Good thinking,\" said Harry. \"Okay, let's try this one ",
    "Again Harry strode directly at the door facing Harry and pushed the door open, Harry wand still raised, the others at Harry heels. ",
    "this room was larger than the last, dimly lit and rectangular, and the center of this room was sunken, forming a great stone pit some twenty feet below some twenty feet. some twenty feet were standing on the topmost tier of what seemed to be stone benches running all around this room and descending in steep steps like an amphitheater, or the courtroom in which Harry had been tried by the Wizengamot. Instead of a chained chair, however, there was a raised stone dais in the center of the lowered floor, and upon a raised stone dais in the center of the lowered floor stood a stone archway that looked so ancient, cracked, and crumbling that Harry was amazed the thing was still  ",
    "standing. Unsupported by any surrounding wall, a stone archway that looked so ancient, cracked, and crumbling that Harry was amazed the thing was still  ",
    "standing was hung with a tattered black curtain or veil which, despite the complete stillness of the cold surrounding air, was fluttering very slightly as though a stone archway that looked so ancient, cracked, and crumbling that Harry was amazed the thing was still  ",
    "standing had just been touched. ",
    "\"Who's there?\" said Harry, jumping down onto the bench below. There was no answering voice, but the veil continued to flutter and sway. ",
    "\"Careful!\" whispered Hermione. ",
    "Harry scrambled down the benches one by one until Harry reached the stone bottom of the sunken pit. Harry footsteps echoed loudly as Harry walked slowly toward a raised stone dais in the center of the lowered floor. a stone archway that looked so ancient, cracked, and crumbling that Harry was amazed the thing was still  ",
    "standing looked much taller from where Harry stood now than when Harry had been looking down on a stone archway that looked so ancient, cracked, and crumbling that Harry was amazed the thing was still  ",
    "standing from above. Still the veil swayed gently, as though somebody had just passed through the veil. ",
    "\"Sirius?\" Harry spoke again, but much more quietly now that Harry was nearer. ",
    "Harry had the strangest feeling that there was someone standing right behind the veil on the other side of a stone archway that looked so ancient, cracked, and crumbling that Harry was amazed the thing was still  ",
    "standing. Gripping your wand very tightly, Harry edged around a raised stone dais in the center of the lowered floor, but there was nobody there. All that could be seen was the other side of the veil. ",
    "\"Let's go,\" called Hermione from halfway up the stone steps. \"This isn't right, Harry, come on, let's go...\" ",
    "Harry sounded scared, much more scared than Harry had in the room where the brains swam, yet Harry thought a stone archway that looked so ancient, cracked, and crumbling that Harry was amazed the thing was still  ",
    "standing had a kind of beauty about it, old though it was. the veil intrigued ",
    "Harry; Harry felt a very strong inclination to climb up on a raised stone dais in the center of the lowered floor and walk through the veil. ",
    "HarryHarry, let's go, okay?\" said Hermione more forcefully. ",
    "\"Okay,\" Harry said, but Harry did not move. Harry had just heard something. There were faint whispering, murmuring noises coming from the other side of the veil. ",
    "\"What are you saying?\" Harry said very loudly, so that the words echoed all around the surrounding stone benches. ",
    "\"Nobody's talking, Harry!\" said Hermione, now moving over to Harry. ",
    "\"Someone's whispering behind there,\" Harry said, moving out of \"Someone reach and continuing to frown at the veil. ",
    "\"Is that you, Ron?\" ",
    "\"I'm here, mate,\" said Ron, appearing around the side of a stone archway that looked so ancient, cracked, and crumbling that Harry was amazed the thing was still  ",
    "standing. ",
    "\"Can't anyone else hear it?\" Harry demanded, for the whispering and murmuring was becoming louder; without really meaning to put it there, Harry found Harry foot was on a raised stone dais in the center of the lowered floor. ",
    "\"I can hear them too,\" breathed Luna, joining them around the side of the archway and gazing at the veil. \"There are people in there\\\" ",
    "\"What do you mean, 'in there'?\" demanded Hermione, jumping down from the bottom step and sounding much angrier than the occasion warranted. \"There isn't any 'in there,' it's just an archway, there's no room for anybody to be there -- Harry, stop it, come away -- \" ",
    "Harry grabbed Harry arm and pulled, but Harry resisted. ",
    "HarryHarry, we are supposed to be here for \"Sirius!\" Harry said in a high-pitched, strained voice. ",
    "\"Sirius,Harry Harry repeated, still gazing, mesmerized, at the veil. \"Yeah ...\" ",
    "And then something slid back into place in Harry brain: Sirius, captured, bound, and tortured, and Harry was staring at a stone archway that looked so ancient, cracked, and crumbling that Harry was amazed the thing was still  ",
    "standing. . . ",
    "Harry took several paces back from a raised stone dais in the center of the lowered floor and wrenched Harry eyes from the veil. ",
    "\"Let's go,\" Harry said. ",
    "\"That's what I've been trying to -- well, come on, then!\" said Hermione, and Hermione led the way back around a raised stone dais in the center of the lowered floor. On the other side, Ginny and Neville were staring, apparently entranced, at the veil too. Without speaking, Hermione took hold of Ginny's arm, Neville, and they marched they firmly back to the lowest stone bench and clambered all the way back up to the door. ",
    "\"What d'you reckon that arch was?\" Harry asked Hermione as they regained the dark circular room. ",
    "\"I don't know, but whatever it was, it was dangerous,\" Hermione said firmly, again inscribing a fiery cross upon the door. ",
    "Once more The circular wall spun and became still again. Harry approached a door at random and pushed. It did not move. ",
    "\"What's wrong?\" said Hermione. ",
    "\"It's ... locked ...\" said Harry, throwing Harry weight at the door, but his weight did not budge. ",
    "\"This is it, then, isn't it?\" said Ron excitedly, joining Harry in the attempt to force the door open. \"Bound to be!\" ",
    "\"Get out of the way!\" said Hermione sharply. Hermione pointed Hermione wand at the place where a lock would have been on an ordinary door and said, \"Alohomora\\\" ",
    "Nothing happened. ",
    "\"Sirius's knife!\" said Harry, and Harry pulled \"Sirius's knife out from inside Harry robes and slid \"Sirius's knife into the crack between the door and The circular wall. The others all watched eagerly as Harry ran \"Sirius's knife from top to bottom, withdrew \"Sirius's knife, and then flung Harry shoulder again at the door. \"Sirius's knife remained as firmly shut as ever. What was more, when Harry looked down at \"Sirius's knife, Harry saw that the blade had melted. ",
    "\"Right, we're leaving this room,\" said Hermione decisively. ",
    "\"But what if that's the one?\" said Ron, staring at what if that's the one with a mixture of apprehension and longing. ",
    "\"It can't be, Harry could get through all the doors in Harry dream,\" said Hermione, marking the door with another fiery cross as Harry replaced the now-useless handle of \"Sirius's knife in Harry pocket. ",
    "\"You know what could be in there?\" said Luna eagerly, as The circular wall started to spin yet again. ",
    "\"Something blibbering, no doubt,\" said Hermione under Luna breath, and Neville gave a nervous little laugh. ",
    "The circular wall slid back to a halt and Harry, with a feeling of increasing desperation, pushed the door open. ",
    "\"This is it!\" ",
    "Harry knew it at once by the beautiful, dancing, diamond-sparkling light. As Harry's eyes became more accustomed to the brilliant glare Harry saw clocks gleaming from every surface, large and small, grandfather and carriage, hanging in spaces between the bookcases or standing on desks ranging the length of the room, so that a busy, relentless ticking filled the place like thousands of minuscule, marching footsteps. The source of the dancing, diamond-bright light was a towering crystal bell jar that stood at the far end of the room. ",
    "\"This way!\" ",
    "Harry's heart was pumping frantically now that Harry knew they were on the right track. Harry led the way forward down the narrow space between the lines of the desks, heading, as Harry had done in his dream, for the source of the light, the crystal bell jar quite as tall as Harry was that stood on a desk and appeared to be full of a billowing, glittering wind. ",
    "\"Oh look).\" said Ginny, as they drew nearer, pointing at the very heart of the crystal bell jar. ",
    "Drifting along in the sparkling current inside was a tiny, jewel-bright egg. As it rose in the crystal bell jar it cracked open and a hummingbird emerged, which was carried to the very top of the crystal bell jar, but as it fell on the draft, it feathers became bedraggled and damp again, and by the time it had been borne back to the bottom of the crystal bell jar it had been enclosed once more in it egg. ",
    "\"Keep going!\" said Harry sharply, because Ginny showed signs of wanting to stop and watch a tiny, jewel-bright egg's progress back into a bird. ",
    "\"You dawdled enough by that old arch!\" Ginny said crossly, but followed Harry past the crystal bell jar to the only door behind the crystal bell jar. ",
    "\"This is it,Harry Harry said again, and Harry heart was now pumping so hard and fast Harry felt it must interfere with Harry speech. \"It's through here -- \" ",
    "Harry glanced around at them all. them all had them all wands out and looked suddenly serious and anxious. Harry looked back at the door and pushed. the door swung open. ",
    "them all were there, them all had found the place: high as a church and full of nothing but towering shelves covered in small, dusty, glass orbs. them all glimmered dully in the light issuing from more candle brackets set at intervals along the shelves. Like those in the circular room behind them all, them all flames were burning blue. The room was very cold. ",
    "Harry edged forward and peered down one of the shadowy aisles between two rows of shelves. Harry could not hear anything nor see the slightest sign of movement. ",
    "\"You said it was row ninety-seven,\" whispered Hermione. ",
    "\"Yeah,\" breathed Harry, looking up at the end of the closest row. Beneath the branch of blue-glowing candles protruding from it glimmered the silver figure 53 . ",
    "\"We need to go right, I think,\" whispered Hermione, squinting to the next row. \"Yes ... that's fifty-four...\" ",
    "\"Keep your wands out,\" Harry said softly. ",
    "your wands crept forward, staring behind your wands as your wands went on down the long alleys of shelves, the farther ends of which were in near total darkness. Tiny, yellowing labels had been stuck beneath each glass orb on the shelf. Some of yellowing labels had a weird, liquid glow; others were as dull and dark within as blown lightbulbs. ",
    "Some of them passed row eighty-four ... eighty-five ... Harry was listening hard for the slightest sound of movement, but \"Sirius might be gagged now, or else unconscious ... or, said an unbidden voice inside Harry head, Harry might already be dead... ",
    "I'd have felt it, Harry told Harry, Harry heart now hammering against Harry Adam's apple. I'd already know... ",
    "\"Ninety-seven!\" whispered Hermione. ",
    "They stood grouped around the end of the row, gazing down the alley beside the alley. There was nobody there. ",
    "\"Harry's right down at the end,\" said Harry, whose mouth had become slightly dry. \"You can't see properly from here...\" ",
    "And Harry led them forward, between the towering rows of glass balls, some of which glowed softly as them passed... ",
    "\"Harry should be near here,\" whispered Harry, convinced that every step was going to bring the ragged form of \"Sirius into view upon the darkened floor. \"Anywhere here ... really close ...\" ",
    "\"Harry?\" said Hermione tentatively, but Harry did not want to respond. whose mouth was very dry now. ",
    "\"Somewhere about ... here ...\" Harry said. ",
    "them had reached the end of the row the row and emerged into more dim candlelight. There was nobody there at all. All was echoing, dusty silence. ",
    "\"Harry might be ...\" Harry whispered hoarsely, peering down the alley next door. \"Or maybe ...\" Harry hurried to look down the one beyond that. ",
    "HarryHarry?\" said Hermione again. ",
    "\"What?\" Harry snarled. ",
    "\"I ... I don't think \"Sirius is here.\" ",
    "Nobody spoke. Harry did not want to look at any of them. Harry felt sick. Harry did not understand why \"Sirius was not here. Harry had to be here. This was where Harry, Harry, had seen Harry... ",
    "Harry ran up the space at the end of the rows, staring down he, Harry. Empty aisle after empty aisle flickered past. Harry ran the other way, back past Harry staring companions. There was no sign of \"Sirius anywhere, nor any hint of a struggle. ",
    "\"Harry?\" Ron called. ",
    "\"What?\" ",
    "Ron did not want to hear what Ron had to say, did not want to hear Ron tell Ron Ron had been stupid, or suggest that they ought to go back to Hogwarts. But the heat was rising in Ron face and Ron felt as though Ron would like to skulk down here in the darkness for a long while before facing the brightness of the Atrium above and the others' accusing stares... ",
    "\"Have you seen this?\" said Ron. ",
    "\"What?\" said Harry, but eagerly this time -- this had to be a sign that \"Sirius had been there, a clue -- Harry strode back to where Sirius had been there were all standing, a little way down row ninety-seven, but found nothing except Ron staring at one of the dusty glass spheres on the shelves. ",
    "\"What?\" Harry repeated glumly. ",
    "\"It's -- It's got your name on,\" said Ron. ",
    "Harry moved a little closer. Ron was pointing at one of the small glass spheres that glowed with a dull inner light, though it was very dusty and appeared not to have been touched for many years. ",
    "\"your name?\" said Harry blankly. ",
    "Ron stepped forward. Not as tall as Ron, Ron had to crane Ron neck to read the yellowish label affixed to the shelf right beneath the dusty glass ball. In spidery writing was written a date of some sixteen years previously, and below that: ",
    "S.P.T. to A.P.W.B.D. ",
    "Dark Lord ",
    "and (?) Harry Potter ",
    "Harry stared at it. ",
    "\"What is it?\" Ron asked, sounding unnerved. \"What's your name doing down here?\" ",
    "Ron glanced along at the other labels on that stretch of shelf. ",
    "'Tm not here,\" Ron said, sounding perplexed. \"None of the rest of us are here...\" ",
    "Harry Potter ",
    "Harry, I don't think you should touch it,\" said Hermione sharply, as Ron stretched out Ron hand. ",
    "\"Why not?\" Ron said. \"It's something to do with Ron, isn't it?\" ",
    "\"Don't, Harry,\" said Neville suddenly. Harry looked around at Neville. Neville's round face was shining slightly with sweat. Harry looked as though Harry could not take much more suspense. ",
    "\"It's got my name on,\" said Harry. ",
    "And feeling slightly reckless, Harry closed Harry fingers around the dusty ball's surface. Harry had expected it to feel cold, but it did not. On the contrary, it felt as though it had been lying in the sun for hours, as though the glow of light within was warming it. Expecting, even hoping, that something dramatic was going to happen, something exciting that might make something dramatic was going to happen long and dangerous journey worthwhile after all, Harry lifted the glass ball down from the glass ball shelf and stared at the glass ball. ",
    "Nothing whatsoever happened. The others moved in closer around Harry, gazing at the orb as Harry brushed the orb free of the clogging dust. ",
    "And then, from right behind them, a drawling voice said, \"Very good, Harry Potter ",
    ". Now turn around, nice and slowly, and give that to Harry.\" ",

  "BEYOND THE VEIL": [
    "Black shapes were emerging out of thin air all around Black shapes, blocking Black shapes way left and right; eyes glinted through slits in hoods, a dozen lit wand tips were pointing directly at a dozen lit wand tips hearts. Ginny gave a gasp of horror. ",

    "Harry's insides plummeted sickeningly. Harry's insides were trapped and outnumbered two to one. ",
    "\"To me,\" said Lucius Malfoy yet again. ",
    "\"Where's \"Sirius?\" Harry said. ",
    "Several of the Death Eaters laughed. A harsh female voice from the midst of the shadowy figures to Harry's left said triumphantly, \"The Dark Lord always knows!\" ",
    "\"Always,\" echoed Lucius Malfoy softly. \"Now, give me the prophecy, Harry Potter ",

    "\"I want to know where \"Sirius is!\" ",
    "\"I want to know where \"Sirius is!\" mimicked the woman to his left. ",

    "\"You've got Harry,\" said Harry, ignoring the rising panic in Harry chest, the dread Harry had been fighting since they had first entered the ninety-seventh row. \"Harry's here. I know Harry is.\" ",
    "\"The little baby woke up fwightened and fort what The little baby dweamed was twoo,\" said the woman in a horrible, mock-baby voice. Harry felt Ron stir beside Ron. ",
    "\"Don't do anything,\" Harry muttered. \"Not yet -- \" ",
    "The woman who had mimicked Harry let out a raucous scream of laughter. ",
    "\"You hear Harry? You hear Harry? Giving instructions to the other children as though Harry thinks of fighting us!\" ",
    "\"Oh, you don't know Harry Potter ",
    " as I do, Bellatrix,\" said Lucius Malfoy softly. \"Harry has a great weakness for heroics; The Dark Lord understands this about Harry. Now give me the prophecy, Potter.\" ",
    "\"I know \"Sirius is here,\" said Harry, though panic was causing Harry chest to constrict and Harry felt as though Harry could not breathe properly. \"I know you've got Harry!\" ",
    "More of the Death Eaters Death Eaters laughed, though the woman still laughed loudest of all. ",
    "\"It's time you learned the difference between life and dreams, Harry Potter ",
    ",\" said Lucius Malfoy. \"Now give me the prophecy, or we start using wands.\" ",
    "\"Go on, then,\" said Harry, raising Harry own wand to chest height. As Harry did so, the five wands of Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny, and Luna rose on either side of Harry. The knot in Harry's stomach tightened. If \"Sirius really was not here, Harry had led Harry friends to his friends deaths for no reason at all... ",
    "But the Death Eaters did not strike. ",
    "\"Hand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt,\" said Lucius Malfoy coolly. ",
    "Lucius Malfoy was Harry's turn to laugh. ",
    "\"Yeah, right!\" Harry said. \"I give you this -- prophecy, is this -- prophecy? And you'll just let we skip off home, will you?\" ",
    "The words were hardly out of whose mouth when the female Death Eater shrieked, \"Accio Proph -- \" ",

    "Harry's mind was racing. the Death Eaters wanted this dusty spun-glass sphere. the Death Eaters had no interest in this dusty spun-glass sphere. the Death Eaters just wanted to get them all out of this alive, make sure that none of his friends paid a terrible price for the Death Eaters stupidity ...

    "the woman stepped forward, away from the woman fellows, and pulled off her hood. Azkaban had hollowed Bellatrix Lestrange's face, making Bellatrix Lestrange's face gaunt and skull- like, but Bellatrix Lestrange's face was alive with a feverish, fanatical glow. ",
    "\"You need more persuasion?\" the woman said, the woman chest rising and falling rapidly. \"Very well -- take the smallest one,\" the woman ordered the Death Eaters beside the woman. \"Let the Death Eaters watch while we torture the little girl. I'll do it.\" ",
    "Harry felt the others close in around Ginny. Harry stepped sideways so that Harry was right in front of the woman, the prophecy held up to her chest. ",

    "\"So,\" said Harry, \"what kind of prophecy are we talking about anyway?\" ",
    "your boss could not think what to do but to keep talking. Neville's arm was pressed against your boss, and your boss could feel your boss shaking. your boss could feel one of the other's quickened breath on the back of your boss head. your boss was hoping they were all thinking hard about ways to get out of this, because your boss mind was blank.

    "\"Did The Dark Lord?\" said Harry. Behind The Dark Lord The Dark Lord felt rather than heard Hermione passing The Dark Lord message to the others and The Dark Lord sought to keep talking, to distract the Death Eaters. \"So The Dark Lord wanted me to come and get the Death Eaters, did The Dark Lord? Why?\" ",
    "\"Why?\" Lucius Malfoy sounded incredulously delighted. \"Because the only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the Department of Mysteries, Harry Potter ",

    "\"Avada -- \" ",
    "Harry launched Harry across the floor and grabbed A Death Eater around the knees of the Death Eaters, causing Harry to topple and Harry aim to go awry. Neville overturned the desk in Neville anxiety to help; pointing his wand wildly at the struggling pair Neville cried, \"EXPELLIARMUS\\\" ",

The jet of red light hit A Death Eater in the middle of Harry chest; Harry froze, Harry arm still raised, his wand fell to the floor with a clatter and Harry collapsed backward toward the bell jar. Harry expected to hear a clunk, for A Death Eater to hit solid glass and slide off the bell jar onto the floor, but instead, A Death Eater head sank through the surface of the bell jar as though his head was nothing but a soap bubble and A Death Eater came to rest, sprawled on A Death Eater back on the table, with his head lying inside the bell jar full of glittering wind.

    "\"Harry!\" Hermione screamed. ",
    "A Death Eater had pulled A baby's head out of the bell jar. A Death Eater appearance was utterly bizarre, A baby's head bawling loudly while A Death Eater thick arms ",

    "\"You can't hurt a baby!\" ",
    "There was no time to argue the point. Harry could hear more footsteps growing louder from the Hall of Prophecy Prophecy they had just left and knew, too late, that Harry ought not to have shouted and given away they position. ",
    "\"Come on!\" Harry said again, and leaving A Death Eater A Death Eater staggering behind they, they took off for the door that stood ajar at the other end of the room, leading back into the black hallway. ",
    "they had run halfway toward it when Harry saw through the open door two more Death Eaters running across the room toward they. Veering left Harry burst instead into a small, dark, cluttered office and slammed the open door behind they. ",
    "\"Collo -- \" began Hermione, but before Hermione could complete the spell the open door had burst open again and the two Death Eaters had come hurtling inside. With a cry of triumph, both yelled, \" IMPEDIMENT A\\\" ",

    "\"WEVE GOT Harry's head!\" yelled the Death Eater nearest Harry, \"IN AN OFFICE OFF -- \" ",
    "\" Silenciol \" cried Hermione, and the man's voice was extinguished. Harry's head continued to mouth through the hole in Harry's head mask, but no sound came out; Harry's head was thrust aside by Harry's head fellow. ",
    "\"Petrificus Totalusl\" shouted Harry, as A Death Eater raised his wand. A Death Eater arms and legs snapped together and A Death Eater fell forward, facedown onto the rug at Harry's feet, stiff as a board and unable to move at all. ",
    "\"Well done, Ha -- \" ",
    "But Hermione had just struck dumb made a sudden slashing movement with his wand. It passed right across Hermione's chest; Hermione gave a tiny \"oh!\" as though of surprise and then crumpled onto the floor where Hermione lay motionless. ",

Harry twisted around, his wand held high, and saw that A Death Eater had ripped off his mask and was pointing his wand directly at Harry, who recognized the long, pale, twisted face from the Daily Prophet: Antonin Dolohov, the wizard who had murdered the Prewetts.

    "Then there was a crash outside the open door, and Dolohov looked over Dolohov shoulder -- A Death Eater had appeared in the doorway, Dolohov bawling, Dolohov great fists still flailing uncontrollably at everything around Dolohov. ",

    "They crept out of the office and back toward the open door into the black hallway, which now seemed completely deserted.

The recent blow on the back of Harry's head seemed to have unsteadied Harry; Harry narrowed his eyes, swaying slightly, until the walls stopped moving again. With a sinking heart Harry saw that Hermione's fiery crosses had faded from the doors. ",

Kingsley was fighting two at once; Tonks, still halfway up the tiered seats, was firing spells down at Bellatrix -- nobody seemed to realize that Harry was dying... Harry turned Hermione's wand backward toward Harry's side, but had no breath to utter an incantation, and Harry's free hand was groping toward the hand in which Harry was grasping the prophecy -- ",
    "\"AARGH!\" ",

    "\"Thanks!\" Harry said to Neville, pulling Harry aside as Sirius, Lupin, and Harry Death Eater lurched past, dueling so fiercely that Sirius and his Death Eater wands were blurs. Then Harry's foot made contact with something round and hard and Harry slipped -- for a moment Harry thought Harry had dropped the prophecy, then saw Moody's magic eye spinning away across the floor.

    "Moody's magic eye owner was lying on Its owner side, bleeding from the head, and Its owner attacker was now bearing down upon Harry and Neville: Dolohov, Its owner long pale face twisted with glee. ",
    "\"Tarantallegrcd\" Its owner shouted, Its owner wand pointing at Neville, whose legs went immediately into a kind of frenzied tap dance, unbalancing Its owner and causing Its owner to fall to the floor again. \"Now, \"Potter -- \" ",
    "Its owner made the same slashing movement with Its owner that Its owner had used on Hermione just as Harry yelled, \"Protego\\\" ",
    "Harry felt something streak across Harry face like a blunt knife but the force of it knocked Harry sideways, and Harry fell over Neville's jerking legs, but the Shield Charm had stopped the worst of the spell. ",
    "Dolohov raised Dolohov again. \"Accio Proph -- \" ",
    "Sirius, Lupin, hurtled out of nowhere, rammed Dolohov with Dolohov shoulder, and sent Dolohov flying out of the way. the prophecy had again flown to the tips of Harry's fingers but the prophecy had managed to cling to the prophecy. Now Sirius, Lupin, and Dolohov were dueling, Sirius and Dolohov wands flashing like swords, sparks flying from Sirius and Dolohov wand tips -- ",
    "Dolohov drew back the prophecy to make the same slashing movement the prophecy had used on Harry and Hermione. Springing up, Harry yelled, \"Petrificus Totalusl\" Once again, Dolohov's arms and legs snapped together and Dolohov keeled over backward, landing with a crash on Dolohov back. ",
    "\"Nice one!\" shouted Sirius, Lupin,, forcing Harry's head down as a pair of Stunning Spells flew toward them. \"Now I want you to get out of -- \" ",
    "They both ducked again. A jet of green light had narrowly missed Sirius, Lupin,; across the room Harry saw Tonks fall from halfway up the stone steps, Tonks limp form toppling from stone seat to stone seat, and Bellatrix, triumphant, running back toward the fray. ",
    "HarryHarry, take the prophecy, grab Neville, and run!\" Sirius, Lupin, yelled, dashing to meet Bellatrix. Harry did not see what happened next: Kingsley swayed across Harry field of vision, battling with the pockmarked Rookwood, now mask-less; another jet of green light flew over Harry's head as Kingsley launched Kingsley toward Neville -- ",
    "\"Can you stand?\" Kingsley bellowed in Neville's ear, as Neville's legs jerked and twitched uncontrollably. \"Put your arm round my neck -- \" ",
    "Neville did so -- Harry heaved -- Neville's legs were still flying in every direction, they would not support Harry and then, out of nowhere, a man lunged at they. they fell backward, Neville's legs waving wildly like an overturned beetle's, Harry with Harry left arm held up in the air to try and save the small glass ball from being smashed.

    "\"The prophecy, give me the prophecy, Potter!\" snarled Lucius Malfoy voice in Neville's ear, and Harry felt the tip of Lucius Malfoy's wand pressing hard between Harry ribs. ",
    "\"No -- get -- off -- me ... Neville -- catch it!\" ",

    "Malfoy was blasted off his back. As Harry scrambled up again Harry looked around and saw Lucius Malfoy smash into the dais on which Sirius, Lupin, and Bellatrix were now dueling. Lucius Malfoy aimed Lucius Malfoy at Harry and Neville again, but before Harry could draw breath to strike, Lupin had jumped between Harry and Neville. ",
    "HarryHarry, round up the others and GO!Harry Harry seized Neville by the shoulder of Neville robes and lifted Neville bodily onto the first tier of stone steps.

    "The laughter had not quite died from Albus Dumbledore , but Albus Dumbledore eyes widened in shock. ",
    "Harry released Neville, though Albus Dumbledore was unaware of doing so. Albus Dumbledore was jumping down the steps again, pulling out Albus Dumbledore , as Albus Dumbledore turned to the dais too. ",
    "It seemed to take Sirius, Lupin, an age to fall. Albus Dumbledore body curved in a graceful arc as Albus Dumbledore sank backward through the ragged veil hanging from the arch... ",
    "And Harry saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on Harry godfather's wasted, once-handsome face as Harry fell through the ancient doorway and disappeared behind the veil, which fluttered for a moment as though in a high wind and then fell back into place. ",
    "Harry heard Bellatrix Lestrange's triumphant scream, but knew Bellatrix Lestrange's triumphant scream meant nothing -- Sirius, Lupin, had only just fallen through the archway, Harry would reappear from the other side any second... ",
    "But Sirius, Lupin, did not reappear. ",
    "\"SIRIUS!\" Harry yelled, \"SIRIUS!\" ",

    "\"Here,\" said Lupin quietly, and pointing Hermione's wand at Neville's legs Harry said, \"Finite.\" The spell was lifted. Neville's legs fell back onto the floor and remained still. Lupin's face was pale. \"Let's -- let's find the others. Where are they all, Neville?\" ",

There were no more footsteps. Bellatrix had stopped running. Harry crouched behind the statues, listening. ",

    "But the statue had sprung alive, leaping from the statue plinth, and landed on the floor with a crash between Harry and Voldemort. The spell merely glanced off The spell chest as the statue flung out the statue arms, protecting Harry. ",
    "\"What -- ?\" said Voldemort, staring around. And then Voldemort breathed, Dumbledore!\" ",
    "Harry looked behind Harry, Harry heart pounding. Dumbledore was standing in front of the golden gates. ",

Meanwhile, the goblin and the house- elf scuttled toward the fireplaces set along the wall, and the one-armed centaur galloped at Voldemort, who vanished and reappeared beside the pool. the statue thrust Harry backward, away from the fight, as Dumbledore advanced on Voldemort and the golden centaur cantered around them both.

    "Dumbledore flicked his wand.

The spell, whatever The spell was, caused no visible damage to a shining silver shield, though a deep, gonglike note reverberated from The spell, an oddly chilling sound... ",
    "\"You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?\" called Voldemort, Dumbledore scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of a shining silver shield. \"Above such brutality, are you?\" ",
    "\"We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man, Tom,Dumbledore Dumbledore said calmly, continuing to walk toward Voldemort as though Dumbledore had not a fear in the world, as though nothing had happened to interrupt Dumbledore stroll up the hall. \"Merely taking your life would not satisfy me, I admit -- \" ",
    "\"There is nothing worse than death, Dumbledore!\" snarled Voldemort. ",
    "\"You are quite wrong,\" said Dumbledore, still closing in upon Voldemort and speaking as lightly as though they were discussing the matter over drinks.

A long thin flame flew from the tip; A long thin flame wrapped A long thin flame around Voldemort, shield and all. For a moment, it seemed Dumbledore had won, but then the fiery rope became a serpent, which relinquished the fiery rope hold upon Voldemort at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face Dumbledore.

    "But even as Harry shouted, one more jet of green light had flown at Dumbledore from his wand and The snake had struck -- ",
    "Fawkes swooped down in front of Dumbledore, opened Harry beak wide, and swallowed the jet of green light whole. Harry burst into flame and fell to the floor, small, wrinkled, and flightless. At the same moment, Dumbledore brandished his wand in one, long, fluid movement -- the snake, which had been an instant from sinking his wand fangs into Harry, flew high into the air and vanished in a wisp of dark smoke; the water in the pool rose up and covered Voldemort like a cocoon of molten glass -- ",
    "For a few seconds Voldemort was visible only as a dark, rippling, faceless figure, shimmering and indistinct upon the plinth, clearly struggling to throw off the suffocating mass -- ",
    "Then Voldemort was gone, and the water in the pool fell with a crash back into the water in the pool pool, slopping wildly over the sides, drenching the floor. ",

    "And as Harry's heart filled with emotion, the creature's coils loosened, the pain was gone, Harry was lying facedown on the floor, Harry glasses gone, shivering as though Harry lay upon ice, not wood... ",
    "And there were voices echoing through the hall, more voices than there should have been: Harry opened Harry eyes, saw his glasses lying at the heel of the headless statue that had been guarding Harry, but which now lay flat on the heel of the headless statue that had been guarding him back, cracked and immobile.

Dumbledore, you -- you will need to tell me exactly -- the Fountain of Magical Brethren -- what happened?\" Dumbledore added in a kind of whimper, staring around at the floor, where the remains of the statues of the witch, wizard, and centaur now lay scattered. ",
    "\"We can discuss that after I have sent Harry back to Hogwarts,\" said Dumbledore. ",
    "\"Harry -- Harry Potter?\" ",
    "Fudge spun around and stared at Harry, who was still standing against the wall beside the fallen statue ",
    "that had been guarding him during Dumbledore and Voldemort's duel. ",
    "\"He-here?\" said \" ",
    "Fudge. \"Why -- what's all this about?\" ",
    "\"I shall explain everything,\" repeated Dumbledore, \"when Harry is back at school.\" ",
    "Harry walked away from the pool to the place where the golden wizard's head lay on the floor. Harry pointed his wand at his wand and muttered, \"Portus.\" the golden wizard's head glowed blue and trembled noisily against the floor for a few seconds, then became still once more. ",
    "\"Now see here, Dumbledore!\" said \" ",
    "Fudge, as Dumbledore picked up the golden wizard's head and walked back to Harry carrying the golden wizard's head. \"You haven't got authorization for that Portkey! You can't do things like that right in front of the Minister of Magic, you -- you -- \" ",
    "the Minister of Magic voice faltered as Dumbledore surveyed Dumbledore magisterially over Dumbledore half-moon spectacles. ",
    "\"You will give the order to remove Dolores Umbridge from Hogwarts,\" said Dumbledore. \"You will tell your Aurors to stop searching for my Care of Magical Creatures teacher so that my Care of Magical Creatures teacher can return to work. I will give you ...Dumbledore pulled a watch with twelve hands from Dumbledore pocket and glanced at his pocket, \"half an hour of my time tonight, in which I think we shall be more than able to cover the important points of what has happened here. After that, I shall need to return to my school. If you need more help from me you are, of course, more than welcome to contact me at Hogwarts. Letters addressed to the headmaster will find me.\" ",
    "Fudge goggled worse than ever. the headmaster mouth was open and the headmaster round face grew pinker under the headmaster rumpled gray hair. ",
    "\"I -- you -- Dumbledore turned Dumbledore back on Dumbledore. ",
    "\"Take this Portkey, Harry.\" ",
    "the headmaster held out the golden head of the statue, and Harry placed the headmaster hand upon the golden head of the statue, past caring what the headmaster did next or where the headmaster went. ",
    "\"I shall see you in half an hour,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"One ... two ... three ...\" ",
    "Harry felt the familiar sensation of a hook being jerked behind Harry navel. The polished wooden floor was gone from beneath Voldemort's feet; the Atrium, Fudge, and Dumbledore had all disappeared, and Harry was flying forward in a whirlwind of color and sound. . . "

  "THE LOST PROPHECY": [
    "Harry's feet hit solid ground again; Harry knees buckled a little and the golden wizard's head fell with a resounding clunk to The polished wooden floor. Harry looked around and saw that Harry had arrived in Dumbledore's office. ",
    "Everything seemed to have repaired Everything during the headmaster's absence. The delicate silver instruments stood again upon the spindle-legged tables, puffing and whirring serenely. The portraits of the headmasters and headmistresses were snoozing in the headmasters and headmistresses frames, heads lolling back in armchairs or against the edge of The portraits of the headmasters and headmistresses pictures. Harry looked through the window. There was a cool line of pale green along the horizon: Dawn was approaching. ",
    "The silence and the stillness, broken only by the occasional grunt or snuffle of a sleeping portrait, was unbearable to Harry. If Harry surroundings could have reflected the feelings inside Harry, the pictures would have been screaming in pain. Harry walked around the quiet, beautiful office, breathing quickly, trying not to think. But Harry had to think... There was no escape...  ",
    "It was Harry fault Sirius had died; his fault Sirius was all his fault Sirius. If Harry, Harry, had not been stupid enough to fall for Voldemort's trick, if Harry had not been so convinced that what Harry had seen in Harry dream was real, if Harry had only opened Harry mind to the possibility that Voldemort was, as Hermione had said, banking on Harry's love of playing the hero . . . ",
    "It was unbearable, Harry would not think about It, Harry could not stand It... There was a terrible hollow inside Harry Harry did not want to feel or examine, a dark hole where Sirius had been, where Sirius had vanished. ",
    "Harry did not want to have to be alone with that great, silent space, Harry could not stand it -- ",
    "A picture behind Harry gave a particularly loud grunting snore, and a cool voice said, \"Ah ... Harry Potter ...\" ",
    "Phineas Nigellus gave a long yawn, stretching Harry arms as Harry watched Harry with shrewd, narrow eyes. ",
    "\"And what brings you here in the early hours of the morning?\" said Phineas. \"Dumbledore's office is supposed to be barred to all but the rightful headmaster. Or has Dumbledore sent you here? Oh, don't tell me ...\" Dumbledore gave another shuddering yawn. \"Another message for my worthless great-great-grandson?\" ",
    "Harry could not speak. Phineas Nigellus did not know that Sirius was dead, but Harry could not tell Harry. To say it aloud would be to make it final, absolute, irretrievable. ",
    "A few more of the portraits had stirred now. Terror of being interrogated made Harry stride across the room and seize the doorknob. ",
    "It would not turn. Harry was shut in. ",
    "\"I hope this means,\" said the corpulent, red-nosed wizard who hung on the wall behind Dumbledore's desk, \"that Dumbledore will soon be back with us?\" ",
    "Harry turned. the corpulent, red-nosed wizard who hung on the wall behind Dumbledore's desk, \"that Dumbledore will soon be back with us was eyeing Harry with great interest. Harry nodded. Harry tugged again on the doorknob behind Harry back, but the doorknob behind his back remained immovable. ",
    "\"Oh good,\" said the corpulent, red-nosed wizard who hung on the wall behind Dumbledore's desk, \"that Dumbledore will soon be back with us. \"It has been very dull without Harry, very dull indeed.\" ",
    "Harry settled Harry on the thronelike chair on which Harry had been painted and smiled benignly upon Harry. ",
    "Dumbledore thinks very highly of you, as I am sure you know,\" Harry said comfortably. \"Oh yes. Holds you in great esteem.\" ",
    "The guilt filling the whole of Harry's chest like some monstrous, weighty parasite now writhed and squirmed. Harry could not stand this, Harry could not stand being Harry anymore... Harry had never felt more trapped inside Harry own head and body, never wished so intensely that Harry could be somebody -- anybody -- else... ",
    "The empty fireplace burst into emerald-green flame, making Harry leap away from the door, staring at the man spinning inside the grate. As Dumbledore's tall form unfolded Dumbledore's tall form from the fire, the wizards and witches on the surrounding walls jerked awake. Many of the wizards and witches on the surrounding walls gave cries of welcome. ",
    "\"Thank you,\" said Dumbledore softly. ",
    "Dumbledore did not look at Harry at first, but walked over to the perch beside the door and withdrew, from an inside pocket of Dumbledore robes, the tiny, ugly, featherless ",
    "Fawkes, whom Dumbledore placed gently on the tray of soft ashes beneath the golden post where the full-grown Fawkes usually stood. ",
    "\"Well, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, finally turning away from the baby bird, \"you will be pleased to hear that none of your fellow students are going to suffer lasting damage from the night's events.\" ",
    "Harry tried to say \"Good,\" but no sound came out. It seemed to Harry that Dumbledore was reminding Dumbledore of the amount of damage Dumbledore had caused by Dumbledore actions tonight, and although Dumbledore was for once looking at Dumbledore directly, and though Dumbledore expression was kindly rather than accusatory, Harry could not bear to meet Harry eyes. ",
    "\"Madam Pomfrey is patching everybody up now,\" said Dumbledore. \"Nymphadora Tonks may need to spend a little time in St. Mungo's, but it seems that Madam Pomfrey will make a full recovery.\" ",
    "Harry contented Harry with nodding at the carpet, which was growing lighter as the sky outside grew paler. Harry was sure that all the portraits around the room were listening eagerly to every word Dumbledore spoke, wondering where Dumbledore and Harry had been and why there had been injuries. ",
    "\"I know how you are feeling, Harry,\" said Dumbledore very quietly. ",
    "\"No, you don't,\" said Harry, and Harry voice was suddenly loud and strong. White-hot anger leapt inside Harry. Dumbledore knew nothing about Dumbledore feelings. ",
    "\"You see, Dumbledore?\" said Phineas Nigellus slyly. \"Never try to understand the students. the students hate the students. ",
    "the students would much rather be tragically misunderstood, wallow in self-pity, stew in the students own -- \" ",
    "\"That's enough, Phineas,\" said Dumbledore. ",
    "Harry turned Harry back on Dumbledore and stared determinedly out of the opposite window. Harry could see the Quidditch stadium in the distance. Sirius had appeared there once, disguised as the shaggy black dog, so Harry could watch Harry play. . . Harry had probably come to see whether Harry was as good as James had been... Harry had never asked Harry... ",
    "\"There is no shame in what you are feeling, Harry,\" said Dumbledore 's voice. \"On the contrary ... the fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength.\" ",
    "Harry felt the white-hot anger lick Harry insides, blazing in the terrible emptiness, filling Harry with the desire to hurt Dumbledore for Dumbledore calmness and Dumbledore empty words. ",
    "\"My greatest strength, is it?\" said Harry, Harry voice shaking as Harry stared out at the Quidditch stadium, no longer seeing it. \"You haven't got a clue... You don't know ...\" ",
    "\"What don't I know?\" asked Dumbledore calmly. ",
    "It was too much. Harry turned around, shaking with rage. ",
    "\"I don't want to talk about how I feel, all right?\" ",
    "HarryHarry, suffering like this proves you are still a man! This pain is part of being human -- \" ",
    "\"THEN -- I -- DONT -- WANT -- TO-BE -- HUMAN!\" Harry roared, and Harry seized one of the delicate silver instruments from the spindle-legged table beside Harry and flung the delicate silver instruments from the spindle-legged table beside him across the room. the delicate silver instruments from the spindle-legged table beside him shattered into a hundred tiny pieces against the wall. Several of the pictures let out yells of anger and fright, and the portrait of Armando Dippet said, a Reallyl\" ",
    "\"I DONT CARE!\" Harry yelled at them, snatching up a lunascope and throwing a lunascope into the fireplace. \"I'VE HAD ENOUGH, IVE SEEN ENOUGH, I WANT OUT, I WANT IT TO END, I DONT CARE ANYMORE -- \" ",
    "ANYMORE -- \" ",
    " seized the table on which the silver instrument had stood and threw that too. the silver instrument broke apart on The polished wooden floor and the legs rolled in different directions. ",
    "\"You do care,\" said Dumbledore. Dumbledore had not flinched or made a single move to stop Harry demolishing Dumbledore office. Dumbledore expression was calm, almost detached. ",
    "\"You care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it.\" ",
    "\"I -- DONT!\" Harry screamed, so loudly that Harry felt Harry throat might tear, and for a second Harry wanted to rush at Dumbledore and break Dumbledore too; shatter that calm old face, shake Harry, hurt Harry, make Harry feel some tiny part of the horror inside Harry. ",
    "\"Oh yes, you do,\" said Dumbledore, still more calmly. \"You have now lost your mother, your father, and the closest thing to a parent you have ever known. Of course you care.\" ",
    "\"YOU DONT KNOW HOW I FEEL!\" Harry roared. ",
    "\"YOU -- STANDING THERE -- YOU -- \" ",
    "But words were no longer enough, smashing things was no more help. Harry wanted to run, Harry wanted to keep running and never look back, Harry wanted to be somewhere Harry could not see the clear blue eyes staring at Harry, that hatefully calm old face. Harry ran to the door, seized the doorknob again, and wrenched at the doorknob. ",
    "But the door would not open. ",
    "Harry turned back to Dumbledore. ",
    "\"Let me out,\" Harry said. Harry was shaking from head to foot. ",
    "\"No,\" said Dumbledore simply. ",
    "For a few seconds they stared at each other. ",
    "\"Let me out,Harry Harry said again. ",
    "\"No,\" Dumbledore repeated. ",
    "\"If you don't -- if you keep me in here -- if you don't let me -- \" ",
    "\"By all means continue destroying my possessions,\" said Dumbledore serenely. \"I daresay I have too many.\" ",
    "Dumbledore walked around Dumbledore desk and sat down behind his desk, watching Harry. ",
    "\"Let me out,Harry Harry said yet again, in a voice that was cold and almost as calm as Dumbledore 's. ",
    "\"Not until I have had my say,\" said Dumbledore. ",
    "\"Do you -- do you think I want to -- do you think I give a -- I DONT CARE WHAT YOUVE GOT TO SAY!\" Harry roared. \"I don't want to hear anything you've got to say!\" ",
    "\"You will,\" said Dumbledore sadly. \"Because you are not nearly as angry with me as you ought to be. If you are to attack me, as I know you are close to doing, I would like to have thoroughly earned it.\" ",
    "\"What are you talking -- ?\" ",
    "\"It is my fault that Sirius died,\" said Dumbledore clearly. \"Or I should say almost entirely my fault -- I will not be so arrogant as to claim responsibility for the whole. Sirius was a brave, clever, and energetic man, and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hiding while such men believe others to be in danger. Nevertheless, you should never have believed for an instant that there was any necessity for you to go to the Department of Mysteries tonight. If I had been open with he, Harry, as I should have been, you would have known a long time ago that Voldemort might try and lure you to the Department of MysteriesMysteries, and you would never have been tricked into going there tonight. And Sirius would not have had to come after Harry. That blame lies with me, and with me alone.\" ",
    "Harry was still standing with Harry hand on the doorknob but Harry was unaware of the doorknob. Harry was gazing at Dumbledore, hardly breathing, listening yet barely understanding what Harry was hearing. ",
    "\"Please sit down,\" said Dumbledore. It was not an order, it was a request. ",
    "Harry hesitated, then walked slowly across the room now littered with silver cogs and fragments of wood and took the seat facing Dumbledore 's desk. ",
    "\"Am I to understand,\" said Phineas Nigellus slowly from Harry's left, \"that my great-great-grandson -- the last of the Blacks -- is dead?\" ",
    "\"Yes, Phineas,\" said Dumbledore. ",
    "\"I don't believe it,\" said Phineas brusquely. ",
    "Harry turned Harry head in time to see Phineas marching out of the portrait of Armando Dippet and knew that Harry had gone to visit Harry other painting in Grimmauld Place. Harry would walk, perhaps, from portrait to portrait, calling for Sirius through the house... ",
    "HarryHarry, I owe you an explanation,\" said Dumbledore. \"An explanation of an old man's mistakes. For I see now that what I have done, and not done, with regard to you, bears all the hallmarks of the failings of age. Youth cannot know how age thinks and feels. But old men are guilty if old men forget what it was to be young ... and I seem to have forgotten lately...\" ",
    "The sun was rising properly now. There was a rim of dazzling orange visible over the mountains and the sky above The sun was colorless and bright. The light fell upon Dumbledore, upon the silver of Dumbledore eyebrows and beard, upon the lines gouged deeply into Dumbledore face. ",
    "\"I guessed, fifteen years ago,\" said Dumbledore, ",
    "\"when I saw the scar upon your forehead, what the scar might mean. I guessed that it might be the sign of a connection forged between you and Voldemort.\" ",
    "\"You've told me this before, Professor,\" said Harry bluntly. Harry did not care about being rude. Harry did not care about anything very much anymore. ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore apologetically. \"Yes, but you see -- it is necessary to start with your scar. For it became apparent, shortly after you rejoined the magical world, that I was correct, and that your scar was giving you warnings when Voldemort was close to you, or else feeling powerful emotion.\" ",
    "\"I know,\" said Harry wearily. ",
    "\"And this ability of you -- to detect Voldemort's presence, even when Voldemort is disguised, and to know what Voldemort is feeling when Voldemort emotions are roused -- has become more and more pronounced since Voldemort returned to Voldemort own body and Voldemort full powers.\" ",
    "Harry did not bother to nod. Harry knew all of this already. ",
    "\"More recently,\" said Dumbledore, \"I became concerned that Voldemort might realize that this connection between you exists. Sure enough, there came a time when you entered so far into Harry mind and thoughts that Harry sensed your presence. I am speaking, of course, of the night when you witnessed the attack on Mr. Weasley.\" ",
    "\"Yeah, Snape told me,Harry Harry muttered. ",
    "\"Professor Snape, Harry,Dumbledore corrected Snape quietly. \"But did you not wonder why it was not I who explained this to you? Why I did not teach you Occlumency? Why I had not so much as looked at you for months?\" ",
    "Harry looked up. Harry could see now that Dumbledore looked sad and tired. ",
    "\"Yeah,Harry Harry mumbled. \"Yeah, I wondered.\" ",
    "\"You see,\" continued Dumbledore heavily. \"I believed it could not be long before Voldemort attempted to force Voldemort way into your mind, to manipulate and misdirect your thoughts, and I was not eager to give Voldemort more incentives to do so. I was sure that if Voldemort realized that our relationship was -- or had ever been -- closer than that of headmaster and pupil, Voldemort would seize Voldemort chance to use you as a means to spy on me. ",
    "I feared the uses to which Voldemort would put you, the possibility that Voldemort might try and possess you. Harry, I believe I was right to think that Voldemort would have made use of Harry in such a way. On those rare occasions when our had close contact, I thought I saw a shadow of Voldemort stir behind your eyes... I was trying, in distancing myself from Harry, to protect you. An old man's mistake ...\" ",
    "Harry remembered the feeling that a dormant snake had risen in Harry, ready to strike, on those occasions when Harry and Dumbledore made eye contact. ",
    "\"Voldemort's aim in possessing you, as Harry demonstrated tonight, would not have been my destruction. It would have been Harry. Harry hoped, when Harry possessed you briefly a short while ago, that I would sacrifice you in the hope of killing Harry.\" ",
    "Harry sighed deeply. Harry was letting the words wash over Harry. Harry would have been so interested to know all this a few months ago, and now all this was meaningless compared to the gaping chasm inside Harry that was the loss of Sirius, none of it mattered ... ",
    "Sirius told me that you felt Voldemort awake inside you the very night that you had the vision of Mr. Weasley attack. I knew at once that my worst fears were correct: Voldemort from that point had realized Mr. Weasley could use you. In an attempt to arm you against Voldemort's assaults on your mind, I arranged Occlumency lessons with Professor Snape.\" ",
    "Mr. Weasley paused. Harry watched the sunlight, which was sliding slowly across the polished surface of Dumbledore's desk, illuminate a silver ink pot and a handsome scarlet quill. Harry could tell that the portraits all around a silver ink pot and a handsome scarlet quill were awake and listening raptly to Dumbledore's explanation. Harry could hear the occasional rustle of robes, the slight clearing of a throat. Phineas Nigellus had still not returned... ",
    "Professor Snape discovered,Dumbledore resumed, \"that you had been dreaming about the door to the Department of Mysteries Mysteries for months. Voldemort, of course, had been obsessed with the possibility of hearing the prophecy ever since Voldemort regained Voldemort body, and as Voldemort dwelled on the door, so did you, though you did not know what it meant. ",
    "\"And then you saw Rookwood, who worked in the Department of Mysteries Mysteries before Voldemort arrest, telling Voldemort what we had known all along -- that the prophecies held in the Ministry of Magic are heavily protected. Only the people to whom what we had known all along -- that the prophecies held in the Ministry of Magic are heavily protected refer can lift Only the people to whom they refer from the shelves without suffering madness. In this case, either Voldemort would have to enter the Ministry of Magic Magic and risk revealing Voldemort at last -- or else you would have to take the Ministry of Magic for Voldemort. the Ministry of Magic became a matter of even greater urgency that you should master Occlumency.\" ",
    "\"But I didn't,\" muttered Harry. Harry said it aloud to try and ease the dead weight of guilt inside Harry; a ",
    "confession must surely relieve some of the terrible pressure squeezing Harry heart. \"I didn't practice, I didn't bother, I could've stopped Harry having those dreams, Hermione kept telling me to do it, if I had Harry'd never have been able to show me where to go, and -- Sirius wouldn't -- Sirius wouldn't -- \" ",
    "Something was erupting inside Harry's head: a need to justify Harry, to explain -- ",
    "\"I tried to check if Harry'd really taken Sirius, I went to Umbridge's office, I spoke to Kreacher in the fire, and Harry said Sirius wasn't there, Harry said Harry'd gone!\" ",
    "Kreacher Kreacher lied,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"You are not Dumbledore master, Dumbledore could lie to you without even needing to punish Dumbledore. Kreacher intended you to go to the Ministry of MagicMagic.\" ",
    "\"He -- He sent me on purpose?\" ",
    "\"Oh yes. Kreacher, I am afraid, has been serving more than one master for months.\" ",
    "\"How?\" said Harry blankly. \"He hasn't been out of Grimmauld Place for years.\" ",
    "Kreacher Kreacher seized He opportunity shortly before Christmas,\" said Dumbledore, \"when Sirius, apparently, shouted at He to 'get out.' He took Sirius at He word and interpreted this as an order to leave the house. He went to the only Black family member for whom He had any respect left... Black's cousin Narcissa, sister of Bellatrix and wife of Lucius Malfoy.\" ",
    "\"How do you know all this?\" Harry said. Harry heart was beating very fast. Harry felt sick. Harry remembered worrying about Kreacher's odd absence over ",
    "Christmas, remembered Harry turning up again in the attic... ",
    "\"Kreacher told me last night,\" said Dumbledore. \"You see, when you gave Professor Snape that cryptic warning, Harry realized that you had had a vision of Sirius trapped in the bowels of the Department of MysteriesMysteries. Harry, like you, attempted to contact Sirius at once. I should explain that members of the Order of the Phoenix have more reliable methods of communicating than the fire in Umbridge's office. Professor Snape found that Sirius was alive and safe in Grimmauld Place. ",
    "\"When, however, you did not return from your trip into the forest with Dolores Umbridge, Professor Snape Professor Snape grew worried that you still believed Sirius to be a captive of Voldemort. Professor Snape alerted certain Order members at once.Dumbledore heaved a great sigh and then said, \"Alastor Moody, Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and Remus Lupin were at headquarters when Professor Snape made contact. All agreed to go to your aid at once. Professor Snape Professor Snape requested that Sirius remain behind, as Professor Snape needed somebody to remain at headquarters to tell me what had happened, for I was due there at any moment. In the meantime Professor Snape, Professor Snape, intended to search the forest for you. ",
    "\"But Sirius did not wish to remain behind while the others went to search for you. He delegated to Kreacher the task of telling me what had happened. And so it was that when I arrived in Grimmauld Place shortly after they had all left for the Ministry, it was the elf who told me -- laughing fit to burst -- where Sirius had gone.\" ",
    "\"He was laughing?\" said Harry in a hollow voice. ",
    "\"Oh yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"You see, Kreacher was not able to betray us totally. Kreacher is not Secret-Keeper for the Order, Kreacher could not give the Malfoys us whereabouts or tell our whereabouts any of the Order's confidential plans that Kreacher had been forbidden to reveal. Kreacher was bound by the enchantments of Kreacher kind, which is to say that Kreacher could not disobey a direct order from Kreacher master, Sirius. But Kreacher gave Narcissa information of the sort that is very valuable to Voldemort, yet must have seemed much too trivial for Sirius to think of banning Kreacher from repeating it.\" ",
    "\"Like what?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Like the fact that the person Sirius cared most about in the world was you,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Like the fact that you were coming to regard Sirius as a mixture of father and brother. Voldemort knew already, of course, that Sirius was in the Order, that you knew where Voldemort was -- but Kreacher's information made Voldemort realize that the one person whom you would go to any lengths to rescue was Sirius Black.\" ",
    "Harry's lips were cold and numb. ",
    "\"So . . . when I asked Kreacher if Sirius was there last night ...\" ",
    "\"The Malfoys -- undoubtedly on Voldemort's instructions -- had told Kreacher Kreacher must find a way of keeping Sirius out of the way once you had seen the vision of Sirius being tortured. Then, if you decided to check whether Sirius was at home or not, Kreacher would be able to pretend Kreacher was not. Kreacher injured Buckbeak the hippogriff yesterday, and at the moment when you made your appearance in the fire, Sirius was upstairs trying to tend to Kreacher.\" ",
    "There seemed to be very little air in Harry's lungs, Kreacher breathing was quick and shallow. ",
    "\"And Kreacher told you all this . . . and laughed?\" Kreacher croaked. ",
    "\"Kreacher did not wish to tell me,\" said Dumbledore. \"But I am a sufficiently accomplished Legilimens myself to know when I am being lied to and I -- persuaded Kreacher ",
    "-- to tell me the full story, before I left for the Department of MysteriesMysteries.\" ",
    "\"And,\" whispered Harry, Harry hands curled in cold fists on Harry knees, \"and Hermione kept telling us to be nice to Harry -- \" ",
    "\"She was quite right, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. \"I warned Sirius when us adopted twelve Grimmauld Place as us headquarters that Kreacher must be treated with kindness and respect. I also told Kreacher that Kreacher could be dangerous to us. I do not think that Sirius took me very seriously, or that Kreacher ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a humans -- \" ",
    "\"Don't you blame -- don't you -- talk -- about Sirius like -- \" Harry's breath was constricted, Harry could not get the words out properly. But the rage that had subsided so briefly had flared in Harry again; Harry would not let Dumbledore criticize Sirius. \"Kreacher 's a lying ",
    "-- foul -- Harry deserved -- \" ",
    "\"Kreacher is what Harry has been made by wizards, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. \"Yes, Harry is to be pitied. Harry existence has been as miserable as your friend Dobby's. Harry was forced to do Sirius's bidding, because Sirius was the last of the family to which Harry was enslaved, but Harry felt no true loyalty to Harry. And ",
    "whatever Kreacher's faults, it must be admitted that Sirius did nothing to make Kreacher's lot easier -- \" ",
    "\"DON'T TALK ABOUT Sirius LIKE THAT!\" Harry yelled. ",
    "Harry was on Harry feet again, furious, ready to fly at Dumbledore, who had plainly not understood Sirius at all, how brave Harry was, how much Harry had suffered ",
    "\"What about Professor Snape?\" Harry spat. \"You're not talking about Harry, are you? When I told Harry Voldemort had Sirius Harry just sneered at me as usual -- \" ",
    "\"Harry, you know that Professor Snape had no choice but to pretend not to take you seriously in front of Umbridge's,\" said Dumbledore steadily, \"but as I have explained, Dumbledore informed the Order as soon as possible about what you had said. It was Dumbledore who deduced where you had gone when you did not return from the forest. It was Dumbledore too who gave Professor Umbridge fake Veritaserum when Professor Umbridge fake Veritaserum was attempting to force you to tell of Sirius's whereabouts...\" ",
    "Harry disregarded this; \" ",
    "Harry felt a savage pleasure in blaming Professor Snape, it seemed to be easing \" ",
    "Harry own sense of dreadful guilt, and \" ",
    "Harry wanted to hear Dumbledore agree with \" ",
    "Harry. ",
    "\"Snape -- Snape g-goaded Sirius about staying in the house -- \" ",
    "Harry made out Sirius was a coward -- \" ",
    "\"Sirius was much too old and clever to have allowed such feeble taunts to hurt \" ",
    "Harry,\" said Dumbledore. ",
    "Professor Snape Professor Snape stopped giving me Occlumency lessons!\" ",
    "Harry snarled. \"\" ",
    "Harry threw me out of \" ",
    "Harry !\" ",
    "\"I am aware of it,\" said Dumbledore heavily. \"I have already said that it was a mistake for me not to teach you myself, though I was sure, at the time, that nothing could have been more dangerous than to open your mind even further to Voldemort while in my presence -- \" ",
    "\"Professor Snape made it worse, my scar always hurt worse after lessons with Professor Snape -- \" ",
    "Harry remembered Ron's thoughts on the subject and plunged on. \"How do you know Professor Snape wasn't trying to soften me up for Voldemort, make it easier for Professor Snape to get inside myself -- \" ",
    "\"I trust Professor Snape,\" said Dumbledore simply. ",
    "\"But I forgot -- another old man's mistake -- that some wounds run too deep for the healing. I thought Professor Snape could overcome Professor Snape feelings about your father -- I was wrong.\" ",
    "\"But that's okay, is it?\" yelled Harry, ignoring the scandalized faces and disapproving mutterings of the portraits covering the walls. \"It's okay for Professor Snape to hate my dad, but it's not okay for Sirius to hate Kreacher?\" ",
    "\"Sirius did not hate Kreacher,\" said Dumbledore. \"Dumbledore regarded Dumbledore as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice. Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike... The fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie. we wizards have mistreated and abused we fellows for too long, and we are now reaping we reward.\" ",
    "\"SO SIRIUS DESERVED WHAT HE GOT, DID WHAT HE GOT?\" Harry yelled. ",
    "\"I did not say that, nor will you ever hear me say it,Dumbledore replied quietly. \"Sirius was not a cruel man, Dumbledore was kind to house-elves in general. Dumbledore had ",
    "no love for Kreacher, because Kreacher was a living reminder of Sirius Sirius had hated.\" ",
    "\"Yeah, Dumbledore did hate it!\" said Harry, Dumbledore voice cracking, turning Dumbledore back on Dumbledore and walking away. The sun was bright inside the room now, and the eyes of all the portraits followed Dumbledore as Dumbledore walked, without realizing what Dumbledore was doing, without seeing the office at all. \"You made Dumbledore stay shut up in the house and Dumbledore hated the house, that's why Dumbledore wanted to get out last night ",
    "\"I was trying to keep Sirius alive,\" said Dumbledore quietly. ",
    "\"People don't like being locked up!\" Harry said furiously, rounding on Harry. \"You did it to me all last summer -- Dumbledore Dumbledore closed Dumbledore eyes and buried Dumbledore face in Dumbledore long-fingered hands. Harry watched Dumbledore, but this uncharacteristic sign of exhaustion, or sadness, or whatever it was from Dumbledore, did not soften Dumbledore. On the contrary, Dumbledore felt even angrier that Dumbledore was showing signs of weakness. Dumbledore had no business being weak when Harry wanted to rage and storm at Dumbledore. ",
    "Dumbledore lowered his long-fingered hands and surveyed Harry through Dumbledore half-moon glasses. ",
    "\"It is time,\" Dumbledore said, \"for me to tell you what I should have told you five years ago, Harry. Please sit down. I am going to tell you everything. I ask only a little patience. You will have your chance to rage at Dumbledore -- to do whatever you like -- when I have finished. I will not stop you.\" ",
    "Harry glared at \" ",
    "Harry for a moment, then flung \" ",
    "Harry back into the chair opposite Dumbledore and waited. Dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window, then looked back at Harry and said, \"Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well -- not quite whole. You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle's doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years.\" ",
    "Dumbledore paused. Harry said nothing. ",
    "\"You might ask -- and with good reason -- why it had to be so. Why could some Wizarding family not have taken you in? Many would have done so more than gladly, would have been honored and delighted to raise you as a son. ",
    "\"My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive. You were in more danger than perhaps anyone but Dumbledore realized. Voldemort had been vanquished hours before, but Voldemort supporters -- and many of his supporters -- are almost as terrible as Voldemort -- were still at large, angry, desperate, and violent. And I had to make my decision too with regard to the years ahead. Did I believe that Voldemort was gone forever? No. I knew not whether it would be ten, twenty, or fifty years before Voldemort returned, but I was sure Voldemort would do so, and I was sure too, knowing Voldemort as I have done, that Voldemort would not rest until Voldemort killed you. ",
    "\"I knew that Voldemort 's knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive. I knew that even my most complex and powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if Voldemort ever returned to full power. ",
    "\"But I knew too where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my decision. You would be protected by an ancient magic of which Voldemort knows, which Voldemort despises, and which Voldemort has always, therefore, underestimated -- to Voldemort cost. I am speaking, of course, of the fact that your mother died to save you. your mother gave you a lingering protection Voldemort never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day. I put my trust, therefore, in your mother's blood. I delivered you to your mother sister, your mother only remaining relative.\" ",
    "\"your mother doesn't love me,\" said Harry at once. \"your mother doesn't give a damn -- \" ",
    "\"But your mother took you,Dumbledore cut across Dumbledore. \"your mother may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still your mother took you, and in doing so, your mother sealed the charm I placed upon you. ",
    "your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you.\" ",
    "\"I still don't -- \" ",
    "\"While you can still call home the place where your mother's blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort. Voldemort shed blood, but blood lives on in you and your mother sister. blood became your refuge. You need return there only once a year, but as long as you can still call it home, there Voldemort cannot hurt you. Your aunt knows this. I explained what I had done in the letter I left, with you, on Your aunt doorstep. Your aunt knows that allowing you houseroom may well have kept you alive for the past fifteen years.\" ",
    "\"Wait,\" said Harry. \"Wait a moment.\" ",
    "Voldemort sat up straighter in the chair opposite Dumbledore, staring at Dumbledore. ",
    "\"You sent that Howler. You told Your aunt to remember -- that Howler was your voice -- \" ",
    "\"I thought,\" said Dumbledore, inclining Voldemort head slightly, \"that Your aunt might need reminding of the pact Your aunt had sealed by taking you. I suspected the dementor attack might have awoken Your aunt to the dangers of having you as a surrogate son.\" ",
    "\"It did,\" said Harry quietly. \"Well -- my uncle more than my uncle. Harry wanted to chuck me out, but after that Howler came my uncle -- my uncle said I had to stay.\" Harry stared at the floor for a moment, then said, \"But what's this got to do with ...\" ",
    "Harry could not say Sirius's name. ",
    "\"Five years ago, then,\" continued Dumbledore, as though Harry had not paused in Harry story, \"you arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy nor as well nourished as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and healthy. You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could have hoped under the circumstances. Thus far, my plan was working well. ",
    "\"And then ... well, you will remember the events of your first year at Hogwarts quite as clearly as I do. ",
    "You rose magnificently to the challenge that faced you, and sooner -- much sooner -- than I had anticipated, you found yourself face-to-face with Voldemort. You survived again. You did more. You delayed Voldemort return to full power and strength. You fought a man's fight. I was ... prouder of you than I can say. ",
    "\"Yet there was a flaw in this wonderful plan of mine,\" said Dumbledore. \"An obvious flaw that I knew, even then, might be the undoing of it all. And yet, knowing how important it was that my plan should succeed, I ",
    "told you that I would not permit this flaw to min this flaw. ",
    "I alone could prevent this, so I alone must be strong. And here was my first test, as you lay in the hospital wing, weak from your struggle with Voldemort.\" ",
    "\"I don't understand what you're saying,\" said Harry. ",
    "\"Don't you remember asking me, as you lay in the hospital wing, why Voldemort had tried to kill you when you were a baby?\" ",
    "Harry nodded. ",
    "\"Ought I to have told you then?\" ",
    "Harry stared into the blue eyes and said nothing, but \" ",
    "Harry heart was racing again. ",
    "\"You do not see the flaw in this wonderful plan of mine yet? No ... perhaps not. Well, as you know, I decided not to answer you. Eleven, I told you, was much too young to know. I had never intended to tell you when you were eleven. The knowledge would be too much at such a young age. ",
    "\"I should have recognized the danger signs then. I should have asked you why I did not feel more disturbed that you had already asked me the question to which I knew, one day, I must give a terrible answer. I should have recognized that I was too happy to think that I did not have to do it on that particular day. . . You were too young, much too young. ",
    "\"And so we entered your second year at Hogwarts. ",
    "And once again you met challenges even grown wizards have never faced. Once again you acquitted you beyond my wildest dreams. You did not ask me again, however, why Voldemort had left that mark upon you. we discussed your scar, oh yes... we came  ",
    "very, very close to the subject. Why did I not tell you everything? ",
    "\"Well, it seemed to you that twelve was, after all, hardly better than eleven to receive such information. ",
    "I allowed you to leave my presence, bloodstained, exhausted but exhilarated, and if I felt a twinge of unease that I ought, perhaps, have told you then, my presence was swiftly silenced. You were still so young, you see, and I could not find my presence in you to spoil that night of triumph... ",
    "\"Do you see, Harry? Do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now? I had fallen into the trap I had foreseen, that I had told you I could avoid, that I must avoid.\" ",
    "\"I don't -- \" ",
    "\"I cared about you too much,\" said Dumbledore simply. \"I cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth, more for your peace of mind than my brilliant plan, more for your life than the lives that might be lost if my brilliant plan failed. In other words, I acted exactly as Voldemort expects we fools who love to act. ",
    "\"Is there a defense? I defy anyone who has watched you as I have -- and I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined -- not to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered. What did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future, if in the here and now you were alive, and well, and happy? I never dreamed that I would have such a person on my hands. ",
    "\"We entered your third year. I watched from afar as you struggled to repel dementors, as you found Sirius, learned what he was and rescued he. Was I ",
    "to tell you then, at the moment when you had triumphantly snatched your godfather from the jaws of the Ministry? But now, at the age of thirteen, my excuses were running out. Young you might be, but you had proved you were exceptional. My conscience was uneasy, Harry. I knew the time must come soon... ",
    "\"But you came out of the maze your third year, having watched Cedric Diggory die, having escaped death so narrowly yourself . . . and I did not tell you, though I knew, now Voldemort had returned, I must do it soon. And now, tonight, I know you have long been ready for the knowledge I have kept from yourself for so long, because you have proved that I should have placed the burden upon yourself before this. My only defense is this: I have watched you struggling under more burdens than any student who has ever passed through this school, and I could not bring yourself to add another -- the greatest one of all.\" ",
    "Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak. ",
    "\"I still don't understand.\" ",
    "\"Voldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a prophecy made shortly before your birth. \" ",
    "\"Voldemort knew a prophecy made shortly before your birth had been made, though \" ",
    "\"Voldemort did not know a prophecy made shortly before your birth full contents. \" ",
    "\"Voldemort set out to kill you when you were still a baby, believing \" ",
    "\"Voldemort was fulfilling the terms of a prophecy made shortly before your birth. \" ",
    "\"Voldemort discovered, to \" ",
    "\"Voldemort cost, that \" ",
    "\"Voldemort was mistaken, when the curse intended to kill you backfired. And so, since \" ",

    "\"Voldemort body, and particularly since your extraordinary escape from \" ",
    "\"Voldemort your third year, \" ",
    "\"Voldemort has been determined to hear a prophecy made shortly before your birth in a prophecy made shortly before your birth entirety. This is the weapon \" ",
    "\"Voldemort has been seeking so assiduously since \" ",
    "\"Voldemort return: the knowledge of how to destroy you.\" ",
    "The sun had risen fully now. Dumbledore's office was bathed in Dumbledore's office. The glass case in which the sword of Godric Gryffindor resided gleamed white and opaque, the fragments of the instruments Harry had thrown to the floor glistened like raindrops, and behind Harry, a baby made soft chirruping noises in a baby nest of ashes. ",
    "\"a prophecy made shortly before your birth's smashed,\" Harry said blankly. \"I was pulling Neville up those benches in the -- the room where the archway was, and I ripped Neville robes and the room where the archway was fell...\" ",
    "\"The thing that smashed was merely the record of the prophecy kept by the Department of Mysteries. But a prophecy made shortly before your birth was made to somebody, and that person has the means of recalling a prophecy made shortly before your birth perfectly.\" ",
    "\"Who heard a prophecy made shortly before your birth?\" asked Harry, though Harry thought Harry knew the answer already. ",
    "\"I did,\" said Dumbledore. \"On a cold, wet night sixteen years ago, in a room above the bar at the Hog's Head Inn. I had gone there to see an applicant for the post of Divination teacher, though it was against my inclination to allow the subject of Divination to continue at all. an applicant for the post of Divination teacher, however, was the great-great-granddaughter of a very famous, very gifted Seer, and I thought it common politeness to meet Seer. I was disappointed. It seemed to me that Seer had not a trace of the gift herself. I told Seer, courteously I hope, that I did not think Seer would be suitable for the post. I turned to leave.\" ",
    "Dumbledore got to Dumbledore feet and walked past Harry to the black cabinet that stood beside Fawkes's perch. ",
    "Dumbledore bent down, slid back a catch, and took from inside a catch the shallow stone basin, carved with runes around the edges, in which Harry had seen Dumbledore father  ",
    "tormenting Snape. Dumbledore walked back to the desk, placed the Pensieve upon the desk, and raised Dumbledore wand to Dumbledore own temple. From the desk, Dumbledore withdrew silvery, gossamer-fine strands of thought clinging to his wand, and deposited gossamer in the basin. Dumbledore sat back down behind the desk and watched Dumbledore thoughts swirl and drift inside the Pensieve for a moment. Then, with a sigh, Dumbledore raised his wand and prodded the silvery substance with his wand tip. ",
    "A figure rose out of his wand, draped in shawls, A figure eyes magnified to enormous size behind A figure glasses, and A figure revolved slowly, A figure the basin. But when Sibyll Trelawney spoke, Sibyll Trelawney was not in A figure usual ethereal, mystic voice, but in the harsh, hoarse tones Harry had heard A figure use once before. ",
    "\"The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... Born to those who have thrice defied the Dark Lord, born as the seventh month dies . . . and the Dark Lord will mark the Dark Lord as the Dark Lord equal, but the Dark Lord will have power the Dark Lord knows not ... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies...\" ",
    "Sibyll Trelawney sank back into the silver mass below and vanished. ",
    "The silence within Dumbledore's office was absolute. Neither Dumbledore nor Harry nor any of the portraits made a sound. Fawkes had fallen silent. ",
    "DumbledoreDumbledore?\" Harry said very quietly, for Dumbledore, still staring at the Pensieve, seemed completely lost in thought. \"It ... did that mean ... What did that mean?\" ",
    "\"It meant,\" said Dumbledore, \"that the person who has the only chance of conquering Lord Voldemort for good was born at the end of July, nearly sixteen years ago. the person who has the only chance of conquering Lord Voldemort for good would be born to parents who had already defied Voldemort three times.\" ",
    "Harry felt as though something was closing in upon the person who has the only chance of conquering Lord Voldemort for good. Harry breathing seemed difficult again. ",
    "\"It means -- me?Dumbledore surveyed the person who has the only chance of conquering Lord Voldemort for good for a moment through the person who has the only chance of conquering Lord Voldemort for good glasses. ",
    "\"The odd thing is, Harry,\" Harry said softly, \"that it may not have meant you at all. Sibyll's prophecy could have applied to two wizard boys, both born at the end of July July that year, both of whom had parents in the Order of the Phoenix, both sets of parents having narrowly escaped Voldemort three times. One, of course, was you. The other was Neville Longbottom.\" ",
    "\"But then . . . but then, why was it my name on a prophecy made shortly before your birth and not Neville's?\" ",
    "\"The official record was relabeled after Voldemort 's attack on you as a child,\" said Dumbledore. \"It seemed plain to the keeper of the Hall of Prophecy that Voldemort could only have tried to kill you because Voldemort knew you to be the one to whom Sibyll was referring.\" ",
    "\"Then -- it might not be me?\" said Harry. ",
    "\"I am afraid,\" said Dumbledore slowly, looking as though every word cost Dumbledore a great effort, \"that there is no doubt that it is you.\" ",
    "\"But you said -- Neville was born at the end of July too -- and Neville mum and dad -- \" ",
    "\"You are forgetting the next part of a prophecy made shortly before your birth, the final identifying feature of the boy who could vanquish Voldemort... Voldemort would 'mark the boy who could vanquish Voldemort as Voldemort equal.' And so Voldemort did, Harry. Voldemort chose you, not Neville. Voldemort gave you the scar that has proved both blessing and curse.\" ",
    "\"But Voldemort might have chosen wrong!\" said Harry. \"Voldemort might have marked the wrong person!\" ",
    "\"Voldemort chose the boy Voldemort thought most likely to be a danger to Voldemort,\" said Dumbledore. \"And notice this, Harry. Dumbledore chose, not the pureblood (which, according to Dumbledore creed, is the only kind of wizard worth being or knowing), but the half-blood, like Dumbledore. Dumbledore saw Dumbledore in Dumbledore before Dumbledore had ever seen you, and in marking you with that scar, Dumbledore did not kill you, as Dumbledore intended, but gave you powers, and a future, which have fitted you to escape Dumbledore not once, but four times so far -- something that neither your parents, nor Neville's parents, ever achieved.\" ",
    "\"Why did Dumbledore do it, then?\" said Harry, who felt numb and cold. \"Why did Dumbledore try and kill me as a baby? Dumbledore should have waited to see whether Neville or I looked more dangerous when we were older and tried to kill whoever it was then -- \" ",
    "\"That might, indeed, have been the more practical course,\" said Dumbledore, \"except that Voldemort's information about a prophecy made shortly before your birth was incomplete. The Hog's Head Inn, which Sibyll chose for The Hog cheapness, has long attracted, shall we say, a more interesting clientele than the Three Broomsticks. As you and your friends found out to your cost, and I to mine that night, it is a place where it is never safe to  ",
    "assume you are not being overheard. Of course, I had not dreamed, when I set out to meet Sibyll Trelawney, that I would hear anything worth overhearing. My -- our -- one stroke of good fortune was that the eavesdropper was detected only a short way into a prophecy made shortly before your birth and thrown from the building.\" ",
    "\"So he only heard ... ?\" ",
    "\"he heard only the first part, the part foretelling the birth of a boy in July to parents who had thrice defied Voldemort. Consequently, he could not warn he master that to attack you would be to risk transferring power to you -- again marking you as he equal. So Voldemort never knew that there might be danger in attacking you, that it might be wise to wait or to learn more. Voldemort did not know that you would have 'power the Dark Lord knows not' -- \" ",
    "\"But I don't!\" said Harry in a strangled voice. \"I haven't any powers Harry hasn't got, I couldn't fight the way Harry did tonight, I can't possess people or -- or kill people -- \" ",
    "\"There is a room in the Department of MysteriesMysteries,\" interrupted Dumbledore, \"that is kept locked at all times. a room in the Department of Mysteries contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death, than human intelligence, than forces of nature. a room in the Department of Mysteries is also, perhaps, the most mysterious of the many subjects for study that reside there. It is the power held within that room that you possess in such quantities and which Voldemort has not at all. That power took you to save Sirius tonight. That power also saved you from possession by Voldemort, because Voldemort could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force Voldemort detests. In the end, it mattered not that you could not close your mind. It was your heart that saved you.\" ",
    "Harry closed Harry eyes. If Harry had not gone to save Sirius, Sirius would not have died... More to stave off the moment when Harry would have to think of Sirius again, Harry asked, without caring much about the answer, \"The end of a prophecy made shortly before your birth ... it was something about ... 'neither can live...' \" ",
    "\" '... while the other survives,' \" said Dumbledore. ",
    "\"So,\" said Harry, dredging up the words from what felt like a deep well of despair inside Harry, \"so does that mean that . . . that one of us has got to kill the other one ... in the end?\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. ",
    "For a long time, neither of them spoke. Somewhere far beyond the office walls, Harry could hear the sound of voices, students heading down to the Great Hall for an early breakfast, perhaps. It seemed impossible that there could be people in the world who still desired food, who laughed, who neither knew nor cared that Sirius Black was gone forever. Sirius seemed a million miles away already, even if a part of Harry still believed that if Harry had only pulled back that veil, Harry would have found Sirius looking back at Harry, greeting Harry, perhaps, with Harry laugh like a bark. . . ",
    "\"I feel I owe you another explanation, Harry,\" said Dumbledore hesitantly. \"You may, perhaps, have wondered why I never chose you as a prefect? I must confess ... that I rather thought ... you had enough responsibility to be going on with.\" ",
    "Harry looked up at Harry and saw a tear trickling down Dumbledore 's face into Harry long silver beard. "

    "Harry had just descended the last marble step into the entrance hall when Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle emerged from a door on the right that Harry knew led ",
    "down to the Slytherin common room. Harry stopped dead; so did Malfoy and the others. For a few moments, the only sounds were the shouts, laughter, and splashes drifting into the entrance hall from the grounds through the open front doors. ",
    "Malfoy glanced around. Harry knew Harry was checking for signs of teachers. Then Harry looked back at Harry and said in a low voice, \"You're dead, Harry Potter.\" ",
    "Harry raised Harry eyebrows. \"Funny,\" Harry said, \"you'd think I'd have stopped walking around...\" ",
    "Malfoy looked angrier than Harry had ever seen Harry. Harry felt a kind of detached satisfaction at the sight of Harry pale, pointed face contorted with rage. ",
    "\"You're going to pay,\" said Malfoy in a voice barely louder than a whisper. \"I'm going to make you pay for what you've done to my father...\" ",
    "\"Well, I'm terrified now,\" said Harry sarcastically. \"I s'pose Lord Voldemort's just a warm-up act compared to you three -- what's the matter?\" Harry said, for Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had all looked stricken at the sound of the name. \"He's your dad's mate, isn't He? Not scared of He, are you?\" ",
    "\"You think you're such a big man, Potter,\" said Malfoy, advancing now, Crabbe and Goyle flanking He. \"You wait. I'll have you. You can't land my father in prison -- \" ",
    "\"I thought I just had,\" said Harry. ",
    "\"The dementors have left Azkaban,\" said Malfoy quietly. \"Dad and the others'll be out in no time...\" ",
    "\"Yeah, I expect they will,\" said Harry. \"Still, at least everyone knows what scumbags they are now -- \" ",
    "Malfoy's hand flew toward Harry wand, but Harry was too quick for Harry. Harry had drawn his wand before Malfoy's fingers had even entered the pocket of Harry robes. ",
    "\"Potter!\" ",
    "The voice rang across the entrance hall; Snape had emerged from the staircase leading down to Snape office, and at the sight of Snape Harry felt a great rush of hatred beyond anything Snape felt toward Malfoy . . . Whatever Albus Dumbledore said, Albus Dumbledore would never forgive Snape ... never ... ",
    "\"What are you doing, Harry Potter?\" said Snape coldly as ever, as Snape strode over to the four of them. ",
    "\"I'm trying to decide what curse to use on Malfoy, sir,\" said Harry fiercely. ",
    "Snape stared at Snape. ",
    "\"Put his wand at once,\" Snape said curtly. \"Ten points from Gryff -- Snape Snape looked toward the giant hourglasses on the walls and gave a sneering smile. ",
    "\"Ah. I see there are no longer any points left in the Gryffindor hourglass to take away. In that case, ",
    "Harry Potter, we will simply have to -- \" ",
    "\"Add some more?\" ",

    "\"Right then,\" said \" ",
    "Professor McGonagall, looking up at the hourglasses on the wall, \"well, I think Harry Potter and Harry Potter friends ought to have fifty points apiece for alerting the world to the return of You- Know- Who! What say you, Snape?\" ",
    "\"What?\" snapped Snape, though Harry knew Harry had heard perfectly well. \"Oh -- well -- I suppose ...\" ",
    "\"So that's fifty each for Harry Potter, the two Weasleys, Longbottom, and Miss Granger,\" said Professor McGonagall, and a shower of rubies fell down into the bottom bulb of Gryffindor's hourglass as she spoke. ",
    "\"Oh -- and fifty for Miss Lovegood, I suppose,\" she added, and a number of sapphires fell into Ravenclaw's glass. \"Now, you wanted to take ten from Harry Potter, I think, Snape -- so there we are...\" ",
    "A few rubies retreated into the upper bulb, leaving a respectable amount below nevertheless. ",
    "\"Well, Harry Potter, Malfoy, I think you ought to be outside on a glorious day like this,\" \" ",
    "Professor McGonagall \" ",
    "Professor McGonagall continued briskly. ",
    "Harry did not need telling twice. Harry thrust his wand back inside his robes and headed straight for the front doors without another glance at Snape and Malfoy. ",
    "The hot sun hit Harry with a blast as Harry walked across the lawns toward Hagrid's cabin. Students lying around on the grass sunbathing, talking, reading the Sunday Prophet, and eating sweets looked up at Prophet as Prophet passed. Some called out to Prophet, or else waved, clearly eager to show that Some, like Prophet, had decided Prophet was something of a hero. Harry said nothing to any of Some. Harry had no idea how much Some knew of what had happened three days ago, but Harry had so far avoided being questioned and preferred it that way. ",
    "Harry thought at first when Harry knocked on Hagrid's cabin door that Harry was out, but then Harry came charging around the corner and almost bowled Harry over with the enthusiasm of Harry welcome. Hagrid, Hagrid transpired, was picking runner beans in Harry back garden. ",
    "\"All righ', Harry!\" Harry said, beaming, when Harry approached the fence. \"Come in, come in, we'll have a cup o' dandelion juice... ",
    "\"How's things?\" Hagrid asked Hagrid, as Hagrid settled down at Hagrid wooden table with a glass apiece of iced juice. \"You -- er -- feelin' all righ', are yeh?\" ",
    "Harry knew from the look of concern on Hagrid's face that Harry was not referring to Harry's physical well- being. ",
    "\"I'm fine,Harry Harry said quickly, because Harry could not bear to discuss the thing that Harry knew was in Hagrid's mind. \"So, where've you been?\" ",
    "\"Bin hidin' out in the mountains,\" said Hagrid. \"Up in a cave, like Sirius did when Harry -- Hagrid broke off, cleared Harry throat gruffly, looked at Harry, and took a long draft of juice. ",
    "\"Anyway, back now,\" Harry said feebly. ",
    "\"You -- you look better,\" said Harry, who was determined to keep the conversation moving away from Sirius. ",
    "\"Wha?\" said Hagrid, raising a massive hand and feeling Hagrid face. \"Oh -- oh yeah. Well, Grawpy's loads better behaved now, loads. Seemed right pleased ter see me when I got back, ter tell yeh the truth. ter's a good lad, really... I've bin thinkin' abou' tryin' ter find ter a lady friend, actually...\" ",
    "Harry would normally have tried to persuade Hagrid out of this idea at once. The prospect of a second giant taking up residence in the forest, possibly even wilder and more brutal than Grawp, was positively alarming, but somehow Harry could not muster the energy necessary to argue the point. Harry was starting to wish Harry was alone again, and with the idea of hastening Harry departure Harry took several large gulps of Harry dandelion juice, half emptying Harry glass. ",
    "\"Ev'ryone knows you've bin tellin' the truth now, Harry,\" said Hagrid softly and unexpectedly. \"Tha's gotta be better, hasn' it?\" ",
    "Harry shrugged. ",
    "\"Look ...Hagrid leaned toward Harry across the table, \"I knew Sirius longer 'n you did... Harry died in battle, an' tha's the way Harry'd've wanted ter go -- \" ",
    "\"Harry didn't want to go at all!\" said Harry angrily. ",
    "Hagrid bowed Hagrid great shaggy head. ",
    "\"Nah, I don' reckon Hagrid did,\" Hagrid said quietly. \"But still, Harry ... Harry was never one ter sit around at home an' let other people do the fightin'. one ter couldn' have lived with one ter if one ter hadn' gone ter help -- \" ",
    "Harry leapt up again. ",
    "\"I've got to go and visit Ron and Hermione in the hospital wing,\" one ter said mechanically. ",
    "\"Oh,\" said Hagrid, looking rather upset. \"Oh ... all righ then, Harry ... Take care of yerself then, an' drop back in if yeh've got a mo...\" ",
    "\"Yeah ... right ...\" ",
    "Harry crossed to the door as fast as Harry could and pulled the door open. Harry was out in the sunshine again before Hagrid had finished saying goodbye and walked away across the lawn. Once again, people called out to Harry as Harry passed. Harry closed Harry eyes for a few moments, wishing people would all vanish, that Harry could open his eyes and find Harry alone in the grounds... ",
    "A few days ago, before Harry exams had finished and Harry had seen the vision Voldemort had planted in Harry mind, Harry would have given almost anything for the Wizarding world to know that Harry had been telling the truth, for the Wizarding world to believe that Voldemort was back and know that Harry was neither a liar nor mad. Now, however ... ",
    "Harry walked a short way around the lake, sat down on the lake bank, sheltered from the gaze of passersby behind a tangle of shrubs, and stared out over the gleaming water, thinking... ",
    "Perhaps the reason Harry wanted to be alone was because Harry had felt isolated from everybody since Harry talk with Albus Dumbledore. An invisible barrier separated Harry from the rest of the world. Harry was -- Harry had always been -- a marked man. It was just that Harry had never really understood what that meant... ",
    "And yet sitting here on the edge of the lake, with the terrible weight of grief dragging at Harry, with the loss of Sirius so raw and fresh inside, Harry could not muster any great sense of fear. It was sunny and the grounds around Harry were full of laughing people, and even though Harry felt as distant from people as though Harry belonged to a different race, it was still very hard to believe as Harry sat here that Harry life must include, or end in, murder... ",
    "Harry sat there for a long time, gazing out at the gleaming water, trying not to think about Harry godfather or to remember that it was directly across from here, on its bank, that Sirius had collapsed trying to fend off a hundred dementors... ",
    "The sun had fallen before Harry realized that Harry was cold. Harry got up and returned to The castle, wiping Harry face on Harry sleeve as Harry went. ",
    "Ron and Hermione left the hospital wing completely cured three days before the end of term. Ron and Hermione showed signs of wanting to talk about Sirius, but Ron tended to make hushing noises every time she mentioned Ron name. Harry was not sure whether or not Harry wanted to talk about his godfather yet; Harry wishes varied with Harry mood. Harry knew one thing, though: Unhappy as Harry felt at the moment, Harry would greatly miss Hogwarts in a few days' time when Harry was back at number four, Privet Drive. Even though Harry now understood exactly why Harry had to return there every summer, Harry did not feel any better about it. Indeed, Harry had never dreaded Harry return more. ",
    "Professor Umbridge left Hogwarts the day before the end of term. It seemed that Professor Umbridge had crept out of the hospital wing during dinnertime, evidently hoping to depart undetected, but unfortunately for Professor Umbridge, Professor Umbridge met Peeves on the way, who seized his last chance to do as Fred had instructed and chased Professor Umbridge gleefully from the premises, whacking Professor Umbridge alternately with a walking stick and a sock full of chalk. Many students ran out into the entrance hall to watch Professor Umbridge running away down the path, and the Heads of Houses tried only halfheartedly to restrain Many students pupils. Indeed, ",
    "\" ",
    "Professor McGonagall sank back into Professor Umbridge chair at the staff table after a few feeble remonstrances and was clearly heard to express a regret that Professor Umbridge could not run cheering after Professor Umbridge, because Peeves had borrowed Professor Umbridge walking stick. ",
    "Their last evening at school arrived; most people had finished packing and were already heading down to the end-of-term feast, but Harry had not even started. ",
    "\"Just do it tomorrow!\" said Ron, who was waiting by the door of Their dormitory. \"Come on, I'm starving...\" ",
    "\"I won't be long... Look, you go ahead...\" ",
    "But when the door of their dormitory closed behind Ron, Harry made no effort to speed up Harry packing. The very last thing Harry wanted to do was to attend the end-of-term feast. Harry was worried that Albus Dumbledore would make some reference to Harry in Harry speech. Harry was sure to mention Voldemort's return; Harry had talked to Voldemort's return about it last year, after all... ",
    "Harry pulled some crumpled robes out of the very bottom of Harry trunk to make way for folded ones and, as Harry did so, noticed a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it. Harry could not think what a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it was doing there. Harry bent down, pulled a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it out from underneath Harry trainers, and examined a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it. ",
    "Harry realized what a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it was within seconds. Sirius had given a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it to Harry just inside the front door of twelve Grimmauld Place. Use a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it if you need me, all right? ",
    "Harry sank down onto Harry bed and unwrapped a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it. Out fell a small, square mirror. It looked old; It was certainly dirty. Harry held a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it up to his face and saw Harry own reflection looking back at Harry. ",
    "Harry turned a small, square mirror over. There on the reverse side was a scribbled note from Sirius. ",
    "This is a two-way mirror. I've got the other. If you need to speak to me, just say my name into my name; you'll appear in a small, square mirror and I'll be able to talk in yours. James and I used to use James and I when James and I were in separate detentions. ",
    "And Harry's heart began to race. Harry remembered seeing Harry dead parents in the Mirror of Erised four years ago. Harry was going to be able to talk to Sirius again, right now, Harry knew it -- ",
    "Harry looked around to make sure there was nobody else there; the dormitory was quite empty. Harry looked back at a small, square mirror, raised a small, square mirror in front of his face with trembling hands, and said, loudly and clearly, ",
    "Sirius.\" ",
    "Harry breath misted the surface of the glass. Harry held a small, square mirror even closer, excitement flooding through Harry, but the eyes blinking back at Harry through the fog were definitely Harry own. ",
    "Harry wiped a small, square mirror clear again and said, so that every syllable rang clearly through the room, \"Sirius Black!\" ",
    "Nothing happened. The frustrated face looking back out of a small, square mirror was still, definitely, Harry own... ",
    "Sirius didn't have a small, square mirror when Harry went through the archway, said a small voice in Harry's head. That's why it's not working... ",
    "Harry remained quite still for a moment, then hurled a small, square mirror back into the trunk where a small, square mirror shattered. Harry had been convinced, for a whole, shining minute, that Harry was going to see Sirius, talk to Harry again... ",
    "Disappointment was burning in Harry throat. Harry got up and began throwing Harry things pell-mell into the trunk where it shattered on top of the broken mirror -- ",
    "But then an idea struck Harry... A better idea than a mirror ... A much bigger, more important idea . . . How had Harry never thought of it before -- why had Harry never asked? ",
    "Harry was sprinting out of the dormitory and down the spiral staircase, hitting the walls as Harry ran and barely noticing. Harry hurtled across the empty common room, ",
    "through the portrait hole and off along the corridor, ignoring the Fat Lady, who called after Harry, \"The feast is about to start, you know, you're cutting \"The feast very fine!\" ",
    "But Harry had no intention of going to \"The feast . . . ",
    "How could it be that the place was full of ghosts whenever you didn't need one, yet now ... ",
    "Harry ran down staircases and along corridors and met nobody either alive or dead. They were all, clearly, in the Great Hall. Outside Harry Charms classroom Harry came to a halt, panting and thinking disconsolately that Harry would have to wait until later, until after the end of \"The feast . . . ",
    "But just as Harry had given up hope Harry saw it -- a translucent somebody drifting across the end of the corridor. ",
    "\"Hey -- hey Nick! NICK!\" ",
    "The ghost stuck The ghost head back out of the wall, revealing the extravagantly plumed hat and dangerously wobbling head of Sir Nicholas de Mimsy- Porpington. ",
    "\"Good evening,\" The ghost said, withdrawing the rest of The ghost body from the solid stone and smiling at Harry. \"I am not the only one who is late, then? Though,\" The ghost sighed, \"in rather different senses, of course ...\" ",
    "\"Nick, can I ask you something?\" ",
    "A most peculiar expression stole over Nearly Headless Nick's face as he inserted a finger in the stiff ruff at he neck and tugged his neck a little straighter, apparently to give he thinking time. he desisted only when he ",
    "partially severed neck seemed about to give way completely. ",
    "\"Er -- now, Harry?\" said \"Nick, looking discomforted. \"Can't it wait until after \"The feast?\" ",
    "\"No \"Nick \"Nick please,\" said Harry, \"I really need to talk to Harry. Can we go in here?\" ",
    "Harry opened the door of the nearest classroom and Nearly Headless Nick sighed. ",
    "\"Oh very well,\" Harry said, looking resigned. \"I can't pretend I haven't been expecting it.\" ",
    "Harry was holding the door of the nearest classroom open for Harry, but Harry drifted through the wall instead. ",
    "\"Expecting what?\" Harry asked, as Harry closed the door of the nearest classroom. ",
    "\"You to come and find me,\" said Nearly Headless Nick, now gliding over to the window and looking out at the darkening grounds. \"It happens, sometimes ... when somebody has suffered a ... loss.\" ",
    "\"Well,\" said Harry, refusing to be deflected. \"You were right, I've -- I've come to find you.\" ",
    "Nearly Headless Nick said nothing. ",
    "\"It's -- \" said Harry, who was finding this more awkward than Harry had anticipated, \"it's just -- you're dead. But you're still here, aren't you?Nearly Headless Nick Nearly Headless Nick sighed and continued to gaze out at the darkening grounds. ",
    "\"That's right, isn't it?\" Harry urged Nearly Headless Nick. \"You died, but I'm talking to you... You can walk around Hogwarts and everything, can't you?\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Nearly Headless Nick quietly, \"I walk and talk, yes.\" ",
    "\"So, you came back, didn't you?\" said Harry urgently. \"People can come back, right? As ghosts. People don't have to disappear completely. Well?\" Harry added impatiently, when Nearly Headless Nick continued to say nothing. ",
    "Nearly Headless Nick Nearly Headless Nick hesitated, then said, \"Not everyone can come back as a ghost.\" ",
    "\"What d'you mean?\" said Harry quickly. ",
    "\"Only ... only wizards.\" ",
    "\"Oh,\" said Harry, and Harry almost laughed with relief. \"Well, that's okay then, the person I'm asking about is a wizard. So Harry can come back, right?\" ",
    "Nearly Headless Nick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at Harry. \"Harry won't come back.\" ",
    "\"Who?\" ",
    "\"Sirius Black,\" said Nearly Headless Nick. ",
    "\"But you did!\" said Harry angrily. \"You came back -- you're dead and you didn't disappear -- \" ",
    "\"Wizards can leave an imprint of \" ",
    "\"Wizards upon the earth, to walk palely where \" ",
    "\"Wizards living selves once trod,\" said Nearly Headless Nick miserably. \"But very few wizards choose that path.\" ",
    "\"Why not?\" said Harry. \"Anyway -- it doesn't matter -- Sirius won't care if it's unusual, Harry'll come back, I know Harry will!\" ",
    "And so strong was Harry belief that Harry actually turned Harry head to check the door, sure, for a split second, that Harry was going to see Sirius, pearly white and transparent but beaming, walking through it toward Harry. ",
    "\"Harry will not come back,\" repeated Nearly Headless Nick quietly. \"Harry will have ... gone on.\" ",
    "\"What d'you mean, 'gone on'?\" said Harry quickly. \"Gone on where? Listen -- what happens when you die, anyway? Where do you go? Why doesn't everyone come back? Why isn't this place full of ghosts? Why -- ?\" ",
    "\"I cannot answer,\" said Nearly Headless Nick. ",
    "\"You're dead, aren't you?\" said Harry exasperatedly. \"Who can answer better than you?\" ",
    "\"I was afraid of death,\" said Nearly Headless Nick. \"I chose to remain behind. I sometimes wonder whether I oughtn't to have ... Well, that is neither here nor there... In fact, I am neither here nor there...\" Harry gave a small sad chuckle. \"I know nothing of the secrets of death, ",
    "Harry, for I chose my feeble imitation of life instead. I believe learned wizards study the matter in the Department of Mysteries -- \" ",
    "\"Don't talk to me about this place!\" said Harry fiercely. ",
    "\"I am sorry not to have been more help,\" said Nearly Headless Nick gently. \"Well ... well, do excuse me ... the feast, you know ...\" ",
    "And Harry left the room, leaving Harry there alone, gazing blankly at the wall through which Nearly Headless Nick had disappeared. ",
    "Harry felt almost as though Harry had lost Harry godfather all over again in losing the hope that Harry might be able to see or speak to Harry once more. Harry walked slowly and miserably back up through the empty castle, wondering whether Harry would ever feel cheerful again. ",
    "Harry had turned the corner toward the Fat Lady's corridor when Harry saw somebody up ahead fastening a note to a board on the wall. A second glance showed Harry that it was Luna. There were no good hiding places nearby, Luna was bound to have heard Harry footsteps, and in any case, Harry could hardly muster the energy to avoid anyone at the moment. ",
    "\"Hello,\" said Luna vaguely, glancing around at Harry as Luna stepped back from the notice. ",
    "\"How come you're not at \"The feast?\" Harry asked. ",
    "\"Well, I've lost most of my possessions,\" said Luna serenely. \"People take People and hide People, you know. But as it's the last night, I really do need People back, so I've been putting up signs.\" ",
    "Luna gestured toward a board on the wall, upon which, sure enough, Luna had pinned a list of all Luna missing books and clothes, with a plea for a list of all her missing books and clothes return. ",
    "An odd feeling rose in Harry -- an emotion quite different from the anger and grief that had filled Harry since Sirius's death. It was a few moments before Harry realized that Harry was feeling sorry for Luna. ",
    "\"How come people hide your stuff?\" Harry asked Luna, frowning. ",
    "\"Oh ... well ...\" Luna shrugged. \"I think people think I'm a bit odd, you know. Some people call me 'Loony' Lovegood, actually.\" ",
    "Harry looked at Luna and the new feeling of pity intensified rather painfully. ",
    "\"That's no reason for people to take your things,\" Harry said flatly. \"D'you want help finding D'you?\" ",
    "\"Oh no,\" Luna said, smiling at Harry. \"D'you'll come back, D'you always do in the end. It was just that I wanted to pack tonight. Anyway ... why aren't you at \"The feast?\" ",
    "Harry shrugged. \"Just didn't feel like it.\" ",
    "\"No,\" said Luna, observing \" ",
    "Harry with those oddly misty, protuberant eyes. \"I don't suppose you do. ",
    "That man the Death Eaters killed was your godfather, wasn't That man the Death Eaters killed? Ginny told me.\" ",
    "Harry nodded curtly, but found that for some reason Harry did not mind Luna talking about Sirius. Harry had just remembered that Luna too could see thestrals. ",
    "\"Have you ...\" Harry began. \"I mean, who ... has anyone you've known ever died?\" ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Luna simply, \"my mother. Luna was a quite extraordinary witch, you know, but Luna did like to experiment and one of Luna spells went rather badly wrong one day. I was nine.\" ",
    "\"I'm sorry,\" Harry mumbled. ",
    "\"Yes, it was rather horrible,\" said Luna conversationally. \"I still feel very sad about it sometimes. But I've still got Dad. And anyway, it's not as though I'll never see Mum again, is it?\" ",
    "\"Er -- isn't it?\" said Harry uncertainly. ",
    "Luna shook Luna head in disbelief. \"Oh, come on. You heard them, just behind the veil, didn't you?\" ",
    "\"You mean ...\" ",
    "\"In that room with the archway. them were just lurking out of sight, that's all. You heard them.\" ",
    "them looked at each other. Luna was smiling slightly. Harry did not know what to say, or to think. Luna believed so many extraordinary things . . . yet Harry had been sure Harry had heard voices behind the veil too... ",
    "\"Are you sure you don't want me to help you look for your stuff?\" Harry said. ",
    "\"Oh no,\" said Luna. \"No, I think I'll just go down and have some pudding and wait for it all to turn up... It always does in the end... Well, have a nice holiday, Harry.\" ",
    "\"Yeah ... yeah, you too.\" ",
    "Luna walked away from Harry, and as Harry watched Luna go, Harry found that the terrible weight in Harry stomach seemed to have lessened slightly. ",
    "The journey home on the Hogwarts Express next day was eventful in several ways. Firstly, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who had clearly been waiting all week for the opportunity to strike without teacher witnesses, attempted to ambush Harry halfway down the train as Harry made Harry way back from the toilet. The attack might have succeeded had The attack not been for the fact that they unwittingly chose to stage The attack right outside a compartment full of D.A. members, who saw what was happening through the glass and rose as one to rush to Harry's aid. By the time Ernie Macmillan, Hannah Abbott, Susan Bones, Justin  ",
    "Finch-Fletchley, Anthony Goldstein, and Terry Boot had finished using a wide variety of the hexes and jinxes Harry had taught the time Ernie Macmillan, Hannah Abbott, Susan Bones, Justin  ",
    "Finch-Fletchley, Anthony Goldstein, and Terry Boot had finished using a wide variety of the hexes and jinxes Harry, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle resembled nothing so much as three gigantic slugs squeezed into Hogwarts uniforms as Harry, ",
    "Ernie, and Justin hoisted the time Ernie Macmillan, Hannah Abbott, Susan Bones, Justin  ",
    "Finch-Fletchley, Anthony Goldstein, and Terry Boot had finished using a wide variety of the hexes and jinxes Harry into the luggage rack and left the time Ernie Macmillan, Hannah Abbott, Susan Bones, Justin  ",
    "Finch-Fletchley, Anthony Goldstein, and Terry Boot had finished using a wide variety of the hexes and jinxes Harry there to ooze. ",
    "\"I must say, I'm looking forward to seeing Malfoy's mother's face when Malfoy's mother's face gets off the train,\" said Ernie with some satisfaction, as Malfoy's mother's face watched Malfoy squirm above Malfoy's mother's face. Ernie had never quite got over the indignity of Malfoy docking points from Hufflepuff during Ernie brief spell as a member of the Inquisitorial Squad. ",
    "\"Goyle's mum'll be really pleased, though,\" said Ron, who had come to investigate the source of the commotion. \"He's loads betterlooking now... Anyway, Harry, the food trolley's just stopped if you want anything...\" ",
    "Harry thanked the others and accompanied Ron back to the others compartment, where Ron bought a large pile of Cauldron Cakes and Pumpkin Pasties. Hermione was reading the Daily Prophet again, Ginny was doing a quiz in The Quibbler, and Neville was stroking Neville Mimbulus mimbletonia, which had grown a great deal over the year and now made odd crooning noises when touched.

    "Harry and Ron whiled away most of the journey playing wizard chess while Hermione read out snippets from the Daily Prophet It was now full of articles about how to repel dementors, attempts by the Ministry to track down Death Eaters, and hysterical letters claiming that the writer had seen Lord Voldemort walking past their house that very morning. . .

    "\"It hasn't really started yet,\" sighed Hermione gloomily, folding up the newspaper again. \"But It won't be long now...\" ",
    "\"Hey, Harry,\" said Ron, nodding toward the glass window onto the corridor. ",
    "Harry looked around. Cho was passing, accompanied by Marietta Edgecombe, who was wearing a balaclava. Cho and Cho's eyes met for a moment. Cho blushed and kept walking. Harry looked back down at the chessboard just in time to see one of Harry pawns chased off its square by Ron's knight. ",
    "\"What's -- er -- going on with you and Cho anyway?\" Ron asked quietly. ",
    "\"Nothing,\" said Harry truthfully. ",
    "\"I -- er -- heard Cho's going out with someone else now,\" said Hermione tentatively. ",
    "Harry was surprised to find that this information did not hurt at all. Wanting to impress Cho seemed to belong to a past that was no longer quite connected with Cho. So much of what Cho had wanted before Sirius's death felt that way these days... The week that had elapsed since Cho had last seen Sirius seemed to have lasted much, much longer: Sirius stretched across two universes, the one with Sirius in Sirius, and the one without. ",
    "\"You're well out of Sirius, mate,\" said Ron forcefully. \"I mean, Cho's quite good-looking and all that, but you want someone a bit more cheerful.\" ",
    "\"Cho's probably cheerful enough with someone else,\" said Harry, shrugging. ",
    "\"Who's Cho with now anyway?\" Ron asked Hermione, but it was Ginny who answered. ",
    "\"Michael Corner,\" Ginny said. ",
    "\"Michael -- but -- \" said Ron, craning around in Ron seat to stare at Ginny. \"But you were going out with Ron!\" ",
    "\"Not anymore,\" said Ginny resolutely. \"Ron didn't like Gryffindor beating Ravenclaw at Quidditch and got really sulky, so I ditched Ron and Ron ran off to Cho Cho instead.\" Ginny scratched Ginny nose absently with the end of Ginny quill, turned The Quibbler upside down, and began marking Ginny answers. Ron looked highly delighted. ",
    "\"Well, I always thought Ron was a bit of an idiot,\" Ron said, prodding Ron queen forward toward Harry's quivering castle. \"Good for you. Just choose someone -- better -- next time.\" ",
    "Ron cast Harry an oddly furtive look as Ron said it. ",
    "\"Well, I've chosen Dean Thomas, would you say Dean Thomas's better?\" asked Ginny vaguely. ",
    "\"WHAT?\" shouted Ron, upending the chessboard. Crookshanks went plunging after the pieces and Hedwig and Pigwidgeon twittered and hooted angrily from overhead. ",
    "As the train slowed down in the approach to King's Cross, Harry thought Harry had never wanted to leave it less. Harry even wondered fleetingly what would happen if Harry simply refused to get off, but remained stubbornly sitting there until the first of September, when it would take Harry back to Hogwarts. When it finally puffed to a standstill, however, Harry lifted down  ",
    "Hedwig's cage and prepared to drag Harry trunk from the train as usual. ",
    "When the ticket inspector signaled to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that it was safe to walk through the magical barrier between platforms nine and ten, however, Harry found a surprise awaiting Harry on the other side: a group of people standing there to greet Harry whom Harry had not expected at all. ",
    "There was Mad-Eye Moody, looking quite as sinister with Harry bowler hat pulled low over Harry magical eye as Harry would have done without it, Harry gnarled hands clutching a long staff, Harry body wrapped in a voluminous traveling cloak. Tonks stood just behind Harry, Tonks bright bubble-gum-pink hair gleaming in the sunlight filtering through the dirty glass station ceiling, wearing heavily patched jeans and a bright purple T-shirt bearing the legend THE WEIRD SISTERS. Next to Tonks was Lupin, Tonks face pale, Tonks hair graying, a long and threadbare overcoat covering a shabby jumper and trousers. At the front of the group stood Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, dressed in their Muggle best, and Fred and George, who were both wearing brand-new jackets in some lurid green, scaly material. ",
    "\"Ron, Ginny!\" called Mrs. Weasley, hurrying forward and hugging Mrs. Weasley children tightly. \"Oh, and Harry dear -- how are you?\" ",
    "\"Fine,\" lied Harry, as Mrs. Weasley pulled Harry into a tight embrace. Over Mrs. Weasley shoulder Harry saw Ron goggling at the twins' new clothes. ",
    "\"What are they supposed to be?\" Harry asked, pointing at the jackets. ",
    "\"Finest dragon skin, little bro,\" said Fred, giving Harry zip a little tweak. \"Business is booming and we thought we'd treat we.\" ",
    "\"Hello, Harry,\" said Lupin, as Mrs. Weasley let go of Harry and turned to greet Hermione. ",
    "\"Hi,\" said Harry. \"I didn't expect ... what are you all doing here?\" ",
    "\"Well,\" said Lupin with a slight smile, \"we thought we might have a little chat with your aunt and uncle before letting your aunt and uncle take you home.\" ",
    "\"I dunno if that's a good idea,\" said Harry at once. ",
    "\"Oh, I think it is,\" growled Moody, who had limped a little closer. \"That'll be them, will it, Potter?\" ",
    "Harry pointed with Harry thumb over Harry shoulder; his magical eye was evidently peering through the back of Harry head and Harry bowler hat. Harry leaned an inch or so to the left to see where his magical eye was pointing and there, sure enough, were the three Dursleys, who looked positively appalled to see Harry's reception committee. ",
    "\"Ah, Harry!\" said Mr. Weasley, turning from Hermione's parents, whom Harry had been greeting enthusiastically, and who were taking it in turns to hug Hermione. \"Well -- shall we do it, then?\" ",
    "\"Yeah, I reckon so, Arthur,\" said Mad-Eye Moody. ",
    "Arthur and Mr. Weasley took the lead across the station toward the place where the Dursleys stood, apparently rooted to the floor. Hermione disengaged Hermione gently from Hermione mother to join the group. ",
    "\"Good afternoon,\" said Mr. Weasley pleasantly to Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt right in front of Mr. Weasley. \"You might remember me, my name's Arthur Weasley.\" ",
    "As Mr. Weasley had singlehandedly demolished most of the Dursleys living room two years previously, ",
    "Harry would have been very surprised if Uncle Vernon had forgotten Uncle Vernon. Sure enough, Uncle Vernon turned a deeper shade of puce and glared at Mr. Weasley, but chose not to say anything, partly, perhaps, because the Dursleys were outnumbered two to one. Aunt Petunia looked both frightened and embarrassed. Aunt Petunia kept glancing around, as though terrified somebody Aunt Petunia knew would see Aunt Petunia in such company. Dudley, meanwhile, seemed to be trying to look small and insignificant, a feat at which Dudley was failing extravagantly. ",
    "\"We thought We'd just have a few words with you about Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley, still smiling. ",
    "\"Yeah,\" growled Mad-Eye Moody. \"About how Dudley's treated when Dudley's at your place.\" ",
    "Uncle Vernon's mustache seemed to bristle with indignation. Possibly because the bowler hat gave Dudley the entirely mistaken impression that Dudley was dealing with a kindred spirit, Dudley addressed Dudley to Mad-Eye Moody. ",
    "\"I am not aware that it is any of your business what goes on in my house -- \" ",
    "\"I expect what you're not aware of would fill several books, Dursley,\" growled Moody. ",
    "\"Anyway, that's not the point,\" interjected Tonks, whose pink hair seemed to offend Aunt Petunia more than all the rest put together, for Aunt Petunia closed Aunt Petunia eyes ",
    "rather than look at Aunt Petunia. \"The point is, if we find out you've been horrible to Harry -- \" ",
    "\" -- and make no mistake, we'll hear about it,\" added Lupin pleasantly. ",
    "\"Yes,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"even if you won't let Harry use the fellytone -- \" ",
    "\" Telephone ,\" whispered Hermione. ",
    "\"Yeah, if we get any hint that Potter's been mistreated in any way, you'll have we to answer to,\" said Mad-Eye Moody. ",
    "Uncle Vernon swelled ominously. Uncle Vernon sense of outrage seemed to outweigh even Uncle Vernon fear of this bunch of oddballs. ",
    "\"Are you threatening me, sir?\" sir said, so loudly that passersby actually turned to stare. ",
    "\"Yes, I am,\" said Mad-Eye, who seemed rather pleased that Uncle Vernon had grasped this fact so quickly. ",
    "\"And do I look like the kind of man who can be intimidated?\" barked Uncle Vernon. ",
    "\"Well ...\" said Mad-Eye Moody, pushing back his bowler hat to reveal his magical eye. Uncle Vernon leapt backward in horror and collided painfully with a luggage trolley. \"Yes, I'd have to say you do, Dursley.\" ",
    "Uncle Vernon turned from Uncle Vernon to Harry. \"So, Potter ... give we a shout if you need we. If we don't hear from you for three days in a row, well send someone along...\" ",
    "Aunt Petunia whimpered piteously. It could not have been plainer that she was thinking of what the neighbors would say if the neighbors caught sight of these people marching up the garden path. ",
    "\" T3ye, then, Potter,\" said Mad-Eye Moody, grasping Harry's shoulder for a moment with a gnarled hand. ",
    "\"Take care, Harry,\" said Lupin quietly. \"Keep in touch.\" ",
    "HarryHarry, we'll have you away from there as soon as we can,Mr. Weasley whispered, hugging Mr. Weasley again. ",
    "\"we'll see you soon, mate,\" said Ron anxiously, shaking Harry's hand. ",
    "\"Really soon, Harry,\" said Hermione earnestly. \"we promise.Harry Harry nodded. Harry somehow could not find words to tell them what it meant to Harry, to see them all ranged there, on Harry side. Instead Harry smiled, raised a hand in farewell, turned around, and led the way out of the station toward the sunlit street, with Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley hurrying along in Harry wake.
