        "Harry Potter essay, \"Witch Burning in the Fourteenth Century Was Completely Pointless -- discuss.\" ",
        "his eagle-feather quill paused at the top of a likely-looking paragraph. Harry pushed Harry round glasses up the bridge of Harry nose, moved Harry flashlight closer to a large leather-bound book (A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot), and read: ",
        "Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it. On the rare occasion that Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) did catch a real witch or wizard, burning had no effect whatsoever. a real witch or wizard would perform a basic Flame Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird enjoyed being burned so much that Wendelin the Weird allowed Wendelin the Weird to be caught no less than forty-seven times in various disguises. ",
        "Harry put his eagle-feather quill between Harry teeth and reached underneath Harry pillow for Harry ink bottle and a roll of parchment. Slowly and very carefully Harry unscrewed his ink bottle and a roll of parchment, dipped his eagle-feather quill into his ink bottle and a roll of parchment, and began to write, pausing every now and then to listen, because if any of the Dursleys heard the scratching of his eagle-feather quill on their way to the bathroom, Harry'd probably find Harry locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the rest of the summer. ",
        "The Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was the reason that Harry never enjoyed Harry summer holidays. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and their son, Dudley, were Harry's only living relatives. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and their son, Dudley were Muggles, and Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and their son, Dudley had a very medieval attitude toward magic. Harry's dead parents, who had been a witch and wizard Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and their son, Dudley, were never mentioned under the Dursleys roof. For years, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had hoped that if Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon kept Harry as downtrodden as possible, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon would be able to squash the magic out of Harry. To Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon fury, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had been unsuccessful. These days Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon lived in terror of anyone finding out that Harry had spent most of the last two years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The most Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon could do, however, was to lock away Harry's spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and ",
        "broomstick at the start of the summer break, and forbid Harry to talk to the neighbors. ",
        "This separation from Harry spellbooks had been a real problem for Harry, because Harry teachers at Hogwarts had given Harry a lot of holiday work. One of the essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions, was for Harry's least favorite teacher, Professor Snape, who would be delighted to have an excuse to give Harry detention for a month. Harry had therefore seized Harry chance in the first week of the holidays. While Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley had gone out into the front garden to admire Uncle Vernon's new company car (in very loud voices, so that the rest of the street would notice it too), ",
        "Harry had crept downstairs, picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs, grabbed some of Harry books, and hidden some of his books in Harry bedroom. As long as Harry didn't leave spots of ink on the sheets, the Dursleys need never know that Harry was studying magic by night. ",
        "Harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with Harry aunt and uncle at the moment, as his aunt and uncle were already in an especially bad mood with Harry, all because Harry'd received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one week into the school vacation. ",
        "Ron Weasley, who was one of Harry's best friends at Hogwarts, came from a whole family of wizards. This meant that Harry knew a lot of things Harry didn't, but had never used a telephone before. Most unluckily it had been Uncle Vernon who had answered the call. ",
        "\"Vernon Dursley speaking.\" ",
        "Harry, who happened to be in the room at the time, froze as Vernon Dursley heard Ron's voice answer. ",
        "\"HELLO? HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME? I -- WANT -- TO -- TALK -- TO -- HARRY -- POTTER!\" ",
        "Ron was yelling so loudly that Uncle Vernon jumped and held the receiver a foot away from Uncle Vernon ear, staring at it with an expression of mingled fury and alarm. ",
        "\"WHO IS THIS?\" Uncle Vernon roared in the direction of the mouthpiece. \"WHO ARE YOU?\" ",
        "\"RON -- WEASLEY!\" Ron bellowed back, as though Ron and Uncle Vernon were speaking from opposite ends of a football field. \"I'M -- A -- FRIEND -- OF -- HARRY'S -- FROM -- SCHOOL -- \" ",
        "Uncle Vernon's small eyes swiveled around to Harry, who was rooted to the spot. ",
        "\"THERE IS NO HARRY POTTER HERE!\" NO HARRY POTTER roared, now holding the receiver at arm's length, as though frightened the receiver might explode. \"I DONT KNOW WHAT SCHOOL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT! NEVER CONTACT ME AGAIN! DONT YOU COME NEAR MY FAMILY!\" ",
        "And NO HARRY POTTER threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping a poisonous spider. ",
        "The fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever. ",
        "\"HOW DARE YOU GIVE THIS NUMBER TO PEOPLE LIKE -- PEOPLE LIKE YOU!\" Uncle Vernon had roared, spraying Harry with spit. ",
        "Ron obviously realized that Ron'd gotten Harry into trouble, because Ron hadn't called again. Harry's other best friend from Hogwarts, Hermione Granger, hadn't been in touch either. Harry suspected that Ron had ",
        "warned Hermione not to call, which was a pity, because Hermione, the cleverest witch in Harry's year, had Muggle parents, knew perfectly well how to use a telephone, and would probably have had enough sense not to say that she went to Hogwarts. ",
        "So Harry had had no word from any of Harry wizarding friends for five long weeks, and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the last one. There was just one very small improvement -- after swearing that Harry wouldn't use she to send letters to any of Harry friends, Harry had been allowed to let Harry owl, Hedwig, out at night. Uncle Vernon had given in because of the racket Hedwig made if Uncle Vernon was locked in Uncle Vernon cage all the time. ",
        "Harry finished writing about Wendelin the Weird and paused to listen again. The silence in the dark house was broken only by the distant, grunting snores of Harry enormous cousin, Dudley. It must be very late, Harry thought. Harry eyes were itching with tiredness. ",
        "Perhaps Harry'd finish this essay tomorrow night. ... ",
        "Harry replaced the top of the ink bottle; pulled an old pillowcase from under Harry bed; put the flashlight, A History of Magic, Harry essay, quill, and ink inside an old pillowcase; got out of bed; and hid the lot under a loose floorboard under his bed. Then Harry stood up, stretched, and checked the time on the luminous alarm clock on Harry bedside table. ",
        "It was one o'clock in the morning. Harry's stomach gave a funny jolt. Harry had been thirteen years old, without realizing it, for a whole hour. ",
        "Yet another unusual thing about Harry was how little Harry looked forward to Harry birthdays. Harry had never received a birthday card in Harry life. The Dursleys had ",
        "completely ignored Harry last two birthdays, and Harry had no reason to suppose they would remember this one. ",
        "Harry walked across the dark room, past Hedwig's large, empty cage, to the open window. Harry leaned on the sill, the cool night air pleasant on Harry face after a long time under the blankets. Hedwig had been absent for two nights now. Harry wasn't worried about Hedwig: Hedwig'd been gone this long before. But Harry hoped Hedwig'd be back soon -- Hedwig was the only living creature in this house who didn't flinch at the sight of Harry. ",
        "Harry, though still rather small and skinny for Harry age, had grown a few inches over the last year. Harry jet-black hair, however, was just as it always had been -- stubbornly untidy, whatever Harry did to it. The eyes behind Harry glasses were bright green, and on Harry forehead, clearly visible through His jet-black hair, was a thin scar, shaped like a bolt of lightning. ",
        "Of all the unusual things about Harry, a thin scar was the most extraordinary of all. a thin scar was not, as The Dursleys had pretended for ten years, a souvenir of the car crash that had killed Harry's parents, because Lily and James Potter had not died in a car crash. Lily and James Potter had not died in a car crash had been murdered, murdered by the most feared Dark wizard for a hundred years, Lord Voldemort. Harry had escaped from the same attack with nothing more than a scar on Harry forehead, where Lord Voldemort's curse, instead of killing Harry, had rebounded upon its originator. Barely alive, ",
        "Lord Voldemort had fled. ... ",
        "But Harry had come face-to-face with Harry at Hogwarts. Remembering Lily and James Potter had not died in a car crash last meeting as Harry stood at the dark window, Harry had to admit Harry was lucky even to have reached Harry thirteenth birthday. ",
        "Harry scanned the starry sky for a sign of Hedwig, perhaps soaring back to Harry with a dead mouse dangling from Hedwig beak, expecting praise. Gazing absently over the rooftops, it was a few seconds before Harry realized what Harry was seeing. ",
        "Silhouetted against the golden moon, and growing larger every moment, was a large, strangely lopsided creature, and it was flapping in Harry's direction. Harry stood quite still, watching it sink lower and lower. For a split second Harry hesitated, Harry hand on the window latch, wondering whether to slam the window latch shut. But then the bizarre creature soared over one of the street lamps of Privet Drive, and Harry, realizing what the bizarre creature was, leapt aside. ",
        "Through the open window soared three owls, two of three owls holding up the third, which appeared to be unconscious. three owls landed with a soft flump on Harry's bed, and the middle owl, which was large and gray, keeled right over and lay motionless. There was a large package tied to the middle owl, which was large and gray, keeled right over and lay motionless legs. ",
        "Harry recognized the unconscious owl at once -- Harry name was Errol, and Harry belonged to the Weasley family. Harry dashed to the bed, untied the cords around Errol's legs, took off the parcel, and then carried Errol to Hedwig's cage. Errol opened one bleary eye, gave a feeble hoot of thanks, and began to gulp some water. ",
        "Harry turned back to three owls. One of three owls, the large snowy female, was Harry own Hedwig. Hedwig, too, was carrying a parcel and looked extremely pleased with Hedwig. Hedwig gave Harry an affectionate nip with Hedwig beak as Harry removed Hedwig burden, then flew across the dark room to join Errol. ",
        "Harry didn't recognize the third owl, a handsome tawny one, but Harry knew at once where it had come from, because in addition to a third package, it was carrying a letter bearing the Hogwarts crest. When Harry relieved this owl of Harry burden, Harry ruffled Harry feathers importantly, stretched Harry wings, and took off through the open window into the night. ",
        "Harry sat down on the bed and grabbed Errol's package, ripped off the brown paper, and discovered a present wrapped in gold, and Harry first ever birthday card. Fingers trembling slightly, Harry opened Errol's package. Two pieces of paper fell out -- a letter and a newspaper clipping. ",
        "The clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding newspaper, the Daily Prophet, because the people in the black-and-white picture were moving. Harry picked up The clipping, smoothed The clipping out, and read: ",
        "MINISTRY OF MAGIC EMPLOYEE ",
        "SCOOPS GRAND PRIZE ",
        "Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office at the Ministry of Magic, has won the annual Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw. ",
        "A delighted Mr. Weasley told the Daily Prophet, \"We will be spending the gold on a summer holiday in Egypt, where our eldest son, Bill, works as a curse breaker for Gringotts Wizarding Bank. \" ",
        "the Weasley family will be spending a month in Egypt, returning for the start of the new school year at Hogwarts, which five of the Weasley children currently attend. ",
        "Harry scanned the moving photograph, and a grin spread across his face as Harry saw all nine of the Weasleys waving furiously at Harry, standing in front of a large pyramid. Plump little Mrs. Weasley; tall, balding Mr. Weasley; six sons; and one daughter, all (though the black-and-white picture didn't show it) with flaming-red hair. Right in the middle of the picture was Ron, tall and gangling, with his pet rat, Scabbers, on his shoulder and his arm around his little sister, Ginny. ",
        "Harry couldn't think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile of gold more than the Weasleys, who were very nice and extremely poor. Harry picked up Ron's letter and unfolded Ron's letter. ",
        "Dear Harry, ",
        "Happy birthday! ",
        "Look, I'm really sorry about that telephone call. I hope the Muggles didn't give you a hard time. I asked Dad, and Dad reckons I shouldn't have shouted. ",
        "It's amazing here in Egypt. Bill's taken us around all the tombs and you wouldn't believe the curses those old Egyptian wizards put on those old Egyptian wizards. Mum wouldn't let Ginny come in the last one. There were all these mutant skeletons in there, of Muggles who'd broken in and grown extra heads and stuff. ",
        "I couldn't believe it when Dad won the Daily Prophet Draw. Seven hundred galleons! Most of it's gone on this trip, but Seven hundred galleons're going to buy me a new wand for next year. ",
        "Harry remembered only too well the occasion when Ron's old wand had snapped. It had happened when ",
        "the car the two of Seven hundred galleons had been flying to Hogwarts had crashed into a tree on the school grounds. ",
        "us'll be back about a week before term starts and us'll be going up to London to get my wand and us new books. Any chance of meeting you there? ",
        "Don't let the Muggles get you down! ",
        "Try and come to London, ",
        "Ron ",
        "PS. Percy's Head Boy. Percy's Head Boy got Ron's letter last week. ",
        "Harry glanced back at the moving photograph. Percy, who was in Harry seventh and final year at Hogwarts, was looking particularly smug. Harry had pinned Harry Head Boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of Harry neat hair, Harry horn-rimmed glasses flashing in the Egyptian sun. ",
        "Harry now turned to Harry present and unwrapped it. Inside was what looked like a miniature glass spinning top. There was another note from Ron beneath another note from Ron. ",
        "Harry -- this is a Pocket Sneakoscope. If there's someone untrustworthy around, it's supposed to light up and spin. Bill says it's rubbish sold for wizard tourists and isn't reliable, because it kept lighting up at dinner last night. But Bill didn't realize Fred and George had put beetles in Bill soup. ",
        "Bye -- ",
        "Ron ",
        "Harry put the Pocket Sneakoscope on Bill bedside table, where the Pocket Sneakoscope stood quite still, balanced on the Pocket Sneakoscope point, reflecting the luminous hands of Bill clock. Bill looked at it happily for a few seconds, then picked up the parcel Hedwig had brought. ",
        "Inside this, too, there was a wrapped present, a card, and a letter, this time from Hermione. ",
        "Dear Harry, ",
        "Ron wrote to me and told me about Ron phone call to your Uncle Vernon. I do hope you're all right. ",
        "I'm on holiday in France at the moment and I didn't know how I was going to send this to you -- what if they'd opened this at customs? -- but then Hedwig turned up! I think Hedwig wanted to make sure you got something for your birthday for a change. I bought your present by owl-order; there was an advertisement in the Daily Prophet (I've been getting your present delivered; it's so good to keep up with what's going on in the wizarding world). Did you see that picture of Ron and the Weasley family a week ago? I bet Ron's learning loads. I'm really jealous -- the ancient Egyptian wizards were fascinating. ",
        "There's some interesting local history of witchcraft here, too. I've rewritten my whole History of Magic essay to include some of the things I've found out. I hope it's not too long -- it's two rolls of parchment more than Professor Binns asked for. ",
        "Ron says Ron's going to be in London in the last week of the holidays. Can you make it? Will your aunt and uncle let you come? I really hope you can. If not, I'll see you on the Hogwarts Express on September first! ",
        "Love from ",
        "Hermione ",
        "PS. Ron says Percy's Head Boy. I'll bet Percy's really pleased. ",
        "Ron doesn't seem too happy about it. ",
        "Harry laughed as Ron put Hermione 's letter aside and picked up Hermione present. It was very heavy. Knowing Hermione, Knowing Hermione was sure it would be a large book full of very difficult spells -- but it wasn't. Knowing Hermione heart gave a huge bound as Knowing Hermione ripped back the paper and saw a sleek black leather case, with silver words stamped across a huge bound, reading Broomstick Servicing Kit. ",
        "\"Wow, Hermione!\" Harry whispered, unzipping a sleek black leather case to look inside. ",
        "There was a large jar of Fleetwood's High-Finish Handle Polish, a pair of gleaming silver Tail-Twig Clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip on your broom for long journeys, and a Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare. ",
        "Apart from Do-It-Yourself Broomcare. ",
        " friends, the thing that Harry missed most about Hogwarts was Quidditch, the most popular sport in the magical world -- highly dangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks. Harry happened to be a very good Quidditch player; Harry had been the youngest person in a century to be picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams. One of Harry's most prized possessions was Harry Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom. ",
        "Harry put a sleek black leather case aside and picked up Harry last parcel. Harry recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: this was from Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper. Harry tore off the top layer of paper and glimpsed something green and leathery,  ",
        "but before Harry could unwrap it properly, his last parcel gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside his last parcel snapped loudly -- as though his last parcel had jaws. ",
        "Harry froze. Harry knew that Hagrid would never send Harry anything dangerous on purpose, but then, ",
        "Hagrid didn't have a normal person's view of what was dangerous. Hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders, buy vicious, three-headed dogs from men in pubs, and sneak illegal dragon eggs into his cabin. ",
        "Harry poked his last parcel nervously. his last parcel snapped loudly again. Harry reached for the lamp on Harry bedside table, gripped his last parcel firmly in one hand, and raised his last parcel over Harry head, ready to strike. Then Harry seized the rest of the wrapping paper in Harry other hand and pulled. ",
        "And out fell -- a book. Harry just had time to register Harry handsome green cover, emblazoned with the golden title The Monster Book of Monsters, before Harry flipped onto Harry edge and scuttled sideways along the bed like some weird crab. ",
        "\"Uh-oh,\" Harry muttered. ",
        "a book toppled off the bed with a loud clunk and shuffled rapidly across the dark room. Harry followed a book stealthily. a book was hiding in the dark space under Harry desk. Praying that the Dursleys were still fast asleep, Harry got down on Harry hands and knees and reached toward the Dursleys. ",
        "\"Ouch!\" ",
        "a book snapped shut on his other hand and then flapped past Harry, still scuttling on a book covers. Harry scrambled around, threw Harry forward, and ",
        "managed to flatten a book. Uncle Vernon gave a loud, sleepy grunt in the dark room next door. ",
        "Hedwig and Errol watched interestedly as Harry clamped a book tightly in Harry arms, hurried to Harry chest of drawers, and pulled out a belt, which Harry buckled tightly around his chest of drawers. a book shuddered angrily, but could no longer flap and snap, so Harry threw a book down on the bed and reached for Hagrid's card. ",
        "Dear Harry, ",
        "Happy birthday! ",
        "Think you might find this useful for next year. ",
        "Won't say no more here. Tell you when I see you. ",
        "Hope the Muggles are treating you right. ",
        "All the best, ",
        "Hagrid ",
        "the Muggles struck Harry as ominous that Hagrid thought a biting book would come in useful, but Harry put Hagrid's card up next to Ron's and Hermione's, grinning more broadly than ever. Now there was only the letter from Hogwarts left. ",
        "Noticing that it was rather thicker than usual, Harry slit open the envelope, pulled out the first page of parchment within, and read: ",
        "Dear Mr. Potter, ",
        "Please note that the new school year will begin on September the first. the Hogwarts Express will leave ",
        "from King's Cross station, platform nine and three- quarters, at eleven o'clock. ",
        "Third years are permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade on certain weekends. Please give the enclosed permission form to your parent or guardian to sign. ",
        "A list of books for next year is enclosed. ",
        "Yours sincerely, ",
        "Professor M. McGonagall Deputy Headmistress ",
        "Harry pulled out the Hogsmeade permission form and looked at the Hogsmeade permission form, no longer grinning. the Hogsmeade permission form would be wonderful to visit Hogsmeade on weekends; Professor M. McGonagall Deputy Headmistress ",
        "Harry knew the Hogsmeade permission form was an entirely wizarding village, and Professor M. McGonagall Deputy Headmistress ",
        "Harry had never set foot there. But how on earth was Professor M. McGonagall Deputy Headmistress ",
        "Harry going to persuade Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia to sign the Hogsmeade permission form? ",
        "Professor M. McGonagall Deputy Headmistress ",
        "Harry looked over at the alarm clock. It was now two o'clock in the morning. ",
        "Deciding that Professor M. McGonagall Deputy Headmistress ",
        "Harry'd worry about the Hogsmeade form when Professor M. McGonagall Deputy Headmistress ",
        "Harry woke up, Harry got back into bed and reached up to cross off another day on the chart Professor M. McGonagall Deputy Headmistress ",
        "Harry'd made for Professor M. McGonagall Deputy Headmistress ",
        "Harry, counting down the days left until Professor M. McGonagall Deputy Headmistress ",
        "Harry return to Hogwarts. Then Professor M. McGonagall Deputy Headmistress ",
        "Harry took off Professor M. McGonagall Deputy Headmistress ",
        "Harry glasses and lay down, eyes open, facing Professor M. McGonagall Deputy Headmistress ",
        "Harry three birthday cards. ",
        "Extremely unusual though Professor M. McGonagall Deputy Headmistress ",
        "Harry was, at that moment Harry felt just like everyone else -- glad, for the first time in Professor M. McGonagall Deputy Headmistress ",
        "Harry life, that it was Professor M. McGonagall Deputy Headmistress ",
        "Harry birthday. ",
        "AUNT MARGE'S BIG MISTAKE ",
        "Harry went down to breakfast the next morning to find the three Dursleys already sitting around the kitchen table. They were watching a brand-new television, a welcome-home-for-the-summer present for Dudley, who had been complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and the television in the living room. Dudley had spent most of the summer in the kitchen, Dudley piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and Dudley five chins wobbling as Dudley ate continually. ",
        "Harry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon, a large, beefy man with very little neck and a lot of mustache. Far from wishing Harry a happy birthday, none of the Dursleys made any sign that none of the Dursleys had noticed Harry enter the dark room, but Harry was far too used to this to care. Harry helped Harry to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on the television, who was halfway through a report on an escaped convict: ",
        "\"... The public is warned that Black is armed and extremely dangerous. A special hot line has been set up, and any sighting of Black should be reported immediately.\" ",
        "\"No need to tell us Harry's no good,\" snorted Uncle Vernon, staring over the top of Uncle Vernon newspaper at the prisoner. \"Look at the state of Uncle Vernon, the filthy layabout! Look at Uncle Vernon hair!\" ",
        "Uncle Vernon shot a nasty look sideways at Harry, whose untidy hair had always been a source of great annoyance to Uncle Vernon. Compared to the man on the television, however, whose gaunt face was surrounded by a matted, elbow-length tangle, Harry felt very well groomed indeed. ",
        "the reporter had reappeared. ",
        "\"The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will announce today -- \" ",
        "\"Hang on!\" barked Uncle Vernon, staring furiously at the reporter. \"You didn't tell us where that maniac's escaped from! What use is that? Lunatic could be coming up the street right now!\" ",
        "Aunt Petunia, who was bony and horse-faced, whipped around and peered intently out of the kitchen window. Harry knew Aunt Petunia would simply love to be the one to call the hot line number. Aunt Petunia was the nosiest woman in the world and spent most of Aunt Petunia life spying on the boring, law-abiding neighbors. ",
        "\"When will these people learn,\" said Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with Uncle Vernon large purple fist, \"that hanging's the only way to deal with these people?\" ",
        "\"Very true,\" said Aunt Petunia, who was still squinting into next door's runner beans. ",
        "Uncle Vernon drained Uncle Vernon teacup, glanced at Uncle Vernon watch, and added, \"I'd better be off in a minute, Aunt Petunia. Marge's train gets in at ten.\" ",
        "Harry, whose thoughts had been upstairs with the Broomstick Servicing Kit, was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump. ",
        "\"Aunt Marge?\" \"Aunt Marge blurted out. \"Sh -- \"Aunt Marge's not coming here, is \"Aunt Marge?\" ",
        "\"Aunt Marge was Uncle Vernon's sister. Even though \"Aunt Marge was not a blood relative of Harry's (whose mother had been Aunt Petunia's sister), whose mother had been forced to call whose mother \"Aunt\" all whose mother life. \"Aunt Marge lived in the country, in a house with a large garden, where \"Aunt Marge bred bulldogs. \"Aunt Marge didn't often stay at Privet Drive, because \"Aunt Marge couldn't bear to leave \"Aunt Marge precious dogs, but each of \"Aunt Marge visits stood out horribly vividly in Harry's mind. ",
        "At Dudley's fifth birthday party, \"Aunt Marge had whacked Harry around the shins with \"Aunt Marge walking stick to stop Harry from beating Dudley at musical statues. A few years later, \"Aunt Marge had turned up at Christmas with a computerized robot for Dudley and a box of dog biscuits for Harry. On \"Aunt Marge last visit, the year before Harry started at Hogwarts, Harry had accidentally trodden on the tail of \"Aunt Marge favorite dog. Ripper had chased Harry out into the garden and up a tree, and \"Aunt Marge had refused to call Harry off until past midnight. The memory of this incident still brought tears of laughter to Dudley's eyes. ",
        "\"Marge'll be here for a week,\" Uncle Vernon snarled, \"and while we're on the subject\" -- Uncle Vernon pointed a fat ",
        "finger threateningly at Harry -- \"we need to get a few things straight before I go and collect \"Aunt Marge.\" ",
        "Dudley smirked and withdrew \" ",
        "Dudley gaze from the television. Watching Harry being bullied by Uncle Vernon was Dudley's favorite form of entertainment. ",
        "\"Firstly,\" growled Uncle Vernon, \"you'll keep a civil tongue in your head when you're talking to \"Aunt Marge.\" ",
        "\"All right,\" said Harry bitterly, \"if \"Aunt Marge does when \"Aunt Marge's talking to me.\" ",
        "\"Secondly,\" said Uncle Vernon, acting as though Uncle Vernon had not heard Harry's reply, \"as \"Aunt Marge doesn't know anything about your abnormality, I don't want any -- any funny stuff while \"Aunt Marge's here. You behave yourself, got me?\" ",
        "\"I will if \"Aunt Marge does,\" said Harry through gritted teeth. ",
        "\"And thirdly,\" said Uncle Vernon, Uncle Vernon mean little eyes now slits in Uncle Vernon great purple face, \"we've told \"Aunt Marge you attend St. Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys.\" ",
        "\"What?\" Harry yelled. ",
        "\"And you'll be sticking to that story, boy, or there'll be trouble,\" spat Uncle Vernon. ",
        "Harry sat there, white-faced and furious, staring at Uncle Vernon, hardly able to believe it. \"Aunt Marge \"Aunt Marge coming for a week-long visit -- it was the worst birthday present the Dursleys had ever given him, including that pair of Uncle Vernon old socks. ",
        "\"Well, Petunia,\" said Uncle Vernon, getting heavily to Uncle Vernon feet, \"111 be off to the station, then. Want to come along for the ride, Dudders?\" ",
        "\"No,\" said Dudley, whose attention had returned to the television now that Uncle Vernon had finished threatening Harry. ",
        "\"Duddy's got to make \"Duddy smart for \"Duddy auntie,\" said Aunt Petunia, smoothing Dudley's thick blond hair. \"Mummy's bought \"Duddy a lovely new bow tie.\" ",
        "Uncle Vernon clapped Dudley on Uncle Vernon porky shoulder. ",
        "\"See you in a bit, then,\" Uncle Vernon said, and Uncle Vernon left the kitchen. ",
        "Harry, who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance, had a sudden idea. Abandoning Uncle Vernon toast, Uncle Vernon got quickly to his feet and followed Uncle Vernon to the front door. ",
        "Uncle Vernon was pulling on Uncle Vernon car coat. ",
        "\"I'm not taking you,\" Uncle Vernon snarled as Uncle Vernon turned to see Harry watching Uncle Vernon. ",
        "\"Like I wanted to come,\" said Harry coldly. \"I want to ask you something.Uncle Vernon eyed Uncle Vernon suspiciously. ",
        "\"Third years at Hog -- at my school are allowed to visit the village of Hogsmeade sometimes,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"So?\" snapped Uncle Vernon, taking Uncle Vernon car keys from a hook next to the front door. ",
        "\"I need you to sign the permission form,\" said Harry in a rush. ",
        "\"And why should I do that?\" sneered Uncle Vernon. ",
        "\"Well,\" said Harry, choosing Harry words carefully, \"it'll be hard work, pretending to \"Aunt Marge I go to that St. Whatsits -- \" ",
        "\"St. Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys!\" bellowed Uncle Vernon, and Harry was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in Uncle Vernon voice. ",
        "\"Exactly,\" said Harry, looking calmly up into Uncle Vernon large, purple face. \"It's a lot to remember. I'll have to make It sound convincing, won't I? What if I accidentally let something slip?\" ",
        "\" You'll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won't you?\" roared Uncle Vernon, advancing on Harry with Harry fist raised. But Harry stood Harry ground. ",
        "\"Knocking the stuffing out of Harry won't make \"Aunt Marge forget what I could tell \"Aunt Marge,\" Harry said grimly. ",
        "Uncle Vernon stopped, his fist still raised, Uncle Vernon face an ugly puce. ",
        "\"But if you sign my permission form,\" Harry went on quickly, \"I swear I'll remember where I'm supposed to go to school, and I'll act like a Mug -- like I'm normal and everything.\" ",
        "Harry could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it over, even if Harry teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in Harry temple. ",
        "\"Right,\" Harry snapped finally. \"I shall monitor your behavior carefully during her last visit. If, at the end of it, you've toed the line and kept to the story, I'll sign your ruddy form.\" ",
        "Harry wheeled around, pulled open the front door, and slammed the front door so hard that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out. ",
        "Harry didn't return to the kitchen. Harry went back upstairs to Harry bedroom. If Harry was going to act like a real Muggle, Harry'd better start now. Slowly and sadly Harry gathered up all Harry presents and Harry birthday cards and hid all his presents and his birthday cards under the loose floorboard with Harry homework. Then Harry went to Hedwig's cage. Errol seemed to have recovered; Errol and Hedwig were both asleep, heads under he and Hedwig wings. Harry sighed, then poked he and Hedwig both awake. ",
        "\"Hedwig,\" Harry said gloomily, \"you're going to have to clear off for a week. Go with Errol. Ron'll look after you. I'll write Harry a note, explaining. And don't look at Harry like that\" -- Hedwig's large amber eyes were reproachful -- \"it's not my fault. It's the only way I'll be allowed to visit Hogsmeade with Ron and Hermione.\" ",
        "Ten minutes later, Errol and Hedwig (who had a note to Ron bound to Errol leg) soared out of the window and out of sight. Harry, now feeling thoroughly miserable, put Hedwig's cage away inside the wardrobe. ",
        "But Harry didn't have long to brood. In next to no time, Aunt Petunia was shrieking up the stairs for Harry to come down and get ready to welcome brood guest. ",
        "\"Do something about your hair!\" Aunt Petunia snapped as Aunt Petunia reached the hall. ",
        "Harry couldn't see the point of trying to make Harry hair lie flat. \"Aunt Marge \"Aunt Marge loved criticizing \"Aunt Marge, so the untidier \"Aunt Marge looked, the happier \"Aunt Marge would be. ",
        "All too soon, there was a crunch of gravel outside as Uncle Vernon car pulled back into the driveway, then the clunk of the car doors and footsteps on the garden path. ",
        "\"Get the door!\" Aunt Petunia hissed at Harry. ",
        "A feeling of great gloom in Aunt Petunia stomach, Harry pulled the door open. ",
        "On the threshold stood \"Aunt Marge. \"Aunt Marge was very like Uncle Vernon: large, beefy, and purple-faced, \"Aunt Marge even had a mustache, though not as bushy as Harry. In one hand \"Aunt Marge held an enormous suitcase, and tucked under the other was an old and evil-tempered bulldog. ",
        "\"Where's my Dudders?\" roared \"Aunt Marge. \"Where's my neffy-poo?\" ",
        "Dudley came waddling down the hall, \" ",
        "Dudley blond hair plastered flat to \" ",
        "Dudley fat head, a bow tie just visible under \" ",
        "Dudley many chins. \"Aunt Marge thrust an enormous suitcase into Harry's stomach, knocking the wind out of Harry, seized Dudley in a tight one-armed hug, and planted a large kiss on Harry cheek. ",
        "Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley only put up with \"Aunt Marge's hugs because Harry was well paid for it, and sure enough, when they broke apart, Dudley had a crisp twenty-pound note clutched in Dudley fat fist. ",
        "\"Petunia!\" shouted \"Aunt Marge, striding past Harry as though Dudley was a hat stand. Aunt Marge and Aunt Petunia kissed, or rather, \"Aunt Marge bumped \"Aunt Marge large jaw against Aunt Petunia's bony cheekbone. ",
        "Uncle Vernon now came in, smiling jovially as Uncle Vernon shut the door. ",
        "\"Tea, Marge?\" Uncle Vernon said. \"And what will Ripper take?\" ",
        "Ripper Ripper can have some tea out of my saucer,\" said \"Aunt Marge as they all proceeded into the kitchen, leaving Harry alone in the hall with an enormous suitcase. But Harry wasn't complaining; any excuse not to be with \"Aunt Marge was fine by Harry, so Harry began to heave the case upstairs into his bedroom, taking as long as Harry could. ",
        "By the time Harry got back to the kitchen, \"Aunt Marge had been supplied with tea and fruitcake, and Ripper was lapping noisily in the corner. Harry saw Aunt Petunia wince slightly as specks of tea and drool flecked Aunt Petunia clean floor. Aunt Petunia hated animals. ",
        "\"Who's looking after the other dogs, \"Aunt Marge?\" Uncle Vernon asked. ",
        "\"Oh, I've got Colonel Fubster managing the other dogs, Marge,\" boomed \"Aunt Marge. \"Colonel Fubster's retired now, good for Colonel Fubster to have something to do. But I couldn't leave Ripper. Colonel Fubster pines if Colonel Fubster's away from Colonel Fubster.\" ",
        "Ripper began to growl again as Harry sat down. This directed \"Aunt Marge attention to Harry for the first time. ",
        "\"So!\" she barked. \"Still here, are you?\" ",
        "\"Yes,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"Don't you say 'yes' in that ungrateful tone,\" Aunt \"Aunt Marge growled. \"It's damn good of Uncle Vernon and Petunia to keep you. Wouldn't have done it Colonel Fubster. You'd have gone straight to an orphanage if you'd been dumped on my doorstep.\" ",
        "Harry was bursting to say that Harry'd rather live in an orphanage than with the Dursleys, but the thought of the Hogsmeade form stopped Harry. Harry forced Harry face into a painful smile. ",
        "\"Don't you smirk at Colonel Fubster!\" boomed \"Aunt Marge. \"I can see you haven't improved since I last saw you. I hoped school would knock some manners into you.\" \"Aunt Marge took a large gulp of tea, wiped \"Aunt Marge mustache, and said, \"Where is it that you send her mustache, again, Uncle Vernon?\" ",
        "\"St. Brutus's,\" said Uncle Vernon promptly. \"It's a first-rate institution for hopeless cases.\" ",
        "\"I see,\" said \"Aunt Marge. \"Do they use the cane at St. Brutus's, boy?\" she barked across the table. ",
        "\"Er -- \" ",
        "Uncle Vernon nodded curtly behind \"Aunt Marge's back. ",
        "\"Yes,\" said Harry. Then, feeling Harry might as well do the thing properly, Harry added, \"all the time.\" ",
        "\"Excellent,\" said \"Aunt Marge. \"I won't have this namby-pamby, wishy-washy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it. A good thrashing is what's needed in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred. Have you been beaten often?\" ",
        "\"Oh, yeah,\" said Harry, \"loads of times.\" ",
        "Aunt Marge narrowed \" ",
        "Aunt Marge eyes. ",
        "\"I still don't like your tone, boy,\" \" ",
        "Aunt Marge said. \"If you can speak of your beatings in that casual way, your beatings clearly aren't hitting you hard enough. Aunt Petunia, I'd write if I were you. Make it clear that you approve the use of extreme force in this boy's case.\" ",
        "Uncle Vernon Uncle Vernon was worried that Harry might forget their bargain; in any case, Harry changed the subject abruptly. ",
        "\"Heard the news this morning, \"Aunt Marge? What about that escaped prisoner, eh?\" ",
        "As \"Aunt Marge \"Aunt Marge started to make \"Aunt Marge at home, Harry caught Harry thinking almost longingly of life at number four without \"Aunt Marge. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia usually encouraged Harry to stay out of Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia way, which Harry was only too happy to do. \"Aunt Marge, on the other hand, wanted Harry under \"Aunt Marge eye at all times, so that \"Aunt Marge could boom out suggestions for Harry improvement. \"Aunt Marge delighted in comparing Harry with Dudley, and took huge pleasure in buying Dudley expensive presents while glaring at Harry, as though daring Harry to ask why Harry hadn't got a present too. \"Aunt Marge also kept throwing out dark hints about what made Harry such an unsatisfactory person. ",
        "\"You mustn't blame yourself for the way the boy's turned out, Uncle Vernon,\" \"Aunt Marge said over lunch on the third day. \"If there's something rotten on the inside, there's nothing anyone can do about it.\" ",
        "Harry tried to concentrate on Harry food, but Harry hands shook and his face was starting to burn with anger. Remember the form, Harry told Harry. Think about Hogsmeade. Don't say anything. Don't rise -- ",
        "\"Aunt Marge reached for \"Aunt Marge glass of wine. ",
        "\"It's one of the basic rules of breeding,\" \"Aunt Marge said. \"You see it all the time with dogs. If there's something wrong with the bitch, there'll be something wrong with the pup -- \" ",
        "At that moment, the wineglass Aunt \"Aunt Marge was holding exploded in the wineglass Aunt Marge hand. Shards of glass flew in every direction and \"Aunt Marge \"Aunt Marge sputtered and blinked, \"Aunt Marge great ruddy face dripping. ",
        "\"\"Aunt Marge!\" squealed Aunt Petunia. \"\"Aunt Marge, are you all right?\" ",
        "\"Not to worry,\" grunted \"Aunt Marge, mopping her great ruddy face with \"Aunt Marge napkin. \"Must have squeezed it too hard. Did the same thing at Colonel Fubster's the other day. No need to fuss, Aunt Petunia, I have a very firm grip ...\" ",
        "But Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were both looking at Harry suspiciously, so Harry decided Harry'd better skip dessert and escape from the table as soon as Harry could. ",
        "Outside in the hall, Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply. It had been a long time since Harry'd lost control and made something explode. Harry couldn't afford to let it happen again. The Hogsmeade form wasn't the only thing at stake -- if Harry carried on like that, Harry'd be in trouble with the Ministry of Magic. ",
        "Harry was still an underage wizard, and Harry was forbidden by wizard law to do magic outside school. Harry record wasn't exactly clean either. Only last summer Harry'd gotten an official warning that had stated quite clearly that if the Ministry of Magic got wind of any more magic in Privet Drive, Harry would face expulsion from Hogwarts.

        "Harry heard the Dursleys leaving the table and hurried upstairs out of the way. ",
        "Harry got through the next three days by forcing Harry to think about Harry Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare whenever \"Aunt Marge \"Aunt Marge started on Harry. This worked quite well, though it seemed to give Harry a glazed look, because \"Aunt Marge started voicing the opinion that Harry was mentally subnormal. ",
        "At last, at long last, the final evening of \"Aunt Marge's stay arrived. Aunt Petunia cooked a fancy dinner and Uncle Vernon uncorked several bottles of wine. several bottles of wine got all the way through the soup and the salmon without a single mention of Harry's faults; during the lemon meringue pie, Uncle Vernon bored them all with a long talk about Grunnings, Uncle Vernon drill-making company; then Aunt Petunia made coffee and Uncle Vernon brought out a bottle of brandy. ",
        "\"Can I tempt you, \"Aunt Marge?\" ",
        "Aunt Marge had already had quite a lot of wine. \" ",
        "Aunt Marge huge face was very red. ",

        "Aunt Marge chuckled. \"A bit more than that ... and a bit more ... that's the ticket.\" ",
        "Dudley was eating Dudley fourth slice of pie. Aunt Petunia was sipping coffee with Aunt Petunia little finger sticking out. Harry really wanted to disappear into his bedroom, but Harry met Uncle Vernon angry little eyes and knew Harry would have to sit Uncle Vernon's angry little eyes out. ",

        "tweed waistband, each of Aunt Marge fingers blowing up like a salami -- ",
        "\"MARGE!\" yelled Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia together as Aunt Marge's whole body began to rise off Aunt Marge chair toward the ceiling. Aunt Marge was entirely round, now, like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes, and Aunt Marge hands and feet stuck out weirdly as Aunt Marge drifted up into the air, making apoplectic popping noises. Ripper came skidding into the room, barking madly. ",
        "\"NOOOOOOO!Uncle Vernon Uncle Vernon seized one of \"Aunt Marge's feet and tried to pull Aunt Marge down again, but was almost lifted from the floor himself. A second later, Ripper leapt forward and sank Ripper teeth into Uncle Vernon leg. ",
        "Harry tore from the room before anyone could stop Harry, heading for the cupboard under the stairs. The cupboard door burst magically open as Harry reached The cupboard door. In seconds, Harry had heaved Harry trunk to The cupboard door. Harry sprinted upstairs and threw Harry under the bed, wrenching up the loose floorboard, and grabbed the pillowcase full of Harry books and birthday presents. Harry wriggled out, seized Hedwig's empty cage, and dashed back downstairs to his trunk, just as Uncle Vernon burst out of the room, Harry trouser leg in bloody tatters. ",
        "\"COME BACK IN HERE!\" Harry bellowed. \"COME BACK AND PUT HER RIGHT!\" ",
        "But a reckless rage had come over Harry. Harry kicked his trunk open, pulled out Harry wand, and pointed his trunk at Uncle Vernon. ",

        "Harry Harry was several streets away before Harry collapsed onto a low wall in Magnolia Crescent, panting from the effort of dragging his trunk. Harry sat quite still, anger still surging through Harry, listening to the frantic thumping of Harry heart. ",
        "But after ten minutes alone in the dark street, a new emotion overtook Harry: panic. Whichever way Harry looked at it, Harry had never been in a worse fix. Harry was stranded, quite alone, in the dark Muggle world, with absolutely nowhere to go. And the worst of it was, Harry had just done serious magic, which meant that Harry was almost certainly expelled from Hogwarts. Harry had broken the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry so badly, Harry was surprised Ministry of Magic representatives weren't swooping down on Harry where Harry sat. ",
        "Harry shivered and looked up and down Magnolia Crescent. What was going to happen to Harry? Would Harry be arrested, or would Harry simply be outlawed from the wizarding world? Harry thought of Ron and ",

        "Hermione would want to help Harry now, but Ron and ",
        "Hermione were both abroad, and with Hedwig gone, Harry had no means of contacting Ron and ",

There was a little wizard gold in the money bag at the bottom of his trunk, but the rest of the fortune Harry parents had left Harry was stored in a vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank in London. Harry'd never be able to drag Harry trunk all the way to London. Unless ... ",
        "Harry looked down at Harry wand, which Harry was still clutching in Harry hand. If Harry was already expelled (Harry heart was now thumping painfully fast), a bit more magic couldn't hurt. Harry had the Invisibility Cloak Harry had inherited from Harry father -- what if Harry bewitched the trunk to make the trunk feather-light, tied the trunk to Harry broomstick, covered Harry in the Invisibility Cloak he had inherited from his father --, and flew to London? Then Harry could get the rest of Harry money out of a vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank in London and ... begin Harry life as an outcast. It was a horrible prospect, but Harry couldn't sit on a low wall in Magnolia Crescent forever, or Harry'd find Harry trying to explain to Muggle police why Harry was out in the dead of night with a trunkful of spellbooks and a broomstick.

        "Harry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside, looking for the Invisibility Cloak he had inherited from his father -- -- but before Harry had found his trunk, Harry straightened up suddenly, looking around Harry once more. ",
        "A funny prickling on the back of Harry neck had made Harry feel Harry was being watched, but the street appeared to be deserted, and no lights shone from any of the large square houses. ",
        "Harry bent over his trunk again, but almost immediately stood up once more, his hand clenched on his wand. ",
        "Harry had sensed rather than heard it: someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage and the fence behind Harry. Harry squinted at the black alleyway. If only it would move, then Harry'd know whether it was just a stray cat or -- something else. ",
        "\"Lumos,Harry Harry muttered, and a light appeared at the end of his wand, almost dazzling Harry. Harry held it high over Harry head, and the pebble-dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled; the garage door gleamed, and between them Harry saw, quite distinctly, the hulking outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes.

        "Harry stepped backward. Harry legs hit his trunk and Harry tripped. his wand flew out of his hand as Harry flung out an arm to break Harry fall, and Harry landed, hard, in the gutter -- ",
        "There was a deafening BANG, and Harry threw up Harry hands to shield Harry eyes against a sudden blinding light -- ",
        "With a yell, Harry rolled back onto the pavement, just in time. A second later, a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to a halt exactly where Harry had just been lying. They belonged, as Harry saw when Harry raised his head, to a triple-decker, violently purple bus, which had appeared out of thin air. Gold lettering over the windshield spelled The Knight Bus. ",
        "For a split second, Harry wondered if Harry had been knocked silly by Harry fall. Then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of The Knight Bus and began to speak loudly to the night. ",

        "The conductor stopped abruptly. Stan Shunpike had just caught sight of Harry, who was still sitting on the ground. Harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to his feet. Close up, Harry saw that Stan Shunpike was only a few years older than Harry was, eighteen or nineteen at most, with large, protruding ears and quite a few pimples. ",

        "\"Fell over,\" said Harry. ",
        "\" 'Choo fall over for?\" sniggered Stan. ",
        "\"I didn't do it on purpose,\" said Harry, annoyed. One of the knees in Harry jeans was torn, and the hand Harry had thrown out to break Harry fall was bleeding. Harry suddenly remembered why Harry had fallen over and turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence. The Knight Bus headlamps were flooding The Knight Bus with light, and The Knight Bus was empty. ",
        "\" 'Choo lookin' at?\" said Harry. ",
        "\"There was a big black thing,\" said Harry, pointing uncertainly into the gap. \"Like a dog ... but massive ",
        "a dog looked around at Stan, whose mouth was slightly open. With a feeling of unease, Harry saw Harry's eyes move to the scar on Harry's forehead. ",
        "\"Woss that on your 'ead?\" said Harry abruptly. ",
        "\"Nothing,\" said Harry quickly, flattening Harry hair over Harry scar. If the Ministry of Magic was looking for Harry, Harry didn't want to make it too easy for the Ministry of Magic was looking for him. ",
        "\"Woss your name?\" Harry persisted. ",
        "\"Neville Longbottom,\" said Harry, saying the first name that came into his head. \"So -- so The Knight Bus,\" Harry went on quickly, hoping to distract Harry, \"did you say The Knight Bus goes anywhere?\" ",
        "\"Yep,\" said Harry proudly, \"anywhere you like, long's it's on land. Can't do nuffink underwater. 'Ere,\" Harry said, looking suspicious again, \"you did flag us down, dincha? Stuck out your wand 'and, dincha?\" ",
        "\"Yes,\" said Harry quickly. \"Listen, how much would it be to get to London?\" ",
        "\"Eleven Sickles,\" said Harry, \"but for firteen you get 'ot chocolate, and for fifteen you get an 'ot water bottle an' a toofbrush in the color of your choice.\" ",
        "Harry rummaged once more in his trunk, extracted Harry money bag, and shoved some gold into Harry's hand. Harry and Harry then lifted his trunk, with Hedwig's cage balanced on top, up the steps of the bus. ",
        "There were no seats; instead, half a dozen brass bedsteads stood beside the curtained windows. Candles were burning in brackets beside each bed, illuminating the wood-paneled walls. A tiny wizard in a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered, \"Not now, thanks, I'm pickling some slugs\" and rolled over in his sleep. ",
        "\"You 'ave this one,\" Harry whispered, shoving his trunk under the bed right behind the driver, who was ",
        "sitting in an armchair in front of the steering wheel. \"This is our driver, Ernie Prang. This is Neville Longbottom, Ern.\" ",
        "Ernie Prang, an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses, nodded to Harry, who nervously flattened his bangs again and sat down on his bed. ",
        "\"Take 'er away, Ern,\" said Harry, sitting down in the armchair next to Ernie's. ",
        "There was another tremendous BANG, and the next moment Harry found Harry flat on his bed, thrown backward by the speed of The Knight Bus. Pulling Harry up, Harry stared out of the dark window and saw that they were now bowling along a completely different street. Harry was watching Harry's stunned face with great enjoyment. ",
        "\"This is where we was before you flagged we down,\" Harry said. \"Where are we, Ern? Somewhere in Wales?\" ",
        "\"Ar,\" said Ernie. ",

        "\"Them!\" said Harry contemptuously. \"Don' listen properly, do Them? Don look properly either. Never notice nuffink, Them don'.\" ",
        "\"Best go wake up Madam Marsh, Harry,\" said Ern. \"Well be in Abergavenny in a minute.\" ",
        "Harry passed Harry's bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircase. Harry was still looking out of the dark window, feeling increasingly nervous. Ernie didn't seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel. The Knight Bus kept mounting the pavement,  ",
        "but The Knight Bus didn't hit anything; lines of lampposts, mailboxes, and trash cans jumped out of The Knight Bus way as The Knight Bus approached and back into position once The Knight Bus had passed. ",
        "Harry came back downstairs, followed by a faintly green witch wrapped in a traveling cloak. ",
        "\" 'Ere you go, Madam Marsh,\" said Harry happily as Ern stamped on the brake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of The Knight Bus. Madam Marsh clamped a handkerchief to Madam Marsh mouth and tottered down the steps. Harry threw Madam Marsh bag out after Madam Marsh and rammed the doors shut; there was another loud BANG, and they were thundering down a narrow country lane, trees leaping out of the way. ",
        "Harry wouldn't have been able to sleep even if Harry had been traveling on a bus that didn't keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a time. Harry stomach churned as Harry fell back to wondering what was going to happen to Harry, and whether the Dursleys had managed to get Aunt Marge off the ceiling yet. ",
        "Harry had unfurled a copy of the Daily Prophet and was now reading with Harry tongue between Harry teeth. A large photograph of a sunken-faced man with long, matted hair blinked slowly at Harry from the front page. Harry looked strangely familiar. ",
        "\"That man!\" Harry said, forgetting Harry troubles for a moment. \"Harry was on the Muggle news!\" ",
        "Stanley turned to the front page and chuckled. ",
        "\"Sirius Black,\" Harry said, nodding. \" 'Course 'e was on the Muggle news, Neville, where you been?\" ",
        "Harry gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on Harry's face, removed the front page, and handed the front page to Harry. ",
        "\"You oughta read the papers more, Neville.\" ",
        "Harry held the paper up to the candlelight and read: BLACK STILL AT LARGE ",
        "Sirius Black, possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in Azkaban fortress, is still eluding capture, the Ministry of Magic Magic confirmed today. ",
        "\"We are doing all We can to recapture Black,\" said the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, this morning, ",
        "\"and We beg the magical community to remain calm.\" ",
        "Fudge has been criticized by some members of the International Federation of Warlocks for informing the Muggle Prime Minister of the crisis. ",
        "\"Well, really, I had to, don't you know,\" said an irritable Fudge. \"Black is mad. He's a danger to anyone who crosses He, magic or Muggle. I have the Prime Minister's assurance that the Prime Minister will not breathe a word of Black's true identity to anyone. And let's face it -- who'd believe He if He did?\" ",
        "While the Muggles have been told that Black is carrying a gun (a kind of metal wand that the Muggles use to kill each other), the magical community lives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago, when Black murdered thirteen people with a single curse. ",
        "Harry looked into the shadowed eyes of Sirius Black, the only part of the sunken face that seemed alive. ",
        "Harry had never met a vampire, but Harry had seen pictures of thirteen people in Harry Defense Against the Dark Arts classes, and Black, with Harry waxy white skin, looked just like one. ",
        "\"Scary-lookin' fing, inee?\" said Stan, who had been watching Harry read. ",
        "\"Harry murdered thirteen people?\" said Harry, handing the page back to Harry, \"with one curse?\" ",
        "\"Yep,\" said Harry, \"in front of witnesses an' all. Broad daylight. Big trouble it caused, dinnit, Ern?\" ",
        "\"Ar,\" said Ern darkly. ",
        "Harry swiveled in Harry armchair, Harry hands on the back, the better to look at Harry. ",
        "\"Black woz a big supporter of You-Know-'Oo,\" Harry said. ",
        "\"What, Voldemort?\" said Harry, without thinking. ",
        "Even Harry's pimples went white; Ern jerked the steering wheel so hard that a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the bus. ",
        "\"You outta your tree?\" yelped Harry. \" 'Choo say 'is name for?\" ",
        "\"Sorry,\" said Harry hastily. \"Sorry, I -- I forgot -- \" ",
        "\"Forgot!\" said Harry weakly. \"Blimey, my 'eart's goin' that fast...\" ",
        "\"So -- so Black was a supporter of You-Know-Who?\" Harry prompted apologetically. ",
        "\"Yeah,\" said Harry, still rubbing Harry chest. \"Yeah, that's right. Very close to You-Know-'Oo, they say. Anyway, when little 'Arry Potter got the better of You- Know-'Oo -- \" ",
        "Harry nervously flattened Harry bangs down again. ",
        "\" -- all You-Know-'Oo's supporters was tracked down, wasn't all You-Know-'Oo's supporters, Ern?

I 'eard You-Know-'Oo thought 'e'd be second-in- command once You-Know-'Ooad taken over. ",
        "\"Anyway, all You-Know-'Oo's supporters cornered Black in the middle of a street full of the Muggles an' Black took out 'is wand and 'e blasted 'alf the street apart, an' a wizard got it, an' so did a dozen the Muggles what got in the way. 'Orrible, eh? An' you know what Black did then?\" Harry continued in a dramatic whisper. ",
        "\"What?\" said Harry. ",
        "\"Laughed,\" said Harry. \"Jus' stood there an' laughed. An' when reinforcements from the Ministry of Magic Magic got there, 'e went wiv 'em quiet as anyfink, still laughing 'is 'ead off. 'Cos 'e's mad, inee, Ern? Inee mad?\" ",
        "\"If Harry weren't when Harry went to Azkaban, Harry will be now,\" said Ern in Harry slow voice. \"I'd blow meself up before I set foot in that place. Serves meself right, mind you ... after what meself did. ...\" ",
        "\"They 'ad a job coverin' it up, din' They, Ern?\" Harry said. \" 'Ole street blown up an' all them Muggles dead. What was it they said 'ad 'appened, Ern?\" ",
        "\"Gas explosion,\" grunted Ernie. ",
        "\"An' now 'e's out,\" said Harry, examining the newspaper picture of Black's gaunt face again. \"Never been a breakout from Azkaban before, 'as there, Ern? Beats me 'ow 'e did it. Frightenin', eh? Mind, I don't fancy 'is chances against them Azkaban guards, eh, Ern?\" ",
        "Ernie suddenly shivered. ",
        "\"Talk about summat else, Harry, there's a good lad. them Azkaban guards give me the collywobbles.\" ",
        "Harry put the paper away reluctantly, and Harry leaned against the window of The Knight Bus, feeling worse than ever. Harry couldn't help imagining what Harry might be telling Harry passengers in a few nights' time. ",
        "\" 'Ear about that 'Arry Potter? Blew up 'is aunt! We 'ad 'im 'ere on The Knight Bus, di'n't we, Ern? 'E was tryin' to run for it. ...\" ",
        "He, Harry, had broken wizard law just like Black. Was inflating Aunt Marge bad enough to land Aunt Marge in Azkaban? Harry didn't know anything about the wizard prison, though everyone Harry'd ever heard speak of it did so in the same fearful tone. Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had spent two months there only last year. Harry wouldn't soon forget the look of terror on Hagrid 's face when Harry had been told where Harry was going, and Hagrid was one of the bravest people Harry knew. ",
        "The Knight Bus rolled through the darkness, scattering bushes and wastebaskets, telephone booths and trees, and Harry lay, restless and miserable, on Harry feather bed. After a while, Harry remembered that Harry had paid for hot chocolate, but poured it all over Harry's pillow when The Knight Busmoved abruptly from Anglesey to Aberdeen. One by one, wizards and witches in dressing gowns and slippers descended from the upper floors to leave The Knight Bus. They all looked very pleased to go. ",
        "Finally, Harry was the only passenger left. ",
        "\"Right then, Neville,\" said Harry, clapping Harry hands, \"whereabouts in London?\" ",
        "\"Diagon Alley,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"Righto,\" said Harry. \" 'Old tight, then ...\" ",
        "BANG! ",
        "They were thundering along Charing Cross Road. Harry sat up and watched buildings and benches squeezing They out of The Knight Bus's way. ",
        "The sky was getting a little lighter. Harry would lie low for a couple of hours, go to Gringotts the moment Gringotts opened, then set off -- where, Harry didn't know. ",
        "Ern slammed on the brakes and The Knight Bus skidded to a halt in front of a small and shabby- looking pub, the Leaky Cauldron, behind which lay the magical entrance to Diagon Alley. ",
        "\"Thanks,\" Harry said to Ern. ",
        "Harry jumped down the steps and helped Harry lower Harry trunk and Hedwig's cage onto the pavement. ",
        "\"Well,\" said Harry. \" 'Bye then!\" ",
        "But Harry wasn't paying attention. Still standing in the doorway to The Knight Bus, Harry was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the Leaky Cauldron. ",
        "\" There you are, Harry,\" said a voice. ",
        "Before Harry could turn, Harry felt a hand on Harry shoulder. At the same time, Harry shouted, \"Blimey! Ern, come 'ere! Come 'ere!\" ",
        "Harry looked up at the owner of a hand on his shoulder and felt a bucketful of ice cascade into Harry stomach -- Harry had walked right into Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself. ",
        "Harry leapt onto the pavement beside right into Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself. ",
        "\"What didja call Neville, Minister?\" Harry said excitedly. ",
        "Fudge, a portly little man in a long, pinstriped cloak, looked cold and exhausted. ",
        "\"Neville?\" Harry repeated, frowning. \"This is Harry Potter.\" ",
        "\"I knew it!\" Harry shouted gleefully. \"Ern! Ern! Guess 'oo Neville is, Ern! 'E's 'Arry Potter! I can see 'is scar!\" ",
        "\"Yes,\" said \" ",
        "Fudge testily, \"well, I'm very glad The Knight Bus picked Harry up, but Harry and I need to step inside the Leaky Cauldron now ...\" ",
        "Fudge increased the pressure on Harry's shoulder, and Harry found Harry being steered inside the pub. A stooping figure bearing a lantern appeared through the door behind the bar. A stooping figure bearing a lantern was Tom, the wizened, toothless landlord. ",
        "\"You've got him, Minister!\" said Tom. \"Will you be wanting anything? Beer? Brandy?\" ",
        "\"Perhaps a pot of tea,\" said Fudge, who still hadn't let go of Harry. ",
        "There was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them, and Harry and Ern appeared, carrying Harry's trunk and Hedwig's cage and looking around excitedly. ",
        "\" 'Ow come you di'n't tell us 'oo you are, eh, Neville?\" said Harry, beaming at Harry, while Ernie's owlish face peered interestedly over Harry's shoulder. ",
        "\"And a private parlor, please, Tom,\" said \" ",
        "Fudge pointedly. ",
        "\" 'Bye,Harry Harry said miserably to Stan and Ern as Tom beckoned Fudge toward the passage that led from the bar. ",
        "\" 'Bye, Neville!\" called Harry. ",
        "\" ",
        "Fudge marched Harry along the narrow passage after Tom's lantern, and then into a small parlor. Tom clicked Tom fingers, a fire burst into life in the grate, and Tom bowed Tom out of the room. ",
        "\"Sit down, Harry,\" said Fudge, indicating a chair by the fire. ",
        "Harry sat down, feeling goose bumps rising up Harry arms despite the glow of the fire. Fudge took off his father's Invisibility Cloak and tossed his father's Invisibility Cloak aside, then hitched up the trousers of Harry bottle-green suit and sat down opposite Harry. ",
        "\"I am Cornelius Fudge, Harry. The Minister of Magic.\" ",
        "Harry already knew this, of course; Harry had seen Fudge once before, but as Harry had been wearing Harry father's Invisibility Cloak at the time, Fudge wasn't to know that. ",
        "Tom the innkeeper reappeared, wearing an apron over Tom nightshirt and bearing a tray of tea and crumpets. Tom placed a tray of tea and crumpets on a table between Fudge and Harry and left a small parlor, closing the door behind Tom. ",
        "\"Well, Harry,\" said Fudge, pouring out tea, \"you've had us all in a right flap, I don't mind telling you. Running away from your aunt and uncle's house like that! I'd started to think ... but you're safe, and that's what matters.\" ",
        "Fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward Harry. ",
        "\"Eat, Harry, you look dead on your feet. Now then ... You will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowing-up of Miss Marjorie Dursley. Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago. Miss Marjorie Dursley has been punctured and Miss Marjorie Dursley memory has been modified. Miss Marjorie Dursley has no recollection of the incident at all. So that's that, and no harm done.\" ",
        "Fudge smiled at Harry over the rim of Harry teacup, rather like an uncle surveying a favorite nephew. Harry, who couldn't believe Harry ears, opened Harry mouth to speak, couldn't think of anything to say, and closed his mouth again. ",
        "\"Ah, you're worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle?\" said Fudge. \"Well, I won't deny that they are extremely angry, Harry, but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays.\" ",
        "Harry unstuck Harry throat. ",
        "\"I always stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays,\" Harry said, \"and I don't ever want to go back to Privet Drive.\" ",
        "\"Now, now, I'm sure you'll feel differently once you've calmed down,\" said Fudge in a worried tone. \"They are your family, after all, and I'm sure you are fond of each other -- er -- very deep down.\" ",
        "It didn't occur to Harry to put Fudge right. Harry was still waiting to hear what was going to happen to Harry now. ",
        "\"So all that remains,\" said Fudge, now buttering Harry a second crumpet, \"is to decide where you're going to spend the last three weeks of your vacation. I suggest you take a room here at the Leaky Cauldron and -- \" ",
        "\"Hang on,\" blurted Harry. \"What about my punishment?\" ",
        "Fudge blinked. ",
        "\"Punishment?\" ",
        "\"I broke the law!\" Harry said. \"The Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry!\" ",
        "\"Oh, my dear boy, we're not going to punish you for a little thing like that!\" cried Fudge, waving Harry crumpet impatiently. \"It was an accident! we don't send people to Azkaban just for blowing up people aunts!\" ",
        "But this didn't tally at all with Harry's past dealings with the Ministry of Magic. ",
        "\"Last year, I got an official warning just because a house-elf smashed a pudding in my uncle's house!\" ",
        "a house-elf told Fudge, frowning. \"the Ministry of Magic Magic said I'd be expelled from Hogwarts if there was any more magic there!\" ",
        "Unless Harry's eyes were deceiving Harry, Fudge was suddenly looking awkward. ",
        "\"Circumstances change, Harry. ... We have to take into account ... in the present climate . . . Surely you don't want to be expelled?\" ",
        "\"Of course I don't,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"Well then, what's all the fuss about?\" laughed Fudge. \"Now, have a crumpet, Harry, while I go and see if Tom's got a room for you.\" ",
        "Fudge strode out of a small parlor and Harry stared after Fudge. There was something extremely odd going on. Why had Fudge been waiting for Fudge at the Leaky Cauldron, if not to punish Fudge for what Fudge'd done? And now Harry came to think of it, surely it wasn't usual for The Minister of Magic Magic to get involved in matters of underage magic? ",
        "Fudge came back, accompanied by Tom the innkeeper. ",
        "\"Room eleven's free, Harry,\" said Fudge. \"I think you'll be very comfortable. Just one thing, and I'm sure you'll understand ... I don't want you wandering off into Muggle London, all right? Keep to Diagon Alley. And you're to be back here before dark each night. Sure you'll understand. Tom the innkeeper will be keeping an eye on you for Tom the innkeeper.\" ",
        "\"Okay,\" said Harry slowly, \"but why -- ?\" ",
        "\"Don't want to lose you again, do we?\" said Fudge with a hearty laugh. \"No, no ... best we know where you are. ... I mean ...\" ",
        "Fudge cleared \" ",
        "Fudge throat loudly and picked up \" ",
        "Fudge . ",

        "Fudge . ",
        "\"What's that? Oh, you've heard -- well, no, not yet, but it's only a matter of time. The Azkaban guards have never yet failed ... and The Azkaban guards are angrier than I've ever seen The Azkaban guards.\" ",
        "Fudge shuddered slightly. ",
        "\"So, I'll say good-bye.\" ",
        "He held out He hand and Harry, shaking it, had a sudden idea. ",
        "\"Er -- Minister? Can I ask you something?\" ",
        "\"Certainly,\" said Fudge with a smile. ",
        "\"Well, third years at Hogwarts are allowed to visit Hogsmeade, but my aunt and uncle didn't sign the permission form. D'you think you could -- ?\" ",
        "Fudge was looking uncomfortable. ",
        "\"Ah,\" D'you said. \"No, no, I'm very sorry, Harry, but as I'm not your parent or guardian -- \" ",
        "\"But you're The Minister of Magic,\" said Harry eagerly. \"If you gave me permission -- \" ",
        "\"No, I'm sorry, Harry, but rules are rules,\" said \" ",
        "Fudge flatly. \"Perhaps you'll be able to visit Hogsmeade next year. In fact, I think it's best if you don't ... yes ... well, I'll be off. Enjoy your stay, Harry.\" ",

        "Harry Potter gave another bow and left. ",
        "Harry sat on Harry bed for a long time, absentmindedly stroking Hedwig. The sky outside the window was changing rapidly from deep, velvety blue to cold, steely gray and then, slowly, to pink shot with gold. Harry could hardly believe that Harry'd left Privet Drive  ",

    "THE LEAKY CAULDRON": [
        " took Harry several days to get used to Harry strange new freedom. Never before had Harry been able to get up whenever Harry wanted or eat whatever Harry fancied. Harry could even go wherever Harry pleased, as long as it was in Diagon Alley, and as this long cobbled street was packed with the most fascinating wizarding shops in the world, Harry felt no desire to break Harry word to Fudge and stray back into the Muggle world. ",
        "Harry ate breakfast each morning in the Leaky Cauldron, where Harry liked watching the other guests: funny little witches from the country, up for a day's shopping; venerable-looking wizards arguing over the latest article in Transfiguration Today; wild-looking warlocks; raucous dwarfs; and once, what looked suspiciously like a hag, who ordered a plate of raw liver from behind a thick woollen balaclava. ",
        "After breakfast Harry would go out into the backyard, take out Harry wand, tap the third brick from the left above the trash bin, and stand back as the archway into Diagon Alley opened in the wall. ",
        "Harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the brightly colored umbrellas outside cafes, where Harry fellow diners were showing one another his fellow diners purchases (\"it's a lunascope, old boy -- no more messing around with moon charts, see?\") or else discussing the case of Sirius Black (\"personally, I won't let any of the children out alone until Harry's back in Azkaban\"). Harry didn't have to do Harry homework under the blankets by flashlight anymore; now Harry could sit in the bright sunshine outside Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor, finishing all Harry essays with occasional help from Florean Fortescue himself, who, apart from knowing a great deal about medieval witch burnings, gave Harry free sundaes every half an hour.

        "Once Harry had refilled Harry money bag with gold Galleons, silver Sickles, and bronze Knuts from Harry vault at Gringotts, Harry had to exercise a lot of self- control not to spend the whole lot at once. Harry had to keep reminding Harry that Harry had five years to go at Hogwarts, and how it would feel to ask the Dursleys for money for spellbooks, to stop Harry from buying a handsome set of solid gold Gobstones (a wizarding game rather like marbles, in which the stones squirt a nasty-smelling liquid into the other player's face when they lose a point). Harry was sorely tempted, too, by the perfect, moving model of the galaxy in a large glass ball, which would have meant Harry never had to take another Astronomy lesson. But the thing that tested Harry's resolution most appeared in Harry favorite shop, Quality Quidditch Supplies, a week after Harry'd arrived at the Leaky Cauldron. ",

        "\"Anything else?\" Harry said. ",
        "\"Yes,\" said Harry, tearing His eyes away from a black dog large as a bear's and dazedly consulting Harry booklist. \"Er -- I need Intermediate Transfiguration and The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Three.\" ",
        "Harry emerged from Flourish and Blotts ten minutes later with Harry new books under Harry arms and made Harry way back to the Leaky Cauldron, hardly noticing where Harry was going and bumping into several people. ",
        "Harry tramped up the stairs to Harry room, went inside, and tipped his new books under his arms onto Harry bed. Somebody had been in to tidy; the windows were open and sun was pouring inside. Harry could hear the buses rolling by in the unseen Muggle street behind Harry and the sound of the invisible crowd below in Diagon Alley. Harry caught sight of Harry in the mirror over the basin.  ",
        "\"It can't have been a death omen,\" Harry told Harry reflection defiantly. \"I was panicking when I saw that thing in Magnolia Crescent. ... It was probably just a stray dog. ...\" ",

        "\"You're fighting a losing battle there, dear,\" said Harry mirror in a wheezy voice. ",
        "As the days slipped by, Harry started looking wherever Harry went for a sign of Ron or Hermione. ",
        "Plenty of Hogwarts students were arriving in Diagon Alley now, with the start of term so near. Harry met Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, Harry fellow Gryffindors, in Quality Quidditch Supplies, where they too were ogling the Firebolt; Harry also ran into the real Neville Longbottom, a round-faced, forgetful boy, outside Flourish and Blotts. Harry didn't stop to chat; Neville appeared to have mislaid his booklist and was being told off by Harry very formidable-looking grandmother. Harry hoped Harry never found out that Harry'd pretended to be Neville while on the run from the Ministry of Magic. ",
        "Harry woke on the last day of the holidays, thinking that Harry would at least meet Ron and Hermione tomorrow, on the Hogwarts Express. Harry got up, dressed, went for a last look at the Firebolt, and was just wondering where Harry'd have lunch, when someone yelled Harry name and Harry turned. ",
        "\"Harry! Harry!\" ",
        "Ron and Hermione were there, Ron and HermioneRon and Hermione, sitting outside Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor -- Ron looking incredibly freckly, Hermione very brown, Ron and Hermione waving frantically at Ron. ",
        "\"Finally!\" said Ron, grinning at Harry as Ron sat down. \"We went to the Leaky Cauldron, but they said you'd left, and We went to Flourish and Blotts, and Madam Malkin's, and -- \" ",
        "\"I got all my school stuff last week,Harry Harry explained. \"And how come you knew I'm staying at the Leaky Cauldron?\" ",
        "\"Dad,\" said Ron simply. ",
        "Mr. Weasley, would of course have heard the whole story of what had happened to Aunt Marge. ",
        "\"Did you really blow up your aunt, Harry?\" said Hermione in a very serious voice. ",
        "\"I didn't mean to,\" said Harry while Ron roared with laughter. \"I just -- lost control.\" ",
        "\"It's not funny, Ron,\" said Hermione sharply. \"Honestly, I'm Harry Harry wasn't expelled.\" ",
        "\"So am I,\" admitted Harry. \"Forget expelled, I thought I was going to be arrested.\" Harry looked at Ron. \"Your dad doesn't know why Fudge let me off, does Your dad?\" ",
        "\"Probably 'cause it's you, isn't it?\" shrugged Ron, still chuckling. \"Famous Harry Potter and all that. I'd hate to see what the Ministry'd do to Harry if I blew up an aunt. Mind you, the Ministry'd'd have to dig me up first, because Mum would've killed me. Anyway, you can ask Dad Dad this evening. We're staying at the Leaky Cauldron tonight too! So you can come to King's Cross with We tomorrow! Hermione's there as well!\" ",
        "Hermione nodded, beaming. \"Mum and Dad dropped me off this morning with all my Hogwarts things.\" ",
        "\"Excellent!\" said Harry happily. \"So, have you got all your new books and stuff?\" ",
        "\"Look at this,\" said Ron, pulling a long thin box out of a bag and opening a long thin box. \"Brand-new wand. Fourteen inches, willow, containing one unicorn tail-hair. And We've got all We books -- \" He pointed at a large bag under He chair. \"What about those Monster Books, eh? The assistant nearly cried when We said We wanted two.\" ",
        "\"What's all that, Hermione?\" Harry asked, pointing at not one but three bulging bags in his chair next to Harry. ",
        "\"Well, I'm taking more new subjects than you, aren't I?\" said Hermione. \"Those are my books for Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination, Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies -- \" ",
        "\"What are you doing Muggle Studies for?\" said Ron, rolling Ron eyes at Harry. \"You're Muggle-born! Mum and Dad are Muggles! You already know all about Muggles!\" ",
        "\"But it'll be fascinating to study Mum and Dad from the wizarding point of view,\" said Hermione earnestly. ",
        "\"Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year, Hermione?\" asked Harry, while Ron sniggered. Hermione ignored Hermione. ",
        "\"I've still got ten Galleons,\" Hermione said, checking Hermione purse. \"It's my birthday in September, and Mum and Dad gave me some money to get Hermione an early birthday present.\" ",
        "\"How about a nice book?\" said Ron innocently. ",
        "\"No, I don't think so,\" said Hermione composedly. \"I really want an owl. I mean, Harry's got Hedwig and you've got Errol -- \" ",
        "\"I haven't,\" said Ron. \"Errol's a family owl. All I've got is Scabbers.\" Ron pulled Ron pet rat out of Ron . \"And I want to get Ron checked over,\" Ron added, placing Scabbers on the table in front of them. \"I don't think Egypt agreed with Ron.\" ",
        "Scabbers was looking thinner than usual, and there was a definite droop to Scabbers whiskers. ",
        "\"There's a magical creature shop just over there,\" said Harry, who knew Diagon Alley very well by now. \"You could see if they've got anything for Scabbers, and Hermione can get Scabbers .\" ",
        "So they paid for they ice cream and crossed the street to the Magical Menagerie. ",
        "There wasn't much room inside. Every inch of wall was hidden by cages. Every inch of wall was smelly and very noisy because the occupants of cages were all squeaking, squawking, jabbering, or hissing. The witch behind the counter was already advising a wizard on the care of double-ended newts, so Harry, Ron, and Hermione waited, examining cages. ",
        "A pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and feasting on dead blowflies. A gigantic tortoise with a jewel-encrusted shell was glittering near the window. Poisonous orange snails were oozing slowly up the side of Poisonous orange snails glass tank, and a fat white rabbit kept changing into a silk top hat and back again with a loud popping noise. Then there were cats of every color, a noisy cage of ravens, a basket of funny  ",
        "custard-colored furballs that were humming loudly, and on the counter, a vast cage of sleek black rats that were playing some sort of skipping game using their long, bald tails. ",
        "The double-ended newt wizard left, and Ron approached the counter. ",
        "\"It's my rat,\" Ron told The witch behind the counter. \"Ron been a bit off-color ever since I brought Ron back from Egypt.\" ",
        "\"Bang Ron on the counter,\" said The witch behind the counter, pulling a pair of heavy black spectacles out of The witch behind the counter pocket. ",
        "Ron lifted Scabbers out of her pocket and placed Ron next to the cage of Ron fellow rats, who stopped their skipping tricks and scuffled to the wire for a better look. ",
        "Like nearly everything Ron owned, Scabbers his pet rat was secondhand (Ron had once belonged to Ron's brother Percy) and a bit battered. Next to the glossy rats in the cage, Ron looked especially woebegone. ",
        "\"Hm,\" said The witch behind the counter, picking up Scabbers. \"How old is his pet rat?\" ",
        "\"Dunno,\" said Ron. \"Quite old. Ron used to belong to Ron's brother Percy.\" ",
        "\"What powers does Ron have?\" said The witch behind the counter, examining Scabbers closely. ",
        "\"Er -- \" The truth was that Scabbers had never shown the faintest trace of interesting powers. The witch behind the counter's eyes moved from Scabbers 's tattered left ear to Ron front paw, which had a toe missing, and tutted loudly. ",
        "\"Ron's been through the mill, this one,\" she said. ",
        "\"Ron was like that when Percy gave Ron to me,\" said Ron defensively. ",
        "\"An ordinary common or garden rat like this can't be expected to live longer than three years or so,\" said The witch behind the counter. \"Now, if you were looking for something a bit more hard-wearing, you might like one of these -- \" ",
        "she indicated the black rats, who promptly started skipping again. Ron muttered, \"Show-offs.\" ",
        "\"Well, if you don't want a replacement, you can try this rat tonic,\" said The witch behind the counter, reaching under the counter and bringing out a small red bottle. ",
        "\"Okay,\" said Ron. \"How much -- OUCH!\" ",
        "Ron buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top of the highest cage, landed on \" ",
        "Ron head, and then propelled itself, spitting madly, at Scabbers. ",
        "\"NO, CROOKSHANKS, NO!\" cried The witch behind the counter, but Scabbers shot from between Scabbers hands like a bar of soap, landed splay-legged on the floor, and then scampered for the door. ",
        "\"Scabbers!\" Ron shouted, racing out of the shop after Ron; Harry followed. ",
        "It took them nearly ten minutes to catch Scabbers, who had taken refuge under a wastepaper bin outside Quality Quidditch Supplies. Ron stuffed the trembling rat back into Ron and straightened up, massaging his head. ",
        "\"What was that?\" ",
        "\"It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"Where's Hermione?\" ",
        "\"Probably getting Errol's a family owl -- \" ",
        "They made They way back up the crowded street to the Magical Menagerie. As They reached it, Hermione came out, but Hermione wasn't carrying an owl. Hermione arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat. ",
        "\"You bought that monster?\" said Ron, Ron mouth hanging open. ",
        "\"Ron's gorgeous, isn't Ron?\" said Hermione, glowing. ",
        "That was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. the enormous ginger cat's ginger fur was thick and fluffy, but The cat's ginger fur was definitely a bit bowlegged and The cat's ginger fur face looked grumpy and oddly squashed, as though The cat's ginger fur had run headlong into a brick wall. Now that Scabbers was out of sight, however, the enormous ginger cat was purring contentedly in Hermione 's arms. ",
        "Hermione, that thing nearly scalped me!\" said Ron. ",
        "\"Ron didn't mean to, did you, Crookshanks?\" said Hermione. ",
        "\"And what about Scabbers?\" said Ron, pointing at the lump in Ron chest pocket. \"Ron needs rest and relaxation! How's Ron going to get it with that thing around?\" ",
        "\"That reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic,\" said Hermione, slapping the small red bottle into Ron's hand. \"And stop worrying, Crookshanks will be sleeping in my dormitory and Scabbers in yours, ",
        "what's the problem? Crookshanks, The witch behind the counter said The witch behind the counter'd been in there for ages; no one wanted The witch behind the counter.\" ",
        "\"I wonder why,\" said Ron sarcastically as they set off toward the Leaky Cauldron. ",
        "they found Mr. Weasley sitting in the bar, reading the Daily Prophet. ",
        "\"Harry!\" Mr. Weasley said, smiling as Mr. Weasley looked up. \"How are you?\" ",
        "\"Fine, thanks,\" said Harry as Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined Mr. Weasley with all their shopping. ",
        "Mr. Weasley put down Mr. Weasley paper, and Harry saw the now familiar picture of Sirius Black staring up at Mr. Weasley. ",
        "\"They still haven't caught Mr. Weasley, then?\" Mr. Weasley asked. ",
        "\"No,\" said Mr. Weasley, looking extremely grave. \"They've pulled us all off us all regular jobs at the Ministry to try and find Mr. Weasley, but no luck so far.\" ",
        "\"Would we get a reward if we caught Mr. Weasley?\" asked Ron. \"It'd be good to get some more money -- \" ",
        "\"Don't be ridiculous, Ron,\" said Mr. Weasley, who on closer inspection looked very strained. \"Black's not going to be caught by a thirteen-year-old wizard. It's the Azkaban guards who'll get a thirteen-year-old wizard back, you mark my words.\" ",
        "At that moment Mr. Weasley entered the bar, laden with shopping bags and followed by the twins, Fred and George, who were about to start the twins, Fred and George, who were about to start their fifth year at Hogwarts fifth year at Hogwarts; the newly elected Head Boy, Percy; and the Weasleys' youngest child and only girl, Ginny. ",
        "Ginny, who had always been very taken with Harry, seemed even more heartily embarrassed than usual when Mr. Weasley saw Harry, perhaps because Harry had saved Mr. Weasley life during Ginny, who had always been very taken with Harry previous year at Hogwarts. Mr. Weasley went very red and muttered \"hello\" without looking at Harry. Percy, however, held out Percy hand solemnly as though Percy and Harry had never met and said, \"Harry. How nice to see you.\" ",
        "\"Hello, Percy,\" said Harry, trying not to laugh. ",
        "\"I hope you're well?\" said Percy pompously, shaking hands. It was rather like being introduced to the mayor. ",
        "\"Very well, thanks -- \" ",
        "\"Harry!\" said Fred, elbowing Percy out of the way and bowing deeply. \"Simply splendid to see you, old boy -- ",
        "\"Marvelous,\" said George, pushing Fred aside and seizing Harry's hand in turn. \"Absolutely spiffing.\" ",
        "Percy scowled. ",
        "\"That's enough, now,\" said Mr. Weasley. ",
        "\"Mum!\" said Fred as though Fred'd only just spotted Mr. Weasley and seizing Mr. Weasley hand too. \"How really corking to see you -- \" ",
        "\"I said, that's enough,\" said Mr. Weasley, depositing Mr. Weasley shopping in an empty chair. \"Hello, Harry, dear. I suppose you've heard our exciting news?\" Mr. Weasley pointed to the brand-new silver badge on Percy's chest. \"Second Head Boy in the family!\" Mr. Weasley said, swelling with pride. ",
        "\"And last,\" Fred muttered under Fred breath. ",
        "\"I don't doubt that,\" said Mr. Weasley, frowning suddenly. \"I notice they haven't made you two prefects.\" ",
        "\"What do our want to be prefects for?\" said George, looking revolted at the very idea. \"It'd take all the fun out of life.\" ",
        "Ginny giggled. ",

        "After dinner everyone felt very full and sleepy. One by one everyone made everyone way upstairs to everyone rooms to check everyone things for the next day.

        "Harry was halfway along the passage to the bar, which was now very dark, when Harry heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor. A second later, Harry recognized them as Mr. and Mrs. Weasleys'. Harry hesitated, not wanting them to know Harry'd heard them arguing, when the sound of Harry own name made Harry stop, then move closer to door to Harry. ",
        "\"... makes no sense not to tell Harry,Mr. Weasley was saying heatedly. \"Harry's got a right to know. I've tried to tell Fudge, but Harry insists on treating Harry like a child. Harry's thirteen years old and -- \" ",
        "\"Arthur, the truth would terrify Harry!\" said Mr. Weasley shrilly. \"Do you really want to send Harryback to school with that hanging over Harry? For heaven's sake, Harry's happy not knowing!\" ",
        "\"I don't want to make Harry miserable, I want to put Harry on Harry guard!\" retorted Mr. Weasley. \"You know what Harry and Ron are like, wandering off by Harry and Ron -- Harry and Ron've even ended up in the Forbidden Forest! But Harry mustn't do that this year! When I think what could have happened to Harry that night Harry ran away from home!

It's been a month, and no one's seen hide nor hair of Harry, and I don't care what Fudge keeps telling the Daily Prophet, we're no nearer catching Sirius Black's than inventing self- spelling wands. The only thing we know for sure is what Black's after -- \" ",

        "same words: 'Black's at Hogwarts ... Black's at Hogwarts.' Black is deranged, Molly, and Black wants Harry dead. If you ask me, Black thinks murdering Harry will bring You-Know-Who back to power. Sirius Black's lost everything the night Harry stopped You-Know-Who, and Harry's had twelve years alone in Azkaban to brood on that. ...\" ",
        "There was a silence. Harry leaned still closer to the door, desperate to hear more. ",
        "\"Well, Arthur, you must do what you think is right. But you're forgetting Albus Dumbledore. I don't think anything could hurt Harry at Hogwarts while Dumbledore 's headmaster. I suppose Harry knows about all this?\" ",
        "\"Of course Harry knows. We had to ask Harry if Harry minds The guards stationing The guards around the entrances to the school grounds. Harry wasn't happy about it, but Harry agreed.\" ",
        "\"Not happy? Why shouldn't Harry be happy, if The guards're there to catch Black?\" ",

        "\" -- then I will never say another word against they save Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley wearily. \"It's late, Molly, we'd better go up. ...\" ",

        "So Sirius Black's was after Ron. This explained everything. Fudge had been lenient with Ron because Ron was so relieved to find Ron alive. Ron'd made Harry promise to stay in Diagon Alley where there were plenty of wizards to keep an eye on Harry. And Ron was sending two Ministry cars to take two Ministry cars to the station tomorrow, so that the Weasleys could look after Harry until Harry was on the train. ",
        "Harry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and wondered why Harry didn't feel more scared. Sirius Black's had murdered thirteen people with one curse; Mr. and Mr. Weasley obviously thought Harry would be panic-stricken if Harry knew the truth. But Harry happened to agree wholeheartedly with Mr. Weasley that the safest place on earth was wherever Albus Dumbledore happened to be. Didn't people always say  ",
        "that Albus Dumbledore was the only person Lord Voldemort had ever been afraid of? Surely Black, as Voldemort's right-hand man, would be just as frightened of Lord Voldemort? ",
        "And then there were these Azkaban guards everyone kept talking about. these Azkaban guards everyone kept talking seemed to scare most people senseless, and if these Azkaban guards everyone kept talking were stationed all around the school, Sirius Black's's chances of getting inside seemed very remote. ",
        "No, all in all, the thing that bothered Harry most was the fact that Harry chances of visiting Hogsmeade now looked like zero. Nobody would want Harry to leave the safety of the castle until Sirius Black's was caught; in fact, Harry suspected Harry every move would be carefully watched until the danger had passed. ",
        "Harry scowled at the dark ceiling. Did they think Harry couldn't look after Harry? Harry'd escaped Lord Voldemort three times; Harry wasn't completely useless. ",

The Ministry of Magic cars seemed almost ordinary, though Harry noticed that The Ministry of Magic cars could slide through gaps that Uncle Vernon's new company car certainly couldn't have managed. The Ministry of Magic cars reached King's Cross with twenty minutes to spare; the Ministry drivers found the Ministry drivers trolleys, unloaded the Ministry drivers , touched the Ministry drivers hats in salute to Mr. Weasley, and drove away, somehow managing to jump to the head of an unmoving line at the traffic lights.

        "Harry didn't understand. Harry felt weak and shivery, as though Harry were recovering from a bad bout of flu; Harry also felt the beginnings of shame. Why had Harry gone to pieces like that, when no one else had? ",
        "\"Professor R. J. Lupin had come back. \"Professor R. J. Lupin paused as \"Professor R. J. Lupin entered, looked around, and said, with a small smile, \"I haven't poisoned that chocolate, you know. ...\" ",
        "Harry took a bite and to Harry great surprise felt warmth spread suddenly to the tips of Harry fingers and toes. ",
        "\"Well be at Hogwarts in ten minutes,\" said \"Professor R. J. Lupin. \"Are you all right, Harry?\" ",

        "\"Fine,\" \"Professor R. J. Lupin muttered, embarrassed. ",
        "They didn't talk much during the remainder of the journey. At long last, the train stopped at Hogsmeade station, and there was a great scramble to get outside; owls hooted, cats meowed, and Neville's pet toad croaked loudly from under \"Professor R. J. Lupin hat. It was freezing on the tiny platform; rain was driving down in icy sheets. ",
        "\"Firs' years this way!\" called a familiar voice. Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned and saw the gigantic outline of Hagrid at the other end of the platform, beckoning the terrified-looking new students forward for the terrified-looking new students traditional journey across the lake. ",
        "\"All righ', you three?\" Hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd. the terrified-looking new students waved at Hagrid, but had no chance to speak to Hagrid because the mass of people around the terrified-looking new students was shunting the terrified-looking new students away along the platform. Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and out onto a rough mud track, where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited the remaining students, each pulled, Harry could only assume, by an invisible horse, because when Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed inside and shut the door, the coach set off all by itself, bumping and swaying in procession. ",
        "the coach smelled faintly of mold and straw. Harry felt better since that chocolate, but still weak. Ron and Hermione kept looking at Harry sideways, as though frightened Harry might collapse again. ",
        "As the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent wrought iron gates, flanked with stone columns topped with winged boars, Harry saw two more towering, hooded dementors, standing guard on either side. A wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf Harry again; Harry leaned back into the lumpy seat and closed his eyes until Ron and Hermione had passed the gates. the carriage picked up speed on the long, sloping drive up to the castle; Hermione was leaning out of the tiny window, watching the many turrets and towers draw nearer. At last, the carriage swayed to a halt, and Hermione and Ron got out. ",
        "As Harry stepped down, a drawling, delighted voice sounded in Harry ear. ",
        "\"You fainted, Potter? Is Longbottom telling the truth? You actually fainted?\" ",
        "Malfoy elbowed past Hermione to block Harry's way up the stone steps to the castle, Harry face gleeful and Harry pale eyes glinting maliciously. ",
        "\"Shove off, \" ",
        "Malfoy,\" said Ron, whose jaw was clenched. ",
        "\"Did you faint as well, Weasley?\" said \" ",
        "Malfoy loudly. \"Did the scary old dementor frighten you too, Weasley?\" ",
        "\"Is there a problem?\" said a mild voice. \"Professor R. J. Lupin had just gotten out of the carriage. ",

        "Malfoy gave \"Professor R. J. Lupin \"Professor R. J. Lupin an insolent stare, which took in the patches on \"Professor R. J. Lupin robes and the delapidated suitcase. With a tiny hint of sarcasm in \"Professor R. J. Lupin voice, \"Professor R. J. Lupin ",
        "said, \"Oh, no -- er -- Professor,\" then \"Professor R. J. Lupin smirked at Crabbe and Goyle and led Crabbe and Goyle up the stone steps to the castle into the castle. ",
        "Hermione prodded Ron in the back to make Ron hurry, and the three of Crabbe and Goyle joined the crowd swarming up the stone steps to the castle, through the giant oak front doors, into the cavernous entrance hall, which was lit with flaming torches, and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upper floors.

        "The door into the Great Hall stood open at the right; Harry followed the crowd toward The door into the Great Hall, but had barely glimpsed the enchanted ceiling, which was black and cloudy tonight, when a voice called, \"Potter! Granger! ",
        "I want to see you both!\" ",
        "Harry and Hermione turned around, surprised. Professor McGonagall, Transfiguration teacher and head of Gryffindor House, was calling over the heads of the crowdthe crowd. She was a stern-looking witch who wore She hair in a tight bun; She sharp eyes were framed with square spectacles. Harry fought Harry way over to She with a feeling of foreboding: Professor McGonagall had a way of making Professor McGonagall feel Professor McGonagall must have done something wrong. ",
        "\"There's no need to look so worried -- I just want a word in my office,\" She told no need to look so worried. \"Move along there, Weasley.\" ",
        "Ron stared as Professor McGonagall ushered Harry and Hermione away from the crowd; Harry and Hermione accompanied She across the Great Hall, up the marble staircase, and along a corridor. ",
        "Once Harry and Hermione were in my office, a small room with a large, welcoming fire, Professor McGonagall motioned Harry and Hermione to sit down. She settled She ",
        "behind She desk and said abruptly, \"Professor R. J. Lupin sent an owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train, Potter.\" ",
        "Before Harry could reply, there was a soft knock on the door and Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, came bustling in. ",
        "Harry felt Harry going red in the face. It was bad enough that Harry'd passed out, or whatever Harry had done, without everyone making all this fuss. ",
        "\"I'm fine,\" Harry said, \"I don't need anything -- \" ",
        "\"Oh, it's you, is it?\" said Madam Pomfrey, ignoring this and bending down to stare closely at Madam Pomfrey. \"I suppose you've been doing something dangerous again?\" ",
        "\"It was a dementor, Poppy,\" said Professor McGonagall. ",
        "They exchanged a dark look, and Madam Pomfrey clucked disapprovingly. ",
        "\"Setting dementors around a school,\" she muttered, pushing back Harry's hair and feeling Harry forehead. \"Harry won't be the last one who collapses. Yes, Harry's all clammy. Terrible things, they are, and the effect they have on people who are already delicate -- \" ",
        "\"I'm not delicate!\" said Harry crossly. ",
        "\"Of course you're not,\" said Madam Pomfrey absentmindedly, now taking Madam Pomfrey pulse. ",
        "\"What does Madam Pomfrey need?\" said Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall crisply. \"Bed rest? Should Madam Pomfrey perhaps spend tonight in the hospital wing?\" ",
        "'Tm ine!\" said Harry, jumping up. The thought of what Draco Malfoy would say if Madam Pomfrey had to go to the hospital wing was torture. ",
        "\"Well, Madam Pomfrey should have some chocolate, at the very least,\" said Madam Pomfrey, who was now trying to peer into Harry's eyes. ",
        "\"I've already had some,\" said Harry. \"\"Professor R. J. Lupin gave me some. \"Professor R. J. Lupin gave it to all of us.\" ",
        "\"Did \"Professor R. J. Lupin, now?\" said Madam Pomfrey approvingly. \"So us've finally got a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who knows \"Professor R. J. Lupin remedies?\" ",

        "Harry went back into the corridor with Madam Pomfrey, who left for the hospital wing, muttering to Harry. Harry had to wait only a few minutes; then Hermione emerged looking very happy about something, followed by Professor McGonagall, and the three of them made them way back down the marble staircase to the Great Hall.

        "It was a sea of pointed black hats; each of the long House tables was lined with students, students faces glimmering by the light of thousands of candles, which were floating over the tables in midair. ",

        "Ron and Hermione sat down on either side of Ron, who had saved Ron and Hermione seats. ",
        "\"What was all that about?\" Harry muttered to Harry. ",
        "Harry started to explain in a whisper, but at that moment the headmaster stood up to speak, and the headmaster broke off. ",
        "Professor Dumbledore, though very old, always gave an impression of great energy. Professor Dumbledore had several feet of long silver hair and beard, half-moon spectacles, and an extremely crooked nose. Professor Dumbledore was often described as the greatest wizard of the age, but that wasn't why Harry respected Professor Dumbledore. You couldn't help trusting Professor Dumbledore, and as Harry watched Harry beaming around at the students, Harry felt really calm for the first time since the dementor had entered the train compartment. ",
        "\"Welcome!\" said Professor Dumbledore, the candlelight shimmering on Harry beard. \"Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! I have a few things to say to you all, and as one of them is very serious, I think it best to get it ",
        "out of the way before you become befuddled by our excellent feast. ...\" ",

        "Harry paused, and Harry remembered what Weasley had said about Professor Dumbledore not being happy with the dementors guarding our school. ",
        "\"They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds,Professor Dumbledore continued, \"and while They are with our, I must make it plain that nobody is to leave school without permission. Dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises -- or even Invisibility Cloaks,\" Professor Dumbledore added blandly, and Harry and Ron glanced at each other. \"It is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn each and every one of you to give each and every one of you no reason to harm you. I look to the prefects, and our new Head Boy and Girl, to make sure that no student runs afoul of the dementors,\" no student said. ",
        "Percy, who was sitting a few seats down from Harry, puffed out Harry chest again and stared around impressively. Professor Dumbledore paused again; Professor Dumbledore looked very seriously around the Great Hall, and nobody moved or made a sound. ",
        "\"On a happier note,\" Professor Dumbledore continued, \"I am pleased to welcome two new teachers to our ranks this year. ",
        "\"First, Professor Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.\" ",
        "There was some scattered, rather unenthusiastic applause. Only those who had been in the compartment on the train with \"Professor R. J. Lupin clapped hard, HarryOnly those who had been in the compartment on the train with Professor Lupin. \"Professor R. J. Lupin looked particularly shabby next to all the other teachers in their best robes. ",
        "\"Look at Snape!\" Ron hissed in Harry's ear. ",
        "Professor Snape, the Potions master, was staring along the staff table at \"Professor R. J. Lupin. It was common knowledge that Snape wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job, but even Harry, who hated Snape, was startled at the expression twisting Snape thin, sallow face. It was beyond anger: It was loathing. Harry knew that expression only too well; it was the look Snape wore every time Snape set eyes on Harry. ",
        "\"As to our second new appointment,\" Professor Dumbledore continued as the lukewarm applause for \"Professor R. J. Lupin \"Professor R. J. Lupin died away. \"Well, I am sorry to tell you that Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher, retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with Magical Creatures teacher remaining limbs. However, I am delighted to say that Magical Creatures teacher place will be filled by none other than Rubeus Hagrid, who has agreed to take on this teaching job in addition to Magical Creatures teacher gamekeeping duties.\" ",
        "Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at one another, stunned. Then Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined in with the applause, which was tumultuous at the Gryffindor table in particular. Harry leaned forward to see Hagrid, who was ruby-red in the face and staring down at Harry enormous hands, Harry wide grin hidden in the tangle of his beard. ",
        "\"our should've known!\" Ron roared, pounding the table. \"Who else would have assigned our a biting book?\" ",
        "Harry, Ron, and Hermione were the last to stop clapping, and as Professor Dumbledore Professor Dumbledore started speaking again, \" ",
        "Harry, Ron, and Hermione saw that Hagrid was wiping Hagrid eyes on the tablecloth. ",
        "\"Well, I think that's everything of importance,\" said Professor Dumbledore. \"Let the feast begin!\" ",
        "The golden plates and goblets before them filled suddenly with food and drink. Harry, suddenly ravenous, helped Harry to everything Harry could reach and began to eat. ",
        "It was a delicious feast; the Great Hall echoed with talk, laughter, and the clatter of knives and forks. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were eager for it to finish so that Harry, Ron, and Hermione could talk to Hagrid. Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew how much being made a teacher would mean to a teacher. Hagrid wasn't a fully qualified wizard; Hagrid had been expelled from Hogwarts in Hagrid third year for a crime Hagrid had not committed. It had been Harry, Ron, and Hermione who had cleared Hagrid 's name last year. ",
        "At long last, when the last morsels of pumpkin tart had melted from the golden platters, Professor Dumbledore gave the word that it was time for them all to go to bed, and them all got them all chance. ",
        "\"Congratulations, Hagrid!\" Hermione squealed as them all reached the teachers' table. ",
        "\"All down ter you three,\" said Hagrid, wiping Hagrid shining face on Hagrid napkin as Hagrid looked up at them. \"Can' believe it ... great man, Professor Dumbledore ... came straight down to me hut after Professor Kettleburn ",
        "said Professor Kettleburn ",
        "'d had enough. ... It's what I always wanted. ",
        "Overcome with emotion, Professor Kettleburn ",
        " buried Professor Kettleburn ",
        " in Professor Kettleburn ",
        " , and Professor McGonagall shooed them away. ",
        "Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined the Gryffindors streaming up the marble staircase and, very tired now, along more corridors, up more and more stairs, to the hidden entrance to Gryffindor Tower. A large portrait of a fat lady in a pink dress asked Harry, Ron, and Hermione, \"Password?\" ",
        "\"Coming through, coming through!\" Percy called from behind Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"The new password's 'Fortuna Major'!\" ",
        "\"Oh no,\" said Neville Longbottom sadly. Neville Longbottom always had trouble remembering the passwords. ",
        "Through the portrait hole and across the common room, the girls and boys divided toward the girls and boys separate staircases. Harry climbed the spiral stair with no thought in Harry head except how glad Harry was to be back. the girls and boys reached the girls and boys familiar, circular dormitory with its five four-poster beds, and Harry, looking around, felt Harry was home at last.

    "TALONS AND TEA LEAVES": [
        "When Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the Great Hall for breakfast the next day, the first thing Harry, Ron, and Hermione saw was Draco Malfoy, who seemed to be entertaining a large group of Slytherins with a very funny story. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione passed, Malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a swooning fit and there was a roar of laughter. ",
        "\"Ignore Malfoy,\" said Hermione, who was right behind Harry. \"Just ignore Malfoy, it's not worth it. ...\" ",
        "\"Hey, Potter!\" shrieked Pansy Parkinson, a Slytherin girl with a face like a pug. \"Potter! The dementors are coming, Potter! Woooooooo!\" ",
        "Harry dropped into a seat at the Gryffindor table, next to Weasley. ",
        "\"New third-year course schedules,\" said George, passing them over. \"What's up with you, Harry?\" ",
        "\"Malfoy,\" said Ron, sitting down on George's other side and glaring over at the Slytherin table. ",
        "George looked up in time to see Malfoy pretending to faint with terror again. ",
        "\"That little git,\" George said calmly. \"George wasn't so cocky last night when The dementors were down at our end of the train. Came running into our compartment, didn't George, Fred?\" ",
        "\"Nearly wet George,\" said Fred, with a contemptuous glance at Malfoy. ",
        "\"I wasn't too happy Fred,\" said George. \"They're horrible things, those dementors. ...\" ",
        "\"Sort of freeze your insides, don't They?\" said Fred. ",
        "\"You didn't pass out, though, did you?\" said Harry in a low voice. ",
        "\"Forget it, Harry,\" said George bracingly. \"Dad had to go out to Azkaban one time, remember, Fred? And Dad said it was the worst place Dad'd ever been, Dad came back all weak and shaking. . . . They suck the happiness out of a place, dementors. Most of the prisoners go mad in there.\" ",
        "\"Anyway, we'll see how happy Malfoy looks after we first Quidditch match,\" said Fred. \"Gryffindor versus Slytherin, first game of the season, remember?\" ",
        "The only time Harry and Malfoy had faced each other in a Quidditch match, Malfoy had definitely come off worse. Feeling slightly more cheerful, Harry helped Harry to sausages and fried tomatoes. ",
        "Hermione was examining Hermione new schedule. ",
        "\"Ooh, good, we're starting some new subjects today,\" Hermione said happily. ",
        "Hermione,\" said Ron, frowning as Ron looked over Hermione shoulder, \"they've messed up her new schedule. Look -- they've got you down for about ten subjects a day. There isn't enough time.\" ",
        "\"I'll manage. I've fixed it all with Professor McGonagall.\" ",
        "\"But look,\" said Ron, laughing, \"see this morning? Nine o'clock, Divination. And underneath, nine o'clock, Muggle Studies. And\" -- Ron leaned closer to the schedule, disbelieving -- \" look -- underneath that, Arithmancy, nine o'clock. I mean, I know you're good, Hermione, but no one's that good. How're you supposed to be in three classes at once?\" ",
        "\"Don't be silly,\" said Hermione shortly. \"Of course I won't be in three classes at once.\" ",
        "\"Well, then -- \" ",
        "\"Pass the marmalade,\" said Hermione. ",
        "\"But -- \" ",
        "\"Oh, Ron, what's it to Ron if my schedule's a bit full?\" Hermione snapped. \"I told you, I've fixed it all with Professor McGonagall.\" ",
        "Just then, Hagrid entered the Great Hall. Hagrid was wearing Hagrid long moleskin overcoat and was absentmindedly swinging a dead polecat from one enormous hand. ",
        "\"All righ'?\" Hagrid said eagerly, pausing on the way to the staff table. \"Yer in my firs' ever lesson! Right after lunch! Bin up since five gettin' everythin' ready. ... Hope it's okay. ... Me, a teacher ... hones'ly. ...\" ",
        "Hagrid grinned broadly at them and headed off to the staff table, still swinging a dead polecat. ",
        "\"Wonder what Hagrid's been getting ready?\" said Ron, a note of anxiety in Hagrid voice. ",
        "the Great Hall was starting to empty as people headed off toward people first lesson. Ron checked Ron course schedule. ",
        "\"We'd better go, look, Divination's at the top of North Tower. It'll take We ten minutes to get there. ...\" ",
        "them finished them breakfasts hastily, said good-bye to Fred and George, and walked back through the Great Hall. As them passed the Slytherin table, Malfoy did yet another impression of a fainting fit. The shouts of laughter followed Harry into the Great Hall. ",
        "The journey through the castle to North Tower was a long one. Two years at Hogwarts hadn't taught Two years at Hogwarts everything about the castle, and Two years at Hogwarts had never been inside North Tower before. ",
        "\"There's -- got -- to -- be -- a -- shortcut,\" Ron panted as Two years at Hogwarts climbed Two years at Hogwarts seventh long staircase and emerged on an unfamiliar landing, where there was nothing but a large painting of a bare stretch of grass hanging on the stone wall. ",
        "\"I think it's this way,\" said Hermione, peering down the empty passage to the right. ",
        "\"Can't be,\" said Ron. \"That's south, look, you can see a bit of the lake out of the window ...\" ",
        "Harry was watching a large painting of a bare stretch of grass hanging on the stone wall. A fat, dapple-gray pony had just ambled onto the grass and was grazing nonchalantly. Harry was used to the subjects of ",
        "Hogwarts paintings moving around and leaving A fat, dapple-gray pony frames to visit one another, but Harry always enjoyed watching it. A moment later, a short, squat knight in a suit of armor clanked into the picture after Harry pony. By the look of the grass stains on Harry metal knees, Harry had just fallen off. ",
        "\"Aha!\" Harry yelled, seeing Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"What villains are these, that trespass upon my private lands! Come to scorn at my fall, perchance? Draw, you knaves, you dogs!\" ",
        "They watched in astonishment as the little knight tugged the little knight sword out of the little knight scabbard and began brandishing the little knight violently, hopping up and down in rage. But his sword was too long for the little knight; a particularly wild swing made the little knight overbalance, and the little knight landed facedown in the grass. ",
        "\"Are you all right?\" said Harry, moving closer to the picture. ",
        "\"Get back, you scurvy braggart! Back, you rogue!\" ",
        "the little knight seized his sword again and used his sword to push the little knight back up, but the blade sank deeply into the grass and, though the little knight pulled with all the little knight might, the little knight couldn't get the blade out again. Finally, the little knight had to flop back down onto the grass and push up the little knight visor to mop the little knight sweating face. ",
        "\"Listen,\" said Harry, taking advantage of the little knight's exhaustion, \"we're looking for North Tower. You don't know the way, do you?\" ",
        "\"A quest!\" the little knight's rage seemed to vanish instantly. the little knight clanked to the little knight feet and shouted, \"Come follow me, dear friends, and we shall find we goal, or else shall perish bravely in the charge!\" ",
        "the little knight gave his sword another fruitless tug, tried and failed to mount the fat pony, gave up, and cried, \"On foot then, good sirs and gentle lady! On! On!\" ",
        "And the little knight ran, clanking loudly, into the left side of the frame and out of sight. ",
        "They hurried after the little knight along the corridor, following the sound of the little knight armor. Every now and then They spotted the little knight running through a picture ahead. ",
        "\"Be of stout heart, the worst is yet to come!\" yelled the little knight, and They saw the little knight reappear in front of an alarmed group of women in crinolines, whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase. ",
        "Puffing loudly, Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the tightly spiraling steps, getting dizzier and dizzier, until at last Ron, and Hermione heard the murmur of voices above Ron, and Hermione and knew Ron, and Hermione had reached the classroom. ",
        "\"Farewell!\" cried the little knight, popping the little knight into a painting of some sinister-looking monks. \"Farewell, my comrades-in-arms! If ever you have need of noble heart and steely sinew, call upon Sir Cadogan!\" ",
        "\"Yeah, well call you,\" muttered Ron as the little knight disappeared, \"if we ever need someone mental.\" ",
        "They climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a tiny landing, where most of the class was already assembled. There were no doors off a tiny landing, where most of the class was already assembled, but Ron nudged Harry and pointed at the ceiling, where there was a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on it.

        "\"After you,\" said Ron, grinning, so Harry climbed a silvery ladder first. ",
        "Harry emerged into the strangest-looking classroom Harry had ever seen. In fact, it didn't look like a classroom at all, more like a cross between someone's attic and an old-fashioned tea shop. At least twenty small, circular tables were crammed inside it, all surrounded by chintz armchairs and fat little poufs. Everything was lit with a dim, crimson light; the curtains at the windows were all closed, and the many lamps were draped with dark red scarves. It was stiflingly warm, and the fire that was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavy, sickly sort of perfume as the fire that was burning under the crowded mantelpiece heated a large copper kettle. The shelves running around the circular walls were crammed with dusty-looking feathers, stubs of candles, many packs of tattered playing cards, countless silvery crystal balls, and a huge array of teacups.

        "Ron appeared at Harry's shoulder as the class assembled around them, all talking in whispers. ",

        "\"Welcome,\" A voice said. \"How nice to see you in the physical world at last.\" ",
        "Harry's immediate impression was of a large, glittering insect. Professor Trelawney moved into the firelight, and they saw that Professor Trelawney was very thin; Professor Trelawney ",
        "large glasses magnified Professor Trelawney eyes to several times several times natural size, and Professor Trelawney was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl. Innumerable chains and beads hung around Professor Trelawney spindly neck, and Professor Trelawney arms and hands were encrusted with bangles and rings. ",
        "\"Sit, my children, sit,\" Professor Trelawney said, and my children climbed awkwardly into armchairs or sank onto poufs. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat Harry, Ron, and Hermione around the same round table. ",
        "\"Welcome to Divination,\" said Professor Trelawney, who had seated Professor Trelawney in a winged armchair in front of the fire. \"My name is Professor Trelawney. You may not have seen me before. I find that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my Inner Eye.\" ",
        "Nobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement. Professor Trelawney delicately rearranged a gauzy spangled shawl and continued, \"So you have chosen to study Divination, the most difficult of all magical arts. I must warn you at the outset that if you do not have the Sight, there is very little I will be able to teach you. Books can take you only so far in this field. ...\" ",
        "At these words, both Harry, Ron, and Hermione glanced, grinning, at Hermione, who looked startled at the news that books wouldn't be much help in this subject. ",
        "\"Many witches and wizards, talented though \"Many witches and wizards are in the area of loud bangs and smells and sudden disappearings, are yet unable to penetrate the veiled mysteries of the future,\" Professor Trelawney Professor Trelawney went on, Professor Trelawney enormous, gleaming eyes moving from face to nervous face. \"It is a Gift granted to few. You, boy,\" ",
        "Professor Trelawney said suddenly to Neville, who almost toppled off his pouf. \"Is your grandmother well?\" ",
        "\"I think so,\" said Neville tremulously. ",
        "\"I wouldn't be so sure if I were you, dear,\" said Professor Trelawney, the firelight glinting on Professor Trelawney long emerald earrings. Neville gulped. Professor Trelawney continued placidly. \"We will be covering the basic methods of Divination this year. The first term will be devoted to reading the tea leaves. Next term we shall progress to palmistry. By the way, my dear,\" Professor Trelawney shot suddenly at Parvati Patil, \"beware a red-haired man.\" ",
        "Parvati gave a startled look at Ron, who was right behind Professor Trelawney, and edged Professor Trelawney chair away from Ron, who was right behind her. ",
        "\"In the second term,\" Professor Trelawney went on, ",
        "\"we shall progress to the crystal ball -- if we have finished with fire omens, that is. Unfortunately, classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout of flu. I myself will lose my voice. And around Easter, one of we number will leave we forever.\" ",
        "A very tense silence followed this extraordinary pronouncement, but Professor Trelawney Professor Trelawney seemed unaware of this extraordinary pronouncement. ",
        "\"I wonder, dear,\" Professor Trelawney said to Lavender Brown, who was nearest and shrank back in her chair, \"if you could pass me the largest silver teapot?\" ",
        "Lavender, looking relieved, stood up, took an enormous teapot from the shelf, and put an enormous teapot from the shelf down on the table in front of Professor Trelawney. ",
        "\"Thank you, my dear. Incidentally, that thing you are dreading -- it will happen on Friday the sixteenth of October.\" ",
        "Lavender trembled. ",
        "\"Now, I want you all to divide into pairs. Collect a teacup from the shelf, come to \" ",
        "Lavender, and I will fill a teacup from the shelf. Then sit down and drink, drink until only the dregs remain. Swill these around the cup three times with the left hand, then turn the cup upside down on a teacup from the shelf saucer, wait for the last of the tea to drain away, then give your cup to your partner to read. You will interpret the patterns using pages five and six of Unfogging the Future. I shall move among you, helping and instructing. Oh, and dear\" -- she caught Neville by the arm as Neville made to stand up -- \"after you've broken your cup, would you be so kind as to select one of the blue patterned ones? I'm rather attached to the pink.\" ",
        "Sure enough, Neville had no sooner reached the shelf of teacups when there was a tinkle of breaking china. Professor Trelawney swept over to Professor Trelawney holding a dustpan and brush and said, \"One of the blue ones, then, dear, if you wouldn't mind ... thank you. ...\" ",
        "When Harry, Ron, and Hermione had had Harry, Ron, and Hermione teacups filled, Harry, Ron, and Hermione went back to Harry, Ron, and Hermione table and tried to drink the scalding tea quickly. Harry, Ron, and Hermione swilled the dregs around as Professor Trelawney Professor Trelawney had instructed, then drained the cups and swapped over. ",
        "\"Right,\" said Ron as they both opened they both books at pages five and six. \"What can you see in mine?\" ",
        "\"A load of soggy brown stuff,\" said Harry. The heavily perfumed smoke in the room was making Harry feel sleepy and stupid. ",
        "\"Broaden your minds, my dears, and allow your eyes to see past the mundane!\" Professor Trelawney Professor Trelawney cried through the gloom. ",
        "Harry tried to pull Harry together. ",
        "\"Right, you've got a crooked sort of cross ...\" Professor Trelawney consulted Unfogging the Future. \"That means you're going to have 'trials and suffering' -- sorry about that -- but there's a thing that could be the sun ... hang on ... that means 'great happiness' ... so you're going to suffer but be very happy. ...\" ",
        "\"You need your Inner Eye tested, if you ask me,\" said Ron, and they both had to stifle they both laughs as Professor Trelawney Professor Trelawney gazed in they both direction. ",
        "\"My turn ...\" Ron peered into Harry's teacup, Ron forehead wrinkled with effort. \"There's a blob a bit like a bowler hat,\" Ron said. \"Maybe you're going to work for the Ministry of Magic. ...\" ",
        "Ron turned Harry's teacup the other way up. ",
        "\"But this way it looks more like an acorn. ... What's that?\" Ron scanned Ron copy of Unfogging the Future. \" 'A windfall, unexpected gold.' Excellent, you can lend me some ... and there's a thing here,\" Ron turned the cup again, \"that looks like an animal . . . yeah, if that was its head ... that was its head looks like a hippo ... no, a sheep ...\" ",
        "Professor Trelawney whirled around as Harry let out a snort of laughter. ",
        "\"Let me see that, my dear,\" she said reprovingly to Ron, sweeping over and snatching Harry's cup from Ron. Everyone went quiet to watch. ",
        "Professor Trelawney was staring into Harry's teacup, rotating Harry's teacup counterclockwise. ",
        "\"The falcon ... my dear, you have a deadly enemy.\" ",
        "\"But everyone knows that,\" said Hermione in a loud whisper. Professor Trelawney stared at Professor Trelawney. ",
        "\"Well, they do,\" said Hermione. \"Everybody knows about Harry and You-Know-Who.\" ",
        "Harry and Ron stared at Professor Trelawney with a mixture of amazement and admiration. \" ",
        "Harry and Ron had never heard Hermione speak to a teacher like that before. ",
        "Professor Trelawney chose not to reply. Professor Trelawney lowered Professor Trelawney huge eyes to Harry's cup again and continued to turn Harry's cup. ",
        "\"The club ... an attack. Dear, dear, this is not a happy cup. ...\" ",
        "\"I thought that was a bowler hat,\" said Ron sheepishly. ",
        "\"The skull ... danger in your path, my dear. ...\" ",
        "Everyone was staring, transfixed, at Professor Trelawney, who gave the cup a final turn, gasped, and then screamed. ",
        "There was another tinkle of breaking chinachina; Neville had smashed Neville second cup. Professor Trelawney sank into a vacant armchair, Professor Trelawney glittering hand at Professor Trelawney heart and Professor Trelawney eyes closed. ",
        "\"My dear boy . . . my poor, dear boy ... no ... it is kinder not to say ... no ... don't ask me. ...\" ",
        "\"What is it, Professor Trelawney?\" said Dean Thomas at once. Everyone had got to Everyone feet, and slowly Everyone crowded around Harry and Ron's table, pressing close to Professor Trelawney's chair to get a good look at Harry's cup. ",
        "\"My dear,\" Professor Trelawney's huge eyes opened dramatically, \"you have the Grim.\" ",
        "\"The what?\" said Harry. ",
        "Harry could tell that Harry wasn't the only one who didn't understand; Dean Thomas shrugged at Harry and Lavender Brown looked puzzled, but nearly everybody else clapped Dean Thomas shrugged at him and Lavender Brown hands to Dean Thomas shrugged at him and Lavender Brown mouths in horror. ",
        "\"the Grim, my dear, the Grim!\" cried Professor Trelawney, who looked shocked that Harry hadn't understood. \"The giant, spectral dog that haunts churchyards! My dear boy, it is an omen -- the worst omen -- of death .!\" ",
        "Harry's stomach lurched. That dog on the cover of Death Omens in Flourish and Blotts -- the dog in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent . . . Lavender Brown clapped Lavender Brown hands to Lavender Brown mouth too. Everyone was looking at Harry, everyone except Hermione, who had gotten up and moved around to the back of Professor Trelawney's chair. ",
        "\"I don't think it looks like a Grim,\" Lavender Brown said flatly. ",
        "Professor Trelawney surveyed Hermione with mounting dislike. ",
        "\"You'll forgive me for saying so, my dear, but I perceive very little aura around my dear. Very little receptivity to the resonances of the future.\" ",
        "Seamus Finnigan was tilting Seamus Finnigan head from side to side. ",
        "\"It looks like a Grim if you do this,\" Seamus Finnigan said, with Seamus Finnigan eyes almost shut, \"but it looks more like a donkey from here,\" Seamus Finnigan said, leaning to the left. ",
        "\"When you've all finished deciding whether I'm going to die or not!\" said Harry, taking even Harry by surprise. Now nobody seemed to want to look at Harry. ",
        "\"I think we will leave the lesson here for today,\" said Professor Trelawney in Professor Trelawney mistiest voice. \"Yes ... please pack away your things. ...\" ",
        "Silently the class took the class teacups back to Professor Trelawney, packed away the class books, and closed the class bags. Ron Ron was avoiding Harry's eyes. ",
        "\"Until we meet again,\" said Professor Trelawney Professor Trelawney faintly, \"fair fortune be yours. Oh, and dear\" -- Professor Trelawney pointed at Neville -- \"you'll be late next time, so mind you work extra-hard to catch up.\" ",
        "Harry, Ron, and Hermione descended Professor Trelawney's ladder and the winding stair in silence, then set off for Professor McGonagall's Transfiguration lesson. It took \" ",
        "Harry, Ron, and Hermione so long to find Professor Trelawney classroom that, early as \" ",
        "Harry, Ron, and Hermione had left Divination, \" ",
        "Harry, Ron, and Hermione were only just in time. ",
        "Harry chose a seat right at the back of the room, feeling as though Harry were sitting in a very bright spotlight; the rest of the class kept shooting furtive glances at Harry, as though Harry were about to drop dead at any moment. Harry hardly heard what Professor McGonagall was telling them about Animagi (wizards who could transform at will into animals), and wasn't even watching when Professor McGonagall transformed Professor McGonagall in front of them eyes into a tabby cat with spectacle markings around Professor McGonagall eyes. ",
        "\"Really, what has got into you all today?\" said Professor McGonagall, turning back into Professor McGonagall with a faint pop, and staring around at them all. \"Not that ",
        "",
        " matters, but that's the first time my transformation's not got applause from a class.\" ",
        "Everybody's heads turned toward Harry again, but nobody spoke. Then Hermione raised Professor McGonagall hand. ",
        "\"Please, Professor Trelawney, we've just had we first Divination class, and we were reading the tea leaves, and -- \" ",
        "\"Ah, of course,\" said Professor McGonagall, suddenly frowning. \"There is no need to say any more, Miss Granger. Tell me, which of Professor Trelawney will be dying this year?\" ",
        "Everyone stared at Professor McGonagall. ",
        "\"Me,\" said Harry, finally. ",
        "\"I see,\" said Professor McGonagall, fixing Harry with Professor McGonagall beady eyes. \"Then you should know, Potter, that Professor Trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since Professor McGonagall arrived at this school. None of that has died yet. Seeing death omens is Professor McGonagall favorite way of greeting a new class. If it were not for the fact that I never speak ill of my colleagues -- \" ",
        "Professor McGonagall broke off, and they saw that Professor McGonagall nostrils had gone white. Professor McGonagall went on, more calmly, \"Divination is one of the most imprecise branches of magic. I shall not conceal from Professor Trelawney that I have very little patience with it. True Seers are very rare, and Professor Trelawney \" ",
        "Professor McGonagall stopped again, and then said, in a very matter-of- fact tone, \"You look in excellent health to me, Potter, so you will excuse me if I don't let you off homework today. I assure you that if you die, you need not hand it in.\" ",
        "Hermione laughed. Harry felt a bit better. It was harder to feel scared of a lump of tea leaves away from the dim red light and befuddling perfume of Professor Trelawney's classroom. Not everyone was convinced, however. Ron still looked worried, and Lavender whispered, \"But what about Neville's cup?\" ",
        "When the Transfiguration class had finished, the Transfiguration class joined the crowd thundering toward the Great Hall for lunch. ",
        "\"Ron, cheer up,\" said Hermione, pushing a dish of stew toward Ron. \"You heard what Professor McGonagall said.\" ",
        "Ron spooned stew onto Ron plate and picked up Ron fork but didn't start. ",
        "\"Harry,\" Ron said, in a low, serious voice, \"you haven't seen a great black dog anywhere, have you?\" ",
        "\"Yeah, I have,\" said Harry. \"I saw one the night I left the Dursleys'.\" ",
        "Ron let his fork fall with a clatter. ",
        "\"Probably a stray,\" said Hermione calmly. ",
        "Ron looked at Hermione as though Hermione had gone mad. ",
        "Hermione, if Harry's seen a Grim, that's -- that's bad,\" Ron said. \"My -- my uncle Bilius saw one and -- and my uncle Bilius died twenty-four hours later!\" ",
        "\"Coincidence,\" said Hermione airily, pouring Hermione some pumpkin juice. ",
        "\"You don't know what you're talking about!\" said Ron, starting to get angry. \"Grims scare the living daylights out of most wizards!\" ",
        "\"There you are, then,\" said Hermione in a superior tone. \"They see the Grim and die of fright. the Grim's not an omen, it's the cause of death! And Harry's still with us because Harry's not stupid enough to see one and think, right, well, I'd better kick the bucket then!Ron Ron mouthed wordlessly at Hermione, who opened her bag, took out her new Arithmancy book, and propped her new Arithmancy book open against the juice jug. ",
        "\"I think Divination seems very woolly,\" her said, searching for her page. \"A lot of guesswork, if you ask me.\" ",
        "\"There was nothing woolly about the Grim in that cup!\" said Ron hotly. ",
        "\"You didn't seem quite so confident when you were telling Harry it was a sheep,\" said Hermione coolly. ",
        "\"Professor Trelawney said you didn't have the right aura! You just don't like being bad at something for a change!\" ",
        "Professor Trelawney had touched a nerve. Hermione slammed her new Arithmancy book down on the table so hard that bits of meat and carrot flew everywhere. ",
        "\"If being good at Divination means I have to pretend to see death omens in a lump of tea leaves, I'm not sure I'll be studying being good at Divination much longer! That lesson was absolute rubbish compared with my Arithmancy class!\" ",
        "her snatched up her bag and stalked away. ",
        "Ron frowned after her. ",
        "\"What's her talking about?\" Ron said to Harry. \"her hasn't been to an Arithmancy class yet.\" ",
        "Harry was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch. Yesterday's rain had cleared; the sky was a clear, pale gray, and the grass was springy and damp underfoot as they set off for they first ever Care of Magical Creatures class. ",
        "Ron and Hermione weren't speaking to each other. Harry walked beside Ron and Hermione in silence as Ron and Hermione went down the sloping lawns to Hagrid's hut on the edge of the Forbidden Forest. It was only when Harry spotted three only-too-familiar backs ahead of Ron and Hermione that Harry realized Ron and Hermione must be having these lessons with the Slytherins. Malfoy was talking animatedly to Crabbe and Goyle, who were chortling. Harry was quite sure Harry knew what Ron and Hermione were talking about. ",
        "Hagrid's was waiting for Harry class at the door of Hagrid's hut. Harry stood in Harry moleskin overcoat, with Fang the boarhound at Harry heels, looking impatient to start. ",
        "\"C'mon, now, get a move on!\" Harry called as his class approached. \"Got a real treat for yeh today! Great lesson cornin' up! Everyone here? Right, follow me!\" ",
        "For one nasty moment, Harry thought that Hagrid's was going to lead them into the Forbidden Forest; Harry had had enough unpleasant experiences in there to last Harry a lifetime. However, Hagrid's strolled off around the edge of the trees, and five minutes later, Hagrid's found Hagrid's outside a kind of paddock. There was nothing in there. ",
        "\"Everyone gather 'round the fence here!\" Harry called. \"That's it -- make sure yeh can see -- now, firs' thing yeh'll want ter do is open yer books -- \" ",
        "\"How?\" said the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy. ",
        "\"Eh?\" said Hagrid's. ",
        "\"How do we open we books?\" Draco Malfoy repeated. Draco Malfoy took out Draco Malfoy copy of The Monster Book of Monsters, which Draco Malfoy had bound shut with a length of rope. Other people took Other people out too; some, like Harry, had belted Other people book shut; others had crammed Other people inside tight bags or clamped Other people together with binder clips. ",
        "\"Hasn' -- hasn' anyone bin able ter open anyone bin books?\" said Hagrid's, looking anyone bin able ter. ",
        "The class all shook The class all heads. ",
        "\"Yeh've got ter stroke 'em,\" said Hagrid's, as though this was the most obvious thing in the world. \"Look -- ",
        "He took Hermione's copy and ripped off the Spellotape that bound Hermione's copy. Hermione's copy tried to bite, but Hagrid's ran a giant forefinger down Hermione's copy spine, and Hermione's copy shivered, and then fell open and lay quiet in Hagrid's hand. ",
        "\"Oh, how silly we've all been!\" Malfoy sneered. \"we should have stroked his hand! Why didn't we guess!\" ",
        "\"I -- I thought his hand were funny,\" Hagrid's said uncertainly to Hermione. ",
        "\"Oh, tremendously funny!\" said Malfoy. \"Really witty, giving we books that try and rip we hands off!\" ",
        "\"Shut up, Malfoy,\" said Harry quietly. Hagrid's was looking downcast and Harry wanted Hagrid's 's first lesson to be a success. ",
        "\"Righ' then,\" said Hagrid, who seemed to have lost his thread, \"so -- so yeh've got yer books an' -- an' -- now yeh need the Magical Creatures. Yeah. So I'll go an' get 'em. Hang on ...\" ",
        "his strode away from them into the forest and out of sight. ",
        "\"God, this place is going to the dogs,\" said Malfoy loudly. \"That oaf teaching classes, my father'll have a fit when I tell my father'll -- \" ",
        "\"Shut up, Malfoy,\" Harry repeated. ",
        "\"Careful, Potter, there's a dementor behind you -- \" ",
        "\"Oooooooh!\" squealed Lavender Brown, pointing toward the opposite side of the paddock. ",
        "Trotting toward them were a dozen of the most bizarre creatures Harry had ever seen. them had the bodies, hind legs, and tails of horses, but the front legs, wings, and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles, with cruel, steel-colored beaks and large, brilliantly orange eyes. The talons on their front legs were half a foot long and deadly looking. Each of the beasts had a thick leather collar around Each of the beasts neck, which was attached to a long chain, and the ends of all of Each of the beasts were held in the vast hands of Hagrid, who came jogging into the paddock behind the creatures.

        "\"Gee up, there!\" he roared, shaking the chains and urging the creatures toward the fence where the class stood. Everyone drew back slightly as Hagrid reached Everyone and tethered the creatures to the fence. ",
        "\"Hippogriffs!\" Hagrid roared happily, waving a hand at Everyone. \"Beau'iful, aren' they?\" ",
        "Harry could sort of see what Hagrid meant. Once you got over the first shock of seeing something that was half horse, half bird, you started to appreciate the hippogriffs' gleaming coats, changing smoothly from feather to hair, each of hair a different color: stormy gray, bronze, pinkish roan, gleaming chestnut, and inky black. ",
        "\"So,\" said Hagrid, rubbing Hagrid hands together and beaming around, \"if yeh wan' ter come a bit nearer -- \" ",
        "No one seemed to want to. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, approached the fence cautiously. ",
        "\"Now, firs' thing Yeh gotta know abou' hippogriffs is, they're proud,\" said Hagrid. \"Easily offended, hippogriffs are. Don't never insult one, 'cause it might be the last thing yeh do.\" ",
        "Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle weren't listening; Crabbe, and Goyle were talking in an undertone and Harry had a nasty feeling Crabbe, and Goyle were plotting how best to disrupt the lesson. ",
        "\"Yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs' move,\" Hagrid continued. \"It's polite, see? Yeh walk toward Yeh, and yeh bow, an' Yeh wait. If Yeh bows back, yeh're allowed ter touch Yeh. If Yeh doesn' bow, then get away from Yeh sharpish, 'cause those talons hurt. ",
        "\"Right -- who wants ter go first?\" ",
        "Most of the class backed farther away in answer. ",
        "Even Harry, Ron, and Hermione had misgivings. abou' hippogriffs were tossing Even Harry, Ron, and Hermione fierce heads and flexing ",
        "Even Harry, Ron, and Hermione powerful wings; Even Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn't seem to like being tethered like this. ",
        "\"No one?\" said Hagrid, with a pleading look. ",
        "\"I'll do it,\" said Harry. ",
        "There was an intake of breath from behind Harry, and both Lavender and Parvati whispered, \"Oooh, no, Harry, remember your tea leaves!\" ",
        "Harry ignored Lavender and Parvati. \" ",
        "Harry climbed over the paddock fence. ",

        "\" ",
        "Harry untied one of the chains, pulled the gray hippogriff away from the gray hippogriff fellows, and slipped off the gray hippogriff leather collar. The class on the other side of the paddock seemed to be holding the paddock breath. Malfoy's eyes were narrowed maliciously. ",

        "Harry's eyes immediately began to water, but Harry didn't shut Harry's eyes. Buckbeak had turned Harry great, sharp head and was staring at Harry with one fierce orange eye. ",

        "Harry didn't feel much like exposing the back of Harry neck to Buckbeak, but Harry did as Harry was told. Harry gave a short bow and then looked up. ",

        "But then, to Harry's enormous surprise, the gray hippogriff suddenly bent the gray hippogriff scaly front knees and sank into what was an unmistakable bow. ",

        "Feeling that a better reward would have been to back away, Harry moved slowly toward the gray hippogriff and reached out toward the gray hippogriff. Harry patted his beak several times and the gray hippogriff closed his beak eyes lazily, as though enjoying his beak. ",
        "the class broke into applause, all except for Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were looking deeply disappointed. ",
        "\"Righ' then, Harry,\" said Hagrid. \"I reckon Hagrid might' let Yeh ride Yeh!\" ",
        "This was more than Harry had bargained for. Harry was used to a broomstick; but Harry wasn't sure a hippogriff would be quite the same. ",

        "Without warning, twelve-foot wings flapped open on either side of Harry; Harry just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before Harry was soaring upward. It was nothing like a broomstick, and Harry knew which one Harry preferred; twelve-foot wings beat uncomfortably on either side of Harry, catching Harry under Harry legs and making Harry feel Harry was about to be thrown off; the glossy feathers slipped under Harry fingers and Harry didn't dare get a stronger grip; instead of the smooth action of Harry Nimbus Two Thousand, Harry now felt Harry rocking backward and forward as the hindquarters of the gray hippogriff rose and fell with the gray hippogriff wings.

        "Buckbeak flew Harry once around the paddock and then headed back to the ground; this was the bit Harry had been dreading; Harry leaned back as the smooth neck lowered, feeling Harry was going to slip off over his beak, then felt a heavy thud as the four ill- assorted feet hit the ground. Harry just managed to hold on and push Harry straight again. ",
        "\"Good work, Harry!\" roared Hagrid as everyone except Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle cheered. \"Okay, who else wants a go?\" ",
        "Emboldened by Harry's success, the rest of the class climbed cautiously into the paddock. Hagrid untied the hippogriffs one by one, and soon people were bowing nervously, all over the paddock. Neville ran repeatedly backward from Neville, which didn't seem to want to bend Hagrid knees. Even Harry, Ron, and Hermione practiced on the chestnut, while Harry watched. ",
        "Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had taken over Buckbeak. Harry had bowed to Malfoy, who was now patting Harry beak, looking disdainful. ",
        "\"This is very easy,\" Malfoy drawled, loud enough for Harry to hear Harry. \"I knew it must have been, if Potter could do it. ... I bet you're not dangerous at all, are you?\" Harry said to the gray hippogriff. \"Are you, you great ugly brute?\" ",
        "It happened in a flash of steely talons; Malfoy let out a high-pitched scream and next moment, Hagrid was wrestling Buckbeak back into Hagrid collar as Hagrid strained to get at Malfoy, who lay curled in the grass, blood blossoming over Hagrid robes. ",

        "Professor Lupin wasn't there when they arrived at Professor Lupin first Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. they sat down, took out they books, quills, and parchment, and were talking when Professor Lupin finally entered the room.

Professor Lupin was as shabby as ever but looked healthier than Professor Lupin had on the train, as though Professor Lupin had had a few square meals. ",
        "\"Good afternoon,\" Professor Lupin said. \"Would you please put all your books back in your bags. Today's will be a practical lesson. You will need only your wands.\" ",

        "\"Right then,\" said Professor Lupin, when everyone was ready. \"If you'd follow me.\" ",
        "Puzzled but interested, the class got to the class feet and followed Professor Lupin Professor Lupin out of the classroom. Professor Lupin led them along the deserted corridor and around a corner, where the first thing them saw was Peeves the Poltergeist, who was floating upside down in midair and stuffing the nearest keyhole with chewing gum.

        "Professor Lupin was the Hogwarts caretaker, a bad-tempered, failed wizard who waged a constant war against the students and, indeed, Peeves. However, Peeves paid no attention to Professor Lupin's words, except to blow a loud wet raspberry. ",

        "\"This is a useful little spell,\" Professor Lupin told the class over Professor Lupin shoulder. \"Please watch closely.\" ",

        "\" Waddiwasil \" and pointed his wand at Peeves. ",
        "With the force of a bullet, the wad of chewing gum shot out of the keyhole and straight down Peeves 's left nostril; Professor Lupin whirled upright and zoomed away, cursing. ",

        "\"Thank you, Dean,\" said Professor Lupin, putting his wand away again. \"Shall we proceed?\" ",
        "They set off again, the class looking at Professor Lupin with increased respect. Professor Lupin led They down a second corridor and stopped, right outside the staffroom door. ",
        "\"Inside, please,\" said Professor Lupin, opening it and standing back. ",
        "The staffroom, a long, paneled room full of old, mismatched chairs, was empty except for one teacher. Professor Snape was sitting in a low armchair, and Professor Snape looked around as the class filed in. Professor Snape eyes were glittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around her mouth. As Professor Lupin came in and made to close the door behind Professor Snape, Professor Snape said, \"Leave it open, Professor Lupin. Td rather not witness this.\" ",

        "\"Now, then,\" said Professor Lupin, beckoning the class toward the end of the room, where there was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers kept the teachers spare robes. As Professor Lupin Professor Lupin went to stand next to it, an old wardrobe where the teachers kept their spare robes gave a sudden wobble, banging off the wall. ",
        "\"Nothing to worry about,\" said Professor Lupin Professor Lupin calmly because a few people had jumped backward in alarm. \"There's a boggart in there.\" ",
        "Most people seemed to feel that this was something to worry about. Neville gave Professor Lupin a look of pure terror, and Seamus Finnigan eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively. ",
        "\"Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,\" said Professor Lupin. \"Wardrobes, the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks -- I've even met one that had lodged it in a grandfather clock. This one moved in yesterday afternoon, and I asked the headmaster if the staff would leave This one to give my third years some practice. ",
        "\"So, the first question we must ask we is, what is a boggart?\" ",
        "Hermione put up Hermione hand. ",
        "\"It's a shape-shifter,\" Hermione said. \"It can take the shape of whatever It thinks will frighten us most.\" ",
        "\"Couldn't have put it better Hermione,\" said Professor Lupin, and Hermione glowed. \"So the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a form. ",
        "the boggart sitting in the darkness does not yet know what will frighten the person on ",
        "the other side of the door. Nobody knows what a boggart looks like when the boggart sitting in the darkness is alone, but when I let the boggart sitting in the darkness out, the boggart sitting in the darkness will immediately become whatever each of us most fears. ",
        "\"This means,\" said Professor Lupin, choosing to ignore Neville's small sputter of terror, \"that we have a huge advantage over the boggart sitting in the darkness before we begin. ",
        "Have you spotted it, Harry?\" ",
        "Trying to answer a question with Hermione next to Harry, bobbing up and down on the balls of his curly-toed feet with Hermione hand in the air, was very off-putting, but Harry had a go. ",
        "\"Er -- because there are so many of us, it won't know what shape it should be?\" ",
        "\"Precisely,\" said Professor Lupin, and Hermione put her hand down, looking a little disappointed. \"It's always best to have company when you're dealing with a boggart. a boggart becomes confused. Which should a boggart become, a headless corpse or a flesh-eating slug? I once saw a boggart make that very mistake -- tried to frighten two people at once and turned a boggart into half a slug. Not remotely frightening. ",
        "\"The charm that repels a boggart is simple, yet a boggart requires force of mind. You see, the thing that really finishes a boggart is laughter. What you need to do is force a boggart to assume a shape that you find amusing. ",
        "\"us will practice the charm without wands first. After me, please ... riddikulusV' ",
        "\" RiddikulusV' said the class together. ",

        "is not enough. And this is where you come in, Neville.\" ",
        "an old wardrobe where the teachers kept their spare robes shook again, though not as much as Neville, who walked forward as though a boggart were heading for the gallows. ",

        "Neville's lips moved, but no noise came out. ",
        "\"Didn't catch that, Neville, sorry,\" said Professor Lupin cheerfully. ",
        "Neville looked around rather wildly, as though begging someone to help Neville, then said, in barely more than a whisper, Professor Snape.\" ",

        "\"Er -- yes,\" said Neville nervously. \"But -- I don't want the boggart to turn into your grandmother either.\" ",
        "\"No, no, you misunderstand me,\" said Professor Lupin, now smiling. \"I wonder, could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usually wears?\" ",
        "Neville looked startled, but said, \"Well ... always the same hat. A tall one with a stuffed vulture on top. ",
        "And a long dress ... green, normally ... and sometimes a fox-fur scarf.\" ",

The third time this happened, Oliver Wood talked for so long that Harry suddenly realized Harry was ten minutes late for Defense Against the Dark Arts, and set off at a run with Oliver Wood shouting after Harry, \"Diggory's got a very fast swerve, Harry, so you might want to try looping Harry -- \" ",
        "Harry skidded to a halt outside the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, pulled the door open, and dashed inside. ",
        "\"Sorry I'm late, Professor Lupin, I -- \" ",
        "But it wasn't Professor Lupin who looked up at Professor Lupin from the teacher's desk; it was Snape. ",
        "\"This lesson began ten minutes ago, Potter, so I think we'll make it ten points from Gryffindor. Sit down.\" ",
        "But Harry didn't move. ",
        "\"Where's Professor Lupin?\" Harry said. ",
        "\"Harry says Harry is feeling too ill to teach today,\" said Snape with a twisted smile. \"I believe I told you to sit down?\" ",
        "But Harry stayed where Harry was. ",
        "\"What's wrong with Harry?\" ",
        "Snape 's black eyes glittered. ",
        "\"Nothing life-threatening,\" Harry said, looking as though Harry wished it were. \"Five more points from Gryffindor, and if I have to ask you to sit down again, it will be fifty.\" ",
        "Harry walked slowly to Harry seat and sat down. Snape looked around at the class. ",
        "\"As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor Lupin Professor Lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far -- \" ",
        "\"Please, sir, we've done boggarts, Red Caps, kappas, and grindylows,\" said Hermione quickly, \"and we're just about to start -- \" ",
        "\"Be quiet,\" said Snape coldly. \"I did not ask for information. I was merely commenting on Professor Lupin's lack of organization.\" ",
        "\"Snape's the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we've ever had,\" said Dean Thomas boldly, and there was a murmur of agreement from the rest of the class. Snape looked more menacing than ever. ",
        "\"You are easily satisfied. Professor Lupin is hardly overtaxing you -- I would expect first years to be able to deal with Red Caps and grindylows. Today we shall discuss -- \" ",
        "Harry watched Snape flick through the textbook, to the very back chapter, which Snape must know they hadn't covered. ",
        "\" -- werewolves,\" said Snape. ",
        "\"But, sir,\" said Hermione, seemingly unable to restrain \" ",
        "Harry, \"we're not supposed to do werewolves yet, we're due to start hinkypunks -- \" ",
        "\"Miss Granger,\" said Snape in a voice of deadly calm, \"I was under the impression that I am teaching this lesson, not you. And I am telling you all to turn to page 394.\" Snape glanced around again. \"All of you! ",
        "Now\\\" ",
        "With many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen muttering, the class opened \" ",
        "With many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen muttering books. ",
        "\"Which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and the true wolf?\" said Snape. ",
        "Everyone sat in motionless silence; everyone except Hermione, whose hand, as it so often did, had shot straight into the air. ",
        "\"Anyone?\" Snape said, ignoring Hermione. Snape twisted smile was back. \"Are you telling me that Professor Lupin hasn't even taught you the basic distinction between -- \" ",
        "\"We told you,\" said Parvati suddenly, \"We haven't got as far as werewolves yet, We're still on -- \" ",
        "\"Silencel\" snarled Snape. \"Well, well, well, I never thought I'd meet a third -year class who wouldn't even recognize a werewolf when they saw one. I shall make a point of informing Professor Dumbledore how very behind you all are. ...\" ",
        "\"Please, sir,\" said Hermione, whose hand was still in the air, \"the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways. The snout of the werewolf -- \" ",
        "\"That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger,\" said Snape coolly. \"Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all.\" ",
        "Hermione went very red, put down whose hand, and stared at the floor with Hermione eyes full of tears. It was a mark of how much the class loathed Snape that the class were all glaring at Snape, because every one of the class had called Hermione a know-it-all at least once, and Ron, who told Hermione she was a know-it-all at least twice a week, said loudly, \"You asked the class a question and she knows the answer! Why ask if you don't want to be told?\" ",
        "the class knew instantly the class'd gone too far. Snape advanced on Ron slowly, and the room held the room breath. ",
        "\"Detention, Weasley,Snape Snape said silkily, Snape face very close to Ron's. \"And if I ever hear you criticize the way I teach a class again, you will be very sorry indeed.\" ",
        "No one made a sound throughout the rest of the lesson. No one sat and made notes on werewolves from the textbook, while Snape prowled up and down the rows of desks, examining the work No one had been doing with Professor Lupin. ",
        "\"Very poorly explained . . . That is incorrect, the kappa is more commonly found in Mongolia. . . . Professor Lupin gave this eight out of ten? I wouldn't have given the kappa three. ...\" ",
        "When the bell rang at last, Snape held the bell back. ",
        "\"You will each write an essay, to be handed in to me, on the ways you recognize and kill werewolves. I want two rolls of parchment on the subject, and I want two rolls of parchment on the subject by Monday morning. It is time somebody took the class in hand. Weasley, stay behind, we need to arrange your detention.\" ",
        "Harry and Hermione left the room with the rest of the class, who waited until Harry and Hermione were well out of earshot, then burst into a furious tirade about Snape. ",
        "Snape Snape 's never been like this with any of our other Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, even if he did want the job,Harry Harry said to Hermione. \"Why's he got it in for Professor Lupin? D'you think this is all because of the boggart?\" ",
        "\"I don't know,\" said Hermione pensively. \"But I really hope Professor Lupin gets better soon. ...\" ",
        "Ron caught up with them five minutes later, in a towering rage. ",
        "\"D'you know what that -- \" (D'you called Snape something that made Hermione say \"Ron\\\") \" -- is making me do? I've got to scrub out the bedpans in the hospital wing. Without magid\" magid was breathing deeply, magid fists clenched. \"Why couldn't Black have hidden in Snape's office, eh? magid could have finished magid off for us!\" ",
        "Harry woke extremely early the next morning; so early that it was still dark. For a moment Harry thought the roaring of the wind had woken Harry. Then Harry felt a cold breeze on the back of Harry neck and sat bolt upright -- Peeves had been floating next to Harry, blowing hard in Harry ear. ",
        "\"What did you do that for?\" said Harry furiously. ",
        "Peeves puffed out Harry cheeks, blew hard, and zoomed backward out of the room, cackling. ",
        "Harry fumbled for Harry alarm clock and looked at his alarm clock. his alarm clock was half past four. Cursing Peeves, Harry rolled over and tried to get back to sleep, but it was very difficult, now that Harry was awake, to ignore the sounds of the thunder rumbling overhead, the pounding of the wind against the castle walls, and the distant creaking of the trees in the Forbidden Forest. In a few hours Harry would be out on the Quidditch field, battling through the gale outside. Finally, Harry gave up any thought of more sleep, got up, dressed, picked up Harry Nimbus Two Thousand, and walked quietly out of the dormitory. ",
        "As Harry opened the door, something brushed against Harry leg. Harry bent down just in time to grab Crookshanks by the end of Harry bushy tail and drag Harry outside. ",
        "\"You know, I reckon Ron was right about you,Harry Harry told Crookshanks suspiciously. \"There are plenty of ",
        "mice around this place -- go and chase mice around this place. Go on,\" Ron added, nudging Crookshanks down the spiral staircase with Ron foot. \"Leave Scabbers alone.\" ",
        "The noise of the storm was even louder in the common room. Harry knew better than to think the match would be canceled; Quidditch matches weren't called off for trifles like thunderstorms. Nevertheless, Harry was starting to feel very apprehensive. Oliver Wood had pointed out Cedric Diggory to Harry in the corridor; Cedric Diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than Harry. Seekers were usually light and speedy, but Cedric Diggory's weight would be an advantage in this weather because Harry was less likely to be blown off course. ",
        "Harry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of the fire, getting up every now and then to stop Crookshanks from sneaking up the boys' staircase again. At long last Harry thought it must be time for breakfast, so Harry headed through the portrait hole alone. ",
        "\"Stand and fight, you mangy cur!\" yelled Sir Cadogan. \"Oh, shut up,\" Harry yawned. ",
        "Harry revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge, and by the time Harry'd started on toast, the rest of the team had turned up. ",
        "\"It's going to be a tough one,\" said Wood, who wasn't eating anything. ",
        "\"Stop worrying, Oliver,\" said Alicia soothingly, \"we don't mind a bit of rain.\" ",
        "But it was considerably more than a bit of rain. Such was the popularity of Quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as usual, but they ran ",
        "down the lawns toward the Quidditch field, heads bowed against the ferocious wind, umbrellas being whipped out of they hands as they went. Just before Harry entered the locker room, Harry saw Malfoy, ",
        "Crabbe, and Goyle, laughing and pointing at Harry from under an enormous umbrella on their way to the stadium. ",
        "the team changed into the team scarlet robes and waited for Oliver Wood's usual pre-match pep talk, but it didn't come. Harry tried to speak several times, made an odd gulping noise, then shook Harry head hopelessly and beckoned the crowd to follow Harry. ",
        "The wind was so strong that the crowd staggered sideways as the crowd walked out onto the Quidditch field. If the crowd was cheering, the crowd couldn't hear it over the fresh rolls of thunder. Rain was splattering over Harry's glasses. How on earth was Harry going to see the Snitch in this? ",
        "The Hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite side of the Quidditch field, wearing their scarlet robes. The Captains walked up to each other and shook hands; Cedric Diggory smiled at Wood but Oliver Wood now looked as though Cedric Diggory had lockjaw and merely nodded. Harry saw Madam Hooch's mouth form the words, \"Mount your brooms.\" Cedric Diggory pulled Cedric Diggory out of the mud with a squelch and swung his foot over Cedric Diggory Nimbus Two Thousand. Madam Hooch put Madam Hooch whistle to Madam Hooch lips and gave her whistle a blast that sounded shrill and distant -- they were off. ",
        "Harry rose fast, but Harry Nimbus was swerving slightly with The wind. Harry held his Nimbus as steady as Harry could and turned, squinting into the rain. ",
        "Within five minutes Harry was soaked to Harry skin and frozen, hardly able to see Harry teammates, let alone the Snitch. Harry flew backward and forward across the Quidditch field past blurred red and yellow shapes, with no idea of what was happening in the rest of the game. Harry couldn't hear the commentary over The wind. the crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaks and battered umbrellas. Harry came very close to being unseated by a Bludger; Harry vision was so clouded by the rain on Harry's glasses Harry hadn't seen the crowd coming. ",
        "Harry lost track of time. It was getting harder and harder to hold Harry broom straight. The sky was getting darker, as though night had decided to come early. Twice Harry nearly hit another player, without knowing whether it was a teammate or opponent; everyone was now so wet, and the rain so thick, Harry could hardly tell everyone apart. ... ",
        "With the first flash of lightning came the sound of Madam Hooch whistle; Harry could just see the outline of Oliver Wood through the thick rain, gesturing Harry to the ground. the team splashed down into the mud. ",
        "\"I called for time-out!\" Wood roared at the team. ",
        "\"Come on, under here -- \" ",
        "They huddled at the edge of the Quidditch field under a large umbrella; Harry took off Harry's glasses and wiped They hurriedly on their scarlet robes. ",
        "\"What's the score?\" ",
        "\"We're fifty points up,\" said Wood, \"but unless We get the Snitch the Snitch soon, We'll be playing into the night.\" ",
        "\"I've got no chance with these on,\" Harry said exasperatedly, waving Harry's glasses. ",
        "At that very moment, Hermione appeared at Harry shoulder; Hermione was holding Hermione cloak over Hermione head and was, inexplicably, beaming. ",
        "\"I've had an idea, Harry! Give me your glasses, quick!\" ",
        "Harry handed them to Hermione, and as the team watched in amazement, Hermione tapped them with Hermione wand and said, \"Imperviusl\" ",
        "\"There!\" Hermione said, handing them back to Harry. \"them'll repel water!\" ",
        "Wood looked as though Harry could have kissed Hermione. ",
        "\"Brilliant!\" Harry called hoarsely after Hermione as Hermione disappeared into the crowd. \"Okay, team, let's go for it!\" ",
        "Hermione 's spell had done the trick. Harry was still numb with cold, still wetter than Harry'd ever been in Harry life, but Harry could see. Full of fresh determination, Harry urged his broom through the turbulent air, staring in every direction for the Snitch, avoiding a Bludger, ducking beneath Diggory, who was streaking in the opposite direction. ... ",
        "There was another clap of thunder, followed immediately by forked lightning. This was getting more and more dangerous. Harry needed to get the Snitch quickly -- ",
        "Harry turned, intending to head back toward the middle of the Quidditch field, but at that moment, another flash of lightning illuminated the stands, and Harry saw something that distracted Harry completely -- the silhouette of an enormous shaggy black dog, clearly imprinted against The sky, motionless in the topmost, empty row of seats. ",
        "Harry's numb hands slipped on the broom handle and his Nimbus dropped a few feet. Shaking Harry sodden bangs out of Harry eyes, Harry squinted back into the stands. The dog had vanished. ",
        "\"Harry!\" came Wood's anguished yell from the Gryffindor goal posts. \"Harry, behind you!\" ",
        "Harry looked wildly around. Cedric Diggory was pelting up the Quidditch field, and a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the rain-filled air between them -- ",
        "With a jolt of panic, Harry threw Harry flat to the broom-handle and zoomed toward the Snitch. ",
        "\"Come on!\" Harry growled at his Nimbus his Nimbus as the rain whipped Harry face. \"Fasteri\" ",
        "But something odd was happening. An eerie silence was falling across the stadium. The wind, though as strong as ever, was forgetting to roar. It was as though someone had turned off the sound, as though Harry had gone suddenly deaf -- what was going on? ",
        "And then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over Harry, inside Harry, just as Harry became aware of something moving on the Quidditch field below. . . . ",
        "Before Harry'd had time to think, Harry had taken his eyes off the Snitch and looked down. ",
        "At least a hundred dementors, their hidden faces pointing up at Harry, were standing beneath Harry. It was as though freezing water were rising in Harry chest, cutting at Harry insides. And then Harry heard it again. ... Someone was screaming, screaming inside Someone head ... a woman . . . ",
        "\"Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry\\\" ",
        "\" Stand aside, you silly girl ... stand aside, now. ...\" ",
        "\" Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead -- \" ",
        "Numbing, swirling white mist was filling Harry's brain. . . . What was Harry doing? Why was Harry flying? Harry needed to help you silly girl. ... you silly girl was going to die. ... you silly girl was going to be murdered. ... ",
        "Harry was falling, falling through white mist. ",
        "\"Not Harry\\ Please ... have mercy ... have mercy. ...\" ",
        "A shrill voice was laughing, you silly girl was screaming, and Harry knew no more. ",
        "\"Lucky the ground was so soft.\" ",
        "\"I thought Harry was dead for sure.\" ",
        "\"But Harry didn't even break Harry glasses.\" ",
        "Harry could hear the voices whispering, but the voices made no sense whatsoever. Harry didn't have a clue where Harry was, or how Harry'd got there, or what Harry'd been doing before Harry got there. All Harry knew was that every inch of Harry was aching as though every inch of him had been beaten. ",
        "\"That was the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life.\" ",
        "Scariest . . . the scariest thing . . . hooded black figures ... cold ... screaming ... ",
        "Harry's eyes snapped open. Harry was lying in the hospital wing. The Gryffindor Quidditch team, spattered with mud from head to foot, was gathered around Harry bed. Ron and Hermione were also there, ",
        "looking as though Ron and Hermione'd just climbed out of a swimming pool. ",
        "\"Harry!\" said Fred, who looked extremely white underneath the mud. \"How're you feeling?\" ",
        "It was as though Harry's memory was on fast forward. The lightning -- the Grim -- the Snitch -- and the dementors ... ",
        "\"What happened?\" he said, sitting up so suddenly they all gasped. ",
        "\"You fell off,\" said Fred. \"Must've been -- what -- fifty feet?\" ",
        "\"they all thought you'd died,\" said Alicia, who was shaking. ",
        "Hermione made a small, squeaky noise. Harry's eyes were extremely bloodshot. ",
        "\"But the match,\" said Harry. \"What happened? Are they all doing a replay?\" ",
        "No one said anything. The horrible truth sank into Harry like a stone. ",
        "\"We didn't -- lose?\" ",
        "\"Diggory got the Snitch,\" said George. \"Just after you fell. George didn't realize what had happened. When George looked back and saw you on the ground, George tried to call it off. Wanted a rematch. But they won fair and square ... \" ",
        "Wood admits it.\" ",
        "\"Where is \" ",
        "Wood?\" said Harry, suddenly realizing Harry wasn't there. ",
        "\"Still in the showers,\" said Fred. \"We think George's trying to drown George.\" ",
        "Harry put Harry face to Harry knees, Harry hands gripping Harry hair. Fred grabbed Fred and shook his shoulder roughly. ",
        "\"C'mon, Harry, you've never missed the Snitch the Snitch before.\" ",
        "\"There had to be one time you didn't get it,\" said George. ",
        "\"It's not over yet,\" said Fred. \"We lost by a hundred points, right? So if Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and We beat Ravenclaw and Slytherin ...\" ",
        "\"Hufflepuff'll have to lose by at least two hundred points,\" said George. ",
        "\"But if they beat Ravenclaw ...\" ",
        "\"No way, Ravenclaw is too good. But if Slytherin loses against Hufflepuff ...\" ",
        "\"It all depends on the points -- a margin of a hundred either way -- \" ",
        "Harry lay there, not saying a word. they had lost ... for the first time ever, Harry had lost a Quidditch match. ",
        "After ten minutes or so, Madam Pomfrey came over to tell the team to leave Madam Pomfrey in peace. ",
        "\"Well come and see you later,\" Fred told Madam Pomfrey. \"Don't beat Fred up, Harry, you're still the best Seeker we've ever had.\" ",

    "THE MARAUDER'S MAP": [
        "It was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and grounds. But the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around the truly remarkable thing, each labeled with a name in minuscule writing. Astounded, Harry bent over it. A labeled dot in the top left corner showed that \"Dumbledore \"Dumbledore was pacing \"Dumbledore study; the caretaker's cat, Mrs. Norris, was prowling the second floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy room. And as Harry's eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors, \"Dumbledore noticed something else. ",
        "a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and grounds showed a set of passages \"Dumbledore had never entered. And many of them seemed to lead -- ",
        "\"Right into Hogsmeade,\" said Fred, tracing one of them with \"Dumbledore finger. \"There are seven in all. Now, Filch knows about these four\" -- Filch pointed them out -- \"but them're sure them're the only ones who know about these. Don't bother with the one behind the mirror on the second floor. them used the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor until last winter, but the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor's caved in -- completely blocked. And them don't reckon anyone's ever used this one, because the Whomping Willow's planted right over the entrance. But this one, this one leads right into the cellar of Honeydukes. them've used this one loads of times. And as you might've noticed, the entrance is right outside the trophy room, through that one-eyed old crone's hump.\" ",
        "\"Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs,\" sighed George, patting the heading of the map. \"them owe them so much.\" ",
        "\"Noble men, working tirelessly to help a new generation of law-breakers,\" said Fred. ",
        "\"Right,\" said George briskly. \"Don't forget to wipe it after you've used it -- \" ",
        "\" -- or anyone can read it,Fred Fred said warningly. ",
        "\"Just tap it again and say, 'Mischief managed!' And it'll go blank.\" ",
        "\"So, young Harry,\" said Fred, in an uncanny impersonation of Percy, \"mind you behave yourself.\" ",
        "\"See you in Honeydukes,\" said George, winking. ",
        "both left the trophy room, both smirking in a satisfied sort of way. ",
        "Harry stood there, gazing at the map. Harry watched the tiny ink Mrs. Norris turn left and pause to sniff at something on the second floor. If Filch really didn't know ... Filch wouldn't have to pass the dementors at all. ... ",
        "But even as Filch stood there, flooded with excitement, something Harry had once heard Mr. Weasley say came floating out of Mr. Weasley memory. ",
        "Never trust anything that can think for itself, if you can't see where itself keeps itself brain. ",
        "the map was one of those dangerous magical objects Mr. Weasley had been warning against. ... Aids for Magical Mischief-Makers . . . but then, Harry reasoned, Harry only wanted to use the map to get into Hogsmeade, the map wasn't as though Harry wanted to steal anything or attack anyone ... and Fred and George George had been using the map for years without anything horrible happening. ... ",
        "Harry traced the secret passage to Honeydukes with Harry finger. ",
        "Then, quite suddenly, as though following orders, Harry rolled up the map, stuffed the map inside Harry robes, and hurried to the door of the classroom. Harry opened the map a couple of inches. There was no one outside. Very carefully, Harry edged out of the trophy room and behind the statue of the one-eyed witch. ",
        "What did Harry have to do? Harry pulled out the map again and saw, to Harry astonishment, that a new ink figure had appeared upon a new ink figure, labeled Harry Potter. a new ink figure was standing exactly where Harry Harry was standing, about halfway down the third-floor corridor. Harry watched carefully. Harry little ink self appeared to be tapping the one-eyed witch with His little ink self . Harry quickly took out his wand and tapped the one-eyed statue. Nothing happened. Harry looked back at the map. The tiniest speech bubble had appeared next to a new ink figure. The word inside said, \" Dissendium.\" ",
        "\" Dissendiurrd\" Harry whispered, tapping the one-eyed witch again. ",
        "At once, the one-eyed statue's hump opened wide enough to admit a fairly thin person. Harry glanced quickly up and down the third-floor corridor, then tucked the map away again, hoisted Harry into the hole headfirst, and pushed Harry forward. ",
        "Harry slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide, then landed on cold, damp earth. Harry stood up, looking around. It was pitch dark. Harry held up his wand, muttered, \"Lumos\\\" and saw that Harry was in a very narrow, low, earthy passageway. Harry raised the map, tapped he was in a very narrow, low, earthy passageway with the tip of his wand, and muttered, \"Mischief managed!\" the map went blank at once. Harry folded the map carefully, tucked the map inside his robes, then, heart beating fast, both excited and apprehensive, Harry set off. ",
        "the secret passage twisted and turned, more like the burrow of a giant rabbit than anything else. Harry hurried along the map, stumbling now and then on the uneven floor, holding his wand out in front of Harry. ",
        "It took ages, but Harry had the thought of Honeydukes to sustain Harry. After what felt like an hour, the secret passage began to rise. Panting, Harry sped up, Harry face hot, Harry feet very cold. ",
        "Ten minutes later, Harry came to the foot of some worn stone steps, which rose out of sight above Harry. ",
        "Careful not to make any noise, Harry began to climb. A hundred steps, two hundred steps, Harry lost count as Harry climbed, watching his feet. ... Then, without warning, Harry head hit something hard. ",
        "It seemed to be a trapdoor. Harry stood there, massaging the top of his head, listening. Harry couldn't hear any sounds above Harry. Very slowly, Harry pushed a trapdoor open and peered over the edge. ",
        "Harry was in a cellar, which was full of wooden crates and boxes. Harry climbed out of a trapdoor and replaced a trapdoor -- a trapdoor blended so perfectly with the dusty floor that a trapdoor was impossible to tell it was there. Harry crept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led upstairs. Now Harry could definitely hear voices, not to mention the tinkle of a bell and the opening and shutting of a door. ",
        "Wondering what Harry ought to do, Harry suddenly heard a door open much closer at hand; somebody was about to come downstairs. ",
        "\"And get another box of Jelly Slugs, dear, they've nearly cleaned us out -- \" said a woman's voice. ",
        "A pair of feet was coming down the wooden staircase that led upstairs. Harry leapt behind an enormous crate and waited for the footsteps to pass. Harry heard Harry shifting boxes against the opposite wall. Harry might not get another chance -- ",
        "Quickly and silently, Harry dodged out from Harry hiding place and climbed the stairs; looking back, Harry saw an enormous backside and shiny bald head, buried in a box. Harry reached a door at the top of the stairs, slipped through a door, and found Harry behind the counter of Honeydukes -- Harry ducked, crept sideways, and then straightened up. ",
        "Honeydukes was so crowded with Hogwarts students that no one looked twice at Harry. Harry edged among them, looking around, and suppressed a laugh as Harry imagined the look that would spread over Dudley's piggy face if Harry could see where Harry was now. ",
        "There were shelves upon shelves of the most succulent-looking sweets imaginable. Creamy chunks of nougat, shimmering pink squares of coconut ice, fat, honey-colored toffees; hundreds of different kinds of chocolate in neat rows; there was a large barrel of Every Flavor Beans, and another of Fizzing Whizbees, the levitating sherbert balls that Ron had mentioned; along yet another wall were \"Special Effects\" sweets: Drooble's Best Blowing Gum (which filled a room with bluebell-colored bubbles that refused to pop for days), the strange, splintery Toothflossing Stringmints, tiny black Pepper Imps (\"breathe fire for your friends!\"), ",
        "Ice Mice (\"hear your teeth chatter and squeak!\"), peppermint creams shaped like toads (\"hop realistically in the stomach!\"), fragile sugar-spun quills, and exploding bonbons. ",

        "the shop (UNUSUAL TASTES). Ron and Hermione were standing underneath a sign hanging in the farthest corner of ",
        "the shop (UNUSUAL TASTES), examining a tray of blood-flavored lollipops. Harry sneaked up behind Ron and Hermione. ",

        "\"How about these?\" said Ron, shoving ajar of Cockroach Clusters under Hermione 's nose. ",
        "\"Definitely not,\" said Harry. ",

        "\"Wow!\" said Ron, looking very impressed, \"you've learned to Apparate!\" ",
        "\" 'Course I haven't,\" said Harry. Harry dropped Harry voice so that none of the sixth years could hear Harry and told them all about the Marauder's Map. ",
        "\"How come Fred and George George never gave it to me!\" said Ron, outraged. \"I'm Fred and George brother!\" ",
        "\"But Harry isn't going to keep it!\" said Hermione, as though the idea were ludicrous. \"Harry's going to hand it in to Professor McGonagall, aren't you, Harry?\" ",
        "\"No, I'm not!\" said Harry. ",
        "\"Are you mad?\" said Ron, goggling at Hermione. ",
        "\"Hand in something that good?\" ",
        "\"If I hand it in, I'll have to say where I got it! Filch would know Fred and George George had nicked it!\" ",
        "\"But what about Sirius Black?\" Hermione hissed. \"Harry could be using one of the passages on that map to get into the castle! The teachers have got to know!\" ",
        "\"Harry can't be getting in through a passage,\" said Harry quickly. \"There are seven secret tunnels on the map, right? Fred and George George reckon Filch already knows about four of Fred and George. And of the other three -- one of Fred and George caved in, so no one can get through it. One of Fred and George's got the Whomping Willow planted over the entrance, so you can't get out of the Whomping Willow. And the one I just came through -- well -- it's really hard to see the entrance to the Whomping Willow down in the cellar, so unless Harry knew it was there ...\" ",

        "Harry hands were freezing, so they crossed the road, and in a few minutes were entering the tiny inn. ",

        "\"That's Madam Rosmerta,\" said Ron. \"I'll get the drinks, shall I?\" Ron added, going slightly red. ",
        "Ron and Hermione Hermione made Ron and Hermione way to the back of the room, where there was a small, vacant table between the window and a handsome Christmas tree, which stood next to the fireplace. Ron came back five minutes later, carrying three foaming tankards of hot butterbeer. ",
        "\"Merry Christmas!\" Ron said happily, raising Ron tankard. ",
        "Harry drank deeply. It was the most delicious thing Harry'd ever tasted and seemed to heat every bit of Harry from the inside. ",
        "A sudden breeze ruffled Harry hair. The door of the Three Broomsticks had opened again. Harry looked over the rim of his tankard and choked. ",
        "Professors McGonagall and Flitwick had just entered the pub with a flurry of snowflakes, shortly followed by Hagrid, who was deep in conversation with a portly man in a lime-green bowler hat and a pinstriped cloak -- Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic. ",
        "In an instant, Ron and Hermione had Ron and Hermione placed hands on the top of Harry's head and forced the top of Harry's head off the top of Harry's head stool and under the table. Dripping with butterbeer and crouching out of sight, Harry clutched Harry empty tankard and watched the teachers' and Fudge's feet move toward the bar, pause, then turn and walk right toward the top of Harry's head.

        "Somewhere above the top of Harry's head, Hermione whispered, \"Mobiliarbus\\\" ",
        "The Christmas tree beside the teachers' table rose a few inches off the ground, drifted sideways, and landed with a soft thump right in front of their table, hiding the teachers' from view. Staring through the dense lower branches, Harry saw four sets of chair legs move back from their table right beside the teachers', then heard the grunts and sighs of the teachers and Minister as the teachers and minister sat down.

        "Next Harry saw another pair of feet, wearing sparkly turquoise high heels, and heard a woman's voice. ",
        "\"A small gillywater -- \" ",

        "\"Well, thank you very much, Minister.\" ",
        "Harry watched the glittering heels march away and back again. Harry heart was pounding uncomfortably in his throat. Why hadn't it occurred to Harry that this was the last weekend of term for the teachers too? And how long were the teachers going to sit there? Harry needed time to sneak back into Honeydukes if Harry wanted to return to school tonight. ... Hermione's leg gave a nervous twitch next to Harry. ",
        "\"So, what brings you to this neck of the woods, Minister?\" came Madam Rosmerta's voice. ",
        "Harry saw the lower part of Fudge's thick body twist in Harry chair as though Harry were checking for eavesdroppers. Then Harry said in a quiet voice, \"What else, m'dear, but Sirius Black? I daresay you heard what happened up at the school at Halloween?\" ",
        "\"I did hear a rumor,\" admitted Madam Rosmerta. ",
        "\"Did you tell the whole pub, Hagrid?\" said Professor McGonagall exasperatedly. ",

        "\"I'm sure of it,\" said Fudge shortly. ",
        "\"You know that the dementors have searched the whole village twice?\" said Madam Rosmerta, a slight edge to Madam Rosmerta voice. \"Scared all my customers away. ... It's very bad for business, Minister.\" ",
        "\"Rosmerta, m'dear, I don't like business, Minister any more than you do,\" said Fudge uncomfortably. \"Necessary precaution ... unfortunate, but there you are. ... I've just met some of business, Minister. business, Minister're in a fury against Dumbledore -- Dumbledore won't let business, Minister inside the castle grounds.\" ",
        "\"I should think not,\" said Professor McGonagall sharply. \"How are we supposed to teach with those horrors floating around?\" ",
        "\"Hear, hear!\" squeaked tiny Professor Flitwick, whose feet were dangling a foot from the ground. ",
        "\"All the same,\" demurred Fudge, \"they are here to protect you all from something much worse. ... We all know what Black's capable of. ...\" ",
        "\"Do you know, I still have trouble believing it,\" said Madam Rosmerta thoughtfully. \"Of all the people to go over to the Dark Side, Sirius Black was the last I'd have thought ... I mean, I remember Madam Rosmerta when Madam Rosmerta was a boy at Hogwarts. If you'd told me then what Madam Rosmerta was going to become, I'd have said you'd had too much mead.\" ",
        "\"You don't know the half of too much mead, Rosmerta,\" said Fudge gruffly. \"The worst Madam Rosmerta did isn't widely known.\" ",
        "\"The worst?\" said Madam Rosmerta, Madam Rosmerta voice alive with curiosity. \"Worse than murdering all those poor people, you mean?\" ",
        "\"I certainly do,\" said Fudge. ",
        "\"I can't believe that. What could possibly be worse?\" ",
        "\"You say you remember Madam Rosmerta at Hogwarts, Rosmerta,\" murmured Professor McGonagall. \"Do you remember who Madam Rosmerta best friend was?\" ",
        "\"Naturally,\" said Madam Rosmerta, with a small laugh. \"Never saw one without the other, did you? The number of times I had the other in here -- ooh, the other used to make me laugh. Quite the double act, Sirius Black and James Potter!\" ",
        "Harry dropped Harry tankard with a loud clunk. Ron kicked Harry. ",
        "\"Precisely,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Sirius Black. Ringleaders of their little gang. Both very bright, of course -- exceptionally bright, in fact -- but I don't think we've ever had such a pair of troublemakers -- \" ",
        "\"I dunno,\" chuckled Hagrid. \"Fred and George Weasley could give Fred and George Weasley a run fer Fred and George Weasley money.\" ",
        "\"You'd have thought Sirius Black were brothers!\" chimed in Professor Flitwick. \"Inseparable!\" ",
        "\"Of course Sirius Black were,\" said Fudge. \"Potter trusted Sirius Black beyond all Potter other friends. Nothing changed when Sirius Black left school. Sirius Black was best man when ",
        "James married Lily. Then Sirius Black named best man when ",
        "James married Lily godfather to Harry. Harry has no idea, of course. You can imagine how no idea would torment Harry.\" ",
        "\"Because Sirius Black turned out to be in league with You- Know-Who?\" whispered Madam Rosmerta. ",
        "\"Worse even than that, m'dear. ...\" Fudge dropped Fudge voice and proceeded in a sort of low rumble. \"Not many people are aware that the Potters knew You- Know-Who was after Not many people. Dumbledore, who was of course working tirelessly against You-Know-Who, had a number of useful spies. One of Dumbledore, who was of course working tirelessly against You-Know-Who tipped him off, and him alerted James and Lily at once. him advised James and Lily to go into hiding. Well, of course, You-Know- Who wasn't an easy person to hide from. Dumbledore told James and Lily that James and Lily best chance was the Fidelius Charm.\" ",
        "\"How does that work?\" said Madam Rosmerta, breathless with interest. Professor Flitwick cleared Professor Flitwick . ",
        "\"An immensely complex spell,\" Professor Flitwick said squeakily, \"involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single, living soul. The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find -- unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge The information. As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find Lily and James, not even if the Secret-Keeper had the Secret-Keeper nose pressed against Lily and James sitting room window!\" ",
        "\"So Sirius Black was the Potters' Secret-Keeper?\" whispered Madam Rosmerta. ",
        "\"Naturally,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"James Potter told Dumbledore that Sirius Black would die rather than tell ",
        "where Sirius Black were, that Sirius Black was planning to go into hiding the Potters' Secret-Keeper . . . and yet, Dumbledore remained worried. I remember Dumbledore offering to be the Potters' Secret-Keeper himself.\" ",
        "\"Dumbledore suspected Sirius Black?\" gasped Madam Rosmerta. ",
        "\"Dumbledore was sure that somebody close to the Potters had been keeping You-Know-Who informed of their movements,\" said Professor Professor McGonagall darkly. \"Indeed, Dumbledore had suspected for some time that someone on our side had turned traitor and was passing a lot of information to You-Know-Who.\" ",
        "\"But James Potter insisted on using Black?\" ",
        "\"Dumbledore did,\" said Fudge heavily. \"And then, barely a week after the Fidelius Charm had been performed -- \" ",
        "\"Black betrayed them?\" breathed Madam Rosmerta. ",
        "\"Dumbledore did indeed. Sirius Black was tired of Dumbledore double-agent role, Dumbledore was ready to declare Dumbledore support openly for You-Know-Who, and Dumbledore seems to have planned this for the moment of the Potters' death. But, as we all know, You-Know-Who met Dumbledore downfall in James PotterJames Potter. Powers gone, horribly weakened, Dumbledore fled. And this left Sirius Black in a very nasty position indeed. Dumbledore master had fallen at the very moment when Dumbledore, Black, had shown His master true colors as a traitor. His master had no choice but to run for it -- \" ",
        "\"Filthy, stinkin' turncoat!\" Hagrid said, so loudly that half the bar went quiet. ",
        "\"Shh!\" said Professor McGonagall. ",
        "\"I met Professor McGonagall!\" growled Hagrid. \"I musta bin the last ter see bin before bin killed all them people! It was me ",

But I'd had me orders from Dumbledore, an' I told Black no, Dumbledore said Harry was ter go ter Harry aunt an' uncle's. Sirius Black argued, but in the end Sirius Black gave in. Told me ter take Sirius Black motorbike ter get Harry there. 'I won't need it anymore,' Harry says. ",
        "\"I shoulda known there was somethin' fishy goin' on then. Harry loved that motorbike, what was Harry givin' it ter me for? Why wouldn' Harry need it anymore? Fact was, it was too easy ter trace. Dumbledore knew Dumbledore'd bin the Potters' Secret-Keeper.

        "\"But what if I'd given Harry to Harry, eh? I bet Harry 'd've pitched Harry off the bike halfway out ter sea. Harry bes' friends' son! But when a wizard goes over ter the Dark Side, there's nothin' and no one that matters to 'em anymore. ...\" ",
        "A long silence followed Hagrid 's story. Then Madam Rosmerta said with some satisfaction, \"But Madam Rosmerta didn't manage to disappear, did Madam Rosmerta? The Ministry of Magic caught up with Madam Rosmerta next day!\" ",
        "\"Alas, if only we had,\" said Fudge bitterly. \"It was not we who found Madam Rosmerta. It was little Peter Pettigrew -- another of the Potters' friends. Maddened by grief, no doubt, and knowing that Sirius Black had been the Potters' Secret-Keeper, he went after Sirius Black.\" ",

You know, most of the prisoners in there sit muttering to the prisoners in the dark; there's no sense in the prisoners ... but I was shocked at how normal Sirius Black seemed.

        "\"Merry Christmas!\" said Dumbledore as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached the table. \"As there are so few of us, it seemed foolish to use the House tables. ",
        "... Sit down, sit down!\" ",
        "Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down side by side at the end of the table. ",
        "\"Crackers!\" said Dumbledore enthusiastically, offering the end of a large silver noisemaker to Snape, who took it reluctantly and tugged. With a bang like a gunshot, the cracker flew apart to reveal a large, pointed witch's hat topped with a stuffed vulture. ",
        "Harry, remembering the boggart, caught Ron's eye and they both grinned; Snape 's mouth thinned and ",
        "Ron pushed the hat toward Dumbledore, who swapped it for Ron wizard's hat at once. ",
        "\"Dig in!\" Ron advised the table, beaming around. ",
        "As Harry was helping Ron to roast potatoes, the doors of the Great Hall opened again. It was Professor Trelawney, gliding toward them as though on wheels. Professor Trelawney had put on a green sequined dress in honor of the occasion, making Professor Trelawney look more than ever like a glittering, oversized dragonfly. ",
        "\"Sibyll, this is a pleasant surprise!\" said Dumbledore, standing up. ",
        "\"I have been crystal gazing, Headmaster,\" said Professor Trelawney in Professor Trelawney mistiest, most faraway voice, \"and to my astonishment, I saw Professor Trelawney abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you. Who am I to refuse the promptings of fate? I at once hastened from my tower, and I do beg you to forgive my lateness. ...\" ",
        "\"Certainly, certainly,\" said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. \"Let me draw you up a chair -- \" ",
        "And his did indeed draw a chair in midair with his wand, which revolved for a few seconds before falling with a thud between Professors Snape and McGonagall. Professor Trelawney, however, did not sit down; Professor Trelawney enormous eyes had been roving around the table, and Professor Trelawney suddenly uttered a kind of soft scream. ",
        "\"I dare not, Headmaster! If I join the table, we shall be thirteen! Nothing could be more unlucky! Never forget that when thirteen dine together, the first to rise will be the first to die!\" ",
        "\"Well risk it, Sibyll,\" said Professor McGonagall impatiently. \"Do sit down, the turkey's getting stone cold.Professor Trelawney hesitated, then lowered Professor Trelawney into the empty chair, eyes shut and mouth clenched tight, as though expecting a thunderbolt to hit the table. Professor McGonagall poked a large spoon into the nearest tureen. ",
        "\"Tripe, Sibyll?Professor Trelawney ignored Professor Trelawney. Eyes open again, Professor Trelawney looked around once more and said, \"But where is dear Professor Lupin?\" ",
        "\"I'm afraid the poor fellow is ill again,\" said Dumbledore, indicating that everybody should start serving everybody. \"Most unfortunate that it should happen on Christmas Day.\" ",
        "\"But surely you already knew that, Sibyll?\" said Professor McGonagall, Professor Trelawney eyebrows raised. ",
        "Professor Trelawney gave Professor McGonagall a very cold look. ",
        "\"Certainly I knew, Minerva,\" Professor Trelawney said quietly. \"But one does not parade the fact that one is All-Knowing. ",
        "I frequently act as though I am not possessed of the Inner Eye, so as not to make others nervous.\" ",
        "\"That explains a great deal,\" said Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall tartly. ",
        "Professor Trelawney's voice suddenly became a good deal less misty. ",
        "\"If you must know, Minerva, I have seen that poor Professor Lupin will not be with us for very long. poor Professor Lupin seems aware, poor Professor Lupin, that poor Professor Lupin time is short. poor Professor Lupin positively fled when I offered to crystal gaze for poor Professor Lupin -- ",
        "\"Imagine that,\" said Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall dryly. ",
        "\"I doubt,\" said Dumbledore, in a cheerful but slightly raised voice, which put an end to Professor McGonagall and Professor Trelawney's conversation, \"that poor Professor Lupin is in any immediate danger. Severus, you've made the potion for Severus again?\" ",
        "\"Yes, Headmaster,\" said Snape. ",
        "\"Good,\" said Dumbledore. \"Then Severus should be up and about in no time. ... Derek, have you had any of these chipolatas? They're excellent.\" ",
        "The first-year boy went furiously red on being addressed directly by Dumbledore, and took the platter of sausages with trembling hands. ",
        "Professor Trelawney behaved almost normally until the very end of Christmas dinner, two hours later. ",
        "Full to bursting with Christmas dinner and still wearing their party hats, Harry Ron got up first from the table and she shrieked loudly. ",
        "\"My dears! Which of you left his seat first? Which?\" ",
        "\"Dunno,\" said Ron, looking uneasily at Harry. ",
        "\"I doubt it will make much difference,\" said Professor McGonagall coldly, \"unless a mad axe-man is waiting outside the doors to slaughter the first into the entrance hall.\" ",
        "Ron Ron laughed. Professor Trelawney looked highly affronted. ",
        "\"Coming?\" Harry said to Hermione. ",
        "\"No,\" Hermione muttered, \"I want a quick word with Professor McGonagall.\" ",
        "\"Probably trying to see if Professor Trelawney can take any more classes,\" yawned Ron as they made they way into the entrance hall, which was completely devoid of mad axe-men. ",
        "When they reached the portrait hole, they found Sir Cadogan enjoying a Christmas party with a couple of monks, several previous headmasters of Hogwarts, and Sir Cadogan fat pony. Sir Cadogan pushed up Sir Cadogan visor and toasted they with a flagon of mead. ",
        "\"Merry -- hie -- Christmas! Password?\" ",
        "\"Scurvy cur,\" said Ron. ",
        "\"And the same to you, Sir Cadogan!\" roared Sir Cadogan as the painting swung forward to admit the painting. ",
        "Harry went straight up to the dormitory, collected the Firebolt and the Broomstick Servicing Kit Hermione had given Harry for Harry birthday, brought the Firebolt and the Broomstick Servicing Kit Hermione downstairs, and tried to find something to do to the Firebolt; however, there were no bent twigs to clip, and the handle was so shiny already it seemed pointless to polish it. Harry Ron simply sat admiring it from every angle until the portrait hole opened, and Hermione came in, accompanied by Professor McGonagall. ",
        "Though Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, Harry had seen Professor McGonagall in the common room only ",
        "once before, and that had been to make a very grave announcement. Harry Ron stared at Professor McGonagall, Harry, Ron, and Hermione holding the Firebolt. Hermione walked around Harry, Ron, and Hermione, sat down, picked up the nearest book, and hid Professor McGonagall face behind the nearest book. ",
        "\"So that's it, is it?\" said Professor McGonagall beadily, walking over to the fireside and staring at the Firebolt. \"Miss Granger has just informed me that you have been sent a broomstick, Potter.\" ",
        "Harry and Ron looked around at Hermione. \" ",
        "Harry and Ron could see Hermione forehead reddening over the top of Hermione book, which was upside down. ",
        "\"May I?\" said Professor McGonagall, but Professor McGonagall didn't wait for an answer before pulling the Firebolt out of \" ",
        "Harry and Ron hands. Professor McGonagall examined it carefully from handle to twig-ends. \"Hmm. And there was no note at all, ",
        "Potter? No card? No message of any kind?\" ",
        "\"No,\" said Harry blankly. ",
        "\"I see ... ,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Well, I'm afraid I will have to take this, Potter.\" ",
        "\"W -- what?\" said Harry, scrambling to Harry feet. \"Why?\" ",
        "\"It will need to be checked for jinxes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Of course, I'm no expert, but I daresay Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick will strip it down -- \" ",
        "\"Strip it down?\" repeated Ron, as though Professor McGonagall was mad. ",
        "\"It shouldn't take more than a few weeks,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"You will have it back if we are sure it is jinx-free.\" ",
        "\"There's nothing wrong with it!\" said Harry, Harry voice shaking slightly. \"Honestly, Professor -- \" ",
        "\"You can't know that, Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall, quite kindly, \"not until you've flown it, at any rate, and I'm afraid that is out of the question until we are certain that it has not been tampered with. I shall keep you informed.\" ",
        "Professor McGonagall turned on Professor McGonagall heel and carried the Firebolt out of the portrait hole, which closed behind Professor McGonagall. Harry stood staring after Professor McGonagall, the tin of High-Finish Polish still clutched in Professor McGonagall hands. Ron, however, rounded on Hermione. ",
        "\"What did you go running to Professor McGonagall for?Hermione threw the nearest book aside. Hermione was still pink in the face, but stood up and faced Ron defiantly. ",
        "\"Because I thought -- and Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall agrees with me -- that that broom was probably sent to Harry by Sirius Black!\" ",
        "Harry Harry knew that Hermione had meant well, but that didn't stop Harry from being angry with Hermione. Harry had been the owner of the best broom in the world for a few short hours, and now, because of Hermione interference, Harry didn't know whether Harry would ever see it again. Harry was positive that there was nothing wrong with the Firebolt now, but what sort of state would it be in once it had been subjected to all sorts of anti-jinx tests? ",
        "Ron was furious with Hermione too. As far as Ron was concerned, the stripping-down of a brand-new Firebolt was nothing less than criminal damage. Hermione, who remained convinced that she had acted for the best, started avoiding the common room. Harry, Ron, and Hermione Ron supposed she had taken refuge in the library and didn't try to persuade she to come back. All in all, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were glad when the rest of the school returned shortly after New Year, and Gryffindor Tower became crowded and noisy again. ",
        "Wood sought Harry out on the night before term started. ",
        "\"Had a good Christmas?\" he said, and then, without waiting for an answer, he sat down, lowered he voice, and said, \"I've been doing some thinking over Christmas, Harry. After the last match, you know. If the dementors come to the next one ... I mean . . . we can't afford you to -- well -- \" ",
        "Wood broke off, looking awkward. ",
        "\"I'm working on it,\" said Harry quickly. \"poor Professor Lupin said poor Professor Lupin'd train me to ward off the dementors. we should be starting this week. poor Professor Lupin said poor Professor Lupin'd have time after Christmas.\" ",
        "\"Ah,\" said Wood, poor Professor Lupin expression clearing. \"Well, in that case -- I really didn't want to lose you as Seeker, Harry. And have you ordered a new broom yet?\" ",
        "\"No,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"What! You'd better get a move on, you know -- you can't ride that Shooting Star against Ravenclaw!\" ",
        "\"poor Professor Lupin got a Firebolt for Christmas,\" said Ron. ",
        "\"A Firebolt? No! Seriously? A -- a real Firebolt?\" ",
        "\"Don't get excited, Oliver,\" said Harry gloomily. \"I haven't got it anymore. it was confiscated.\" And poor Professor Lupin explained all about how the Firebolt was now being checked for jinxes. ",
        "\"Jinxed? How could it be jinxed?\" ",
        "\"Sirius Black,Harry said wearily. \"Harry's supposed to be after Harry. So Professor McGonagall reckons Harry might have sent Professor McGonagall.\" ",
        "Waving aside the information that a famous murderer was after a famous murderer Seeker, Wood said, \"But Black couldn't have bought a Firebolt! Harry's on the run! The whole country's on the lookout for Harry! How could Harry just walk into Quality Quidditch Supplies and buy a broomstick?\" ",
        "\"I know,\" said Harry, \"but Professor McGonagall still wants to strip it down -- \" ",
        "Wood went pale. ",
        "\"I'll go and talk to Harry, Harry,\" Harry promised. \"I'll make Harry see reason. ... A Firebolt ... a real Firebolt, on our team . . . Harry wants Gryffindor to win as much as our do. ... I'll make Harry see sense. A Firebolt ...\" ",
        "Classes started again the next day. The last thing anyone felt like doing was spending two hours on the grounds on a raw January morning, but Hagrid had provided a bonfire full of salamanders for Hagrid enjoyment, and Hagrid spent an unusually good lesson collecting dry wood and leaves to keep the fire blazing while the flame-loving lizards scampered up and down the crumbling, white-hot logs. The first Divination lesson of the new term was much less fun; Professor Trelawney was now teaching Hagrid palmistry, and Professor Trelawney lost no time in informing Harry that Harry had the shortest life line Professor Trelawney had ever seen. ",
        "It was Defense Against the Dark Arts that Harry was keen to get to; after Harry conversation with Wood, Harry wanted to get started on Harry anti-dementor lessons as soon as possible. ",
        "\"Ah yes,\" said Lupin, when Harry reminded Harry of Harry promise at the end of class. \"Let me see ... how about eight o'clock on Thursday evening? The History of Magic classroom should be large enough. ... I'll have to think carefully about how we're going to do this. ... we can't bring a real dementor into the castle to practice on. ...\" ",
        "\"Still looks ill, doesn't Harry?\" said Ron as they walked down the corridor, heading to dinner. \"What d'you reckon 's the matter with d'you?\" ",
        "There was a loud and impatient \"tuh\" from behind they. It was Hermione, who had been sitting at the feet of a suit of armor, repacking her bag, which was so full of books it wouldn't close. ",
        "\"And what are you tutting at we for?\" said Ron irritably. ",
        "\"Nothing,\" said Hermione in a lofty voice, heaving Hermione bag back over Hermione shoulder. ",
        "\"Yes, you were,\" said Ron. \"I said I wonder what's wrong with poor Professor Lupin, and you -- \" ",
        "\"Well, isn't it obvious?\" said Hermione, with a look of maddening superiority. ",
        "\"If you don't want to tell we, don't,\" snapped Ron. ",
        "\"Fine,\" said Hermione haughtily, and \"Fine marched off. ",
        "\"\"Fine doesn't know,\" said Ron, staring resentfully after Hermione. \"\"Fine's just trying to get we to talk to \"Fine again.\" ",
        "At eight o'clock on Thursday evening, Harry left Gryffindor Tower for the History of Magic classroom. ",
        "It was dark and empty when Harry arrived, but Harry lit the lamps with Harry wand and had waited only five minutes when poor Professor Lupin turned up, carrying a large packing case, which poor Professor Lupin heaved onto Professor Binns' desk. ",
        "\"What's that?\" said Harry. ",
        "\"Another boggart,\" said poor Professor Lupin, stripping off Harry cloak. \"I've been combing the castle ever since Tuesday, and very luckily, I found this one lurking inside Mr. Filch's filing cabinet. It's the nearest we'll get to a real dementor. \"Another boggart will turn into a dementor when \"Another boggart sees you, so we'll be able to practice on \"Another boggart. I can store \"Another boggart in my office when we're not using \"Another boggart; there's a cupboard under my desk \"Another boggart'll like.\" ",
        "\"Okay,\" said Harry, trying to sound as though \"Another boggart wasn't apprehensive at all and merely glad that poor Professor Lupin had found such a good substitute for a real dementor. ",
        "\"So ...\" poor Professor Lupin had taken out his wand, and indicated that Harry should do the same. \"The spell I am going to try and teach you is highly advanced magic, Harry -- well beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level. It is called the Patronus Charm.\" ",
        "\"How does It work?\" said Harry nervously. ",
        "\"Well, when It works correctly, It conjures up a Patronus,\" said Lupin, \"which is a kind of anti- dementor -- a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the dementor.\" ",
        "Harry had a sudden vision of Harry crouching behind a Hagrid-sized figure holding a large club. poor Professor Lupin continued, \"The Patronus is a kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds upon -- hope, happiness, the desire  ",
        "to survive -- but it cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the dementors can't hurt the dementors. But I must warn you, Harry, that the charm might be too advanced for Harry. Many qualified wizards have difficulty with the dementors.\" ",
        "\"What does a Patronus look like?\" said Harry curiously. ",
        "\"Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.\" \"And how do you conjure it?\" ",
        "\"With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating, with all your might, on a single, very happy memory.\" ",
        "Harry cast Harry mind about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing that had happened to Harry at the Dursleys' was going to do. Finally, Harry settled on the moment when Harry had first ridden a broomstick. ",
        "\"Right,\" Harry said, trying to recall as exactly as possible the wonderful, soaring sensation of Harry stomach. ",
        "\"The incantation is this -- \" poor Professor Lupin cleared \" Lupin throat. \"Expecto patronum).\" ",
        "\"Expecto patronum,\" Harry repeated under Harry breath, \"expecto patronum.\" ",
        "\"Concentrating hard on your happy memory?\" ",
        "\"Oh -- yeah -- \" said Harry, quickly forcing Harry thoughts back to that first broom ride. \"Expecto patrono -- no, patronum -- sorry -- expecto patronum, expecto patronum -- \" ",
        "Something whooshed suddenly out of the end of his wand; it looked like a wisp of silvery gas. ",
        "\"Did you see that?\" said Harry excitedly. \"Something happened!\" ",
        "\"Very good,\" said poor Professor Lupin, smiling. \"Right, then -- ready to try it on a dementor?\" ",
        "\"Yes,\" Harry said, gripping his wand very tightly, and moving into the middle of the deserted classroom. Harry tried to keep Harry mind on flying, but something else kept intruding. . . . Any second now, Harry might hear Harry mother again . . . but Harry shouldn't think that, or Harry would hear his mother again, and Harry didn't want to ... or did Harry? ",
        "poor Professor Lupin grasped the lid of the packing case and pulled. ",
        "A dementor rose slowly from the box, A dementor hooded face turned toward Harry, one glistening, scabbed hand gripping A dementor cloak. The lamps around the classroom flickered and went out. A dementor stepped from the box and started to sweep silently toward Harry, drawing a deep, rattling breath. A wave of piercing cold broke over Harry -- ",
        "\"Expecto patronurrdHarry Harry yelled. \"Expecto patronum). Expecto -- \" ",
        "But the classroom and A dementor were dissolving. ",

        "\"Stand aside. Stand aside, girl\\\" ",
        "\"Harry!\" ",
        "Harry jerked back to life. Harry was lying flat on Harry back on the floor. The lamps around the classroom were alight again. Harry didn't have to ask what had happened. ",
        "\"Sorry,\" Harry muttered, sitting up and feeling cold sweat trickling down behind Harry glasses. ",
        "\"Are you all right?\" said poor Professor Lupin. ",
        "\"Yes ...Harry Harry pulled Harry up on one of the desks and leaned against one of the desks. ",
        "\"Here -- \" Lupin handed Harry a Chocolate Frog. \"Eat this before we try again. I didn't expect you to do this your first time; in fact, I would have been astounded if you had.\" ",
        "\"It's getting worse,Harry Harry muttered, biting off a Chocolate Frog. \"I could hear Harry louder that time -- and Harry -- Voldemort -- \" ",

        "\"I do!\" said Harry fiercely, stuffing the rest of a Chocolate Frog into Harry mouth. \"I've got to! What if the dementors turn up at our match against Ravenclaw? I can't afford to fall off again. If our lose this game our've lost the Quidditch Cup!\" ",
        "\"All right then ... ,\" said poor Professor Lupin. \"You might want to select another memory, a happy memory, I mean, to concentrate on. ... That one doesn't seem to have been strong enough. ...\" ",
        "Harry thought hard and decided Harry feelings when Gryffindor had won the House Championship last ",
        "year had definitely qualified as very happy. Harry gripped his wand tightly again and took up Harry position in the middle of the classroom. ",
        "\"Ready?\" said poor Professor Lupin, gripping the box lid. ",
        "\"Ready,\" said Harry, trying hard to fill Harry head with happy thoughts about Gryffindor winning, and not dark thoughts about what was going to happen when the box opened. ",
        "\"Go!\" said poor Professor Lupin, pulling off the box lid. The room went icily cold and dark once more. A dementor glided forward, drawing A dementor breath; one rotting hand was extending toward Harry -- ",

Concentrating very hard on how Harry had felt when Harry'd realized Harry'd be leaving Privet Drive, Harry got to Harry feet and faced the packing case once more. ",
        "\"Ready?\" said Lupin, who looked as though Harry were doing this against Harry better judgment. ",

According to Wood, this was good news for Gryffindor, who would take second place if they beat Ravenclaw too. Ravenclaw therefore increased the number of team practices to five a week. This meant that with Lupin's anti- dementor classes, which in themselves were more draining than six Quidditch practices, Harry had just one night a week to do all Ravenclaw homework. Even so, Ravenclaw wasn't showing the strain nearly as much as Hermione, whose immense workload finally seemed to be getting to Harry. Every night, without fail, Hermione was to be seen in a corner of the common room, several tables spread with books, Arithmancy charts, rune dictionaries, diagrams of Muggles lifting heavy objects, and file upon file of extensive notes; Hermione barely spoke to anybody and snapped when Hermione was interrupted.

        "\"How's Hermione doing it?\" Ron muttered to Harry one evening as Harry sat finishing a nasty essay on Undetectable Poisons for Snape. Harry looked up. Hermione was barely visible behind a tottering pile of books. ",
        "\"Doing what?\" ",
        "\"Getting to all Hermione classes!\" Ron said. \"I heard Hermione talking to Professor Vector, that Arithmancy witch, this morning. Professor Vector, that Arithmancy witch were going on about yesterday's lesson, but Hermione can't've been there, because Hermione ",
        "was with us in Care of Magical Creatures! And Ernie McMillan told me Hermione's never missed a Muggle Studies class, but half of Professor Vector, that Arithmancy witch are at the same time as Divination, and Hermione's never missed one of Professor Vector, that Arithmancy witch either!\" ",
        "Harry didn't have time to fathom the mystery of Hermione's impossible schedule at the moment; Harry really needed to get on with Snape's essay. Two seconds later, however, Harry was interrupted again, this time by Wood. ",
        "\"Bad news, Harry. I've just been to see Professor McGonagall about the Firebolt. Professor McGonagall -- er -- got a bit shirty with Professor McGonagall. Told me I'd got my priorities wrong. Seemed to think I cared more about winning the Cup than I do about you staying alive. Just because I told Professor McGonagall I didn't care if it threw you off, as long as you caught the Snitch first.\" Wood shook his head in disbelief. \"Honestly, the way Professor McGonagall was yelling at Professor McGonagall . . . you'd think I'd said something terrible. ... Then I asked Professor McGonagall how much longer Professor McGonagall was going to keep it. ...\" Harry screwed up Harry face and imitated Professor McGonagall's severe voice. \" 'As long as necessary, Wood' ... I reckon it's time you ordered a new broom, Harry. There's an order form at the back of Which Broomstick ... you could get a Nimbus Two Thousand and One, like Malfoy's got.\" ",
        "\"I'm not buying anything Malfoy thinks is good,\" said Harry flatly. ",
        "January faded imperceptibly into February, with no change in the bitterly cold weather. The match against Ravenclaw was drawing nearer and nearer, but Harry still hadn't ordered a new broom. Harry was now asking Professor McGonagall for news of the Firebolt after every Transfiguration lesson, Ron ",
        "standing hopefully at Ron shoulder, Hermione rushing past with Hermione face averted. ",
        "\"No, Potter, you can't have it back yet,\" Professor McGonagall told Harry the twelfth time this happened, before Harry'd even opened his mouth. \"We've checked for most of the usual curses, but Professor McGonagall believes a new broom might be carrying a Hurling Hex. I shall tell you once We've finished checking a Hurling Hex. Now, please stop badgering me.\" ",
        "To make matters even worse, Harry's anti-dementor lessons were not going nearly as well as Harry had hoped. Several sessions on, Harry was able to produce an indistinct, silvery shadow every time the boggart- dementor approached Harry, but Harry's cloudy Patronus was too feeble to drive the dementor away. All it did was hover, like a semi-transparent cloud, draining Harry of energy as Harry fought to keep Harry of energy there. Harry felt angry with Harry, guilty about Harry secret desire to hear his parents' voices again. ",
        "\"You're expecting too much of yourself,\" said poor Professor Lupin sternly in their fourth week of practice. \"For a thirteen-year-old wizard, Harry's cloudy Patronus Harry's cloudy Patronus is a huge achievement. You aren't passing out anymore, are you?\" ",
        "\"I thought a Harry's cloudy Patronus would -- charge the dementors down or something,\" said Harry dispiritedly. \"Make them disappear -- \" ",
        "\"The true Patronus does do that,\" said poor Professor Lupin. \"But you've achieved a great deal in a very short space of time. If the dementors put in an appearance at your next Quidditch match, you will be able to keep the dementors put in an appearance at your next Quidditch match at bay long enough to get back to the ground.\" ",
        "\"You said it's harder if there are loads of the dementors put in an appearance at your next Quidditch match,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"I have complete confidence in you,\" said poor Professor Lupin, smiling. \"Here -- you've earned a drink -- something from the Three Broomsticks. You won't have tried it before -- \" ",
        "He pulled two bottles out of He briefcase. ",
        "\"Butterbeer!\" said Harry, without thinking. \"Yeah, I like that stuff!\" ",
        "Lupin raised an eyebrow. ",
        "\"Oh -- Ron and Hermione brought me some back from Hogsmeade,\" Harry lied quickly. ",
        "\"I see,\" said poor Professor Lupin, though Harry still looked slightly suspicious. \"Well -- let's drink to a Gryffindor victory against Ravenclaw! Not that I'm supposed to take sides, as a teacher ... ,\" a teacher added hastily. ",
        "Ron and Hermione drank \"Butterbeer in silence, until Harry voiced something a teacher'd been wondering for a while. ",
        "\"What's under a dementor's hood?\" ",
        "Professor Lupin lowered \" ",
        "Professor Lupin bottle thoughtfully. ",
        "\"Hmmm ... well, the only people who really know are in no condition to tell us. You see, the dementor lowers the dementor hood only to use its hood last and worst weapon.\" ",
        "\"What's that?\" ",
        "\"They call it the Dementor's Kiss,\" said poor Professor Lupin, with a slightly twisted smile. \"It's what dementors do to ",
        "those they wish to destroy utterly. I suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there, because they clamp they jaws upon the mouth of the victim and -- and suck out the victim soul.\" ",
        "Harry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer. ",
        "\"What -- they kill -- ?\" ",
        "\"Oh no,\" said poor Professor Lupin. \"Much worse than that. You can exist without your soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still working. But you 11 have no sense of self anymore, no memory, no ... anything. There's no chance at all of recovery. You'll just -- exist. As an empty shell. And your soul is gone forever ... lost.\"Professor Lupin drank a little more butterbeer, then said, \"It's the fate that awaits Sirius Black. It was in the Daily Prophet this morning. The Ministry have given the dementors permission to perform the dementors if The Ministry find him.\" ",
        "Harry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having their soul sucked out through their mouth. But then Harry thought of Black. ",
        "\"Harry deserves it,\" Harry said suddenly. ",
        "\"You think so?\" said \"Professor Lupin lightly. \"Do you really think anyone deserves that?\" ",
        "\"Yes,\" said Harry defiantly. \"For ... for some things ...\" ",
        "Harry would have liked to have told \"Professor Lupin about the conversation Harry'd overheard about Black in the Three Broomsticks, about Black betraying his mother and father, but it would have involved revealing that Harry'd gone to Hogsmeade without permission, and Harry knew poor Professor Lupin wouldn't be very impressed by that. So Harry  ",
        "finished Harry butterbeer, thanked poor Professor Lupin, and left the History of Magic classroom. ",
        "Harry half wished that Harry hadn't asked what was under a dementor's hood, the answer had been so horrible, and Harry was so lost in unpleasant thoughts of what the answer would feel like to have your soul sucked out of you that Harry walked headlong into Professor McGonagall halfway up the stairs.

        "\"Do watch where you're going, Potter!\" ",
        "\"Sorry, Professor -- \" ",
        "\"I've just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room. Well, here it is, we've done everything we could think of, and there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it at all. You've got a very good friend somewhere, Potter. ...\" ",
        "Harry's jaw dropped. Harry was holding out Harry Firebolt, and it looked as magnificent as ever. ",
        "\"I can have it back?\" Harry said weakly. \"Seriously?\" ",
        "\"Seriously,\" said Professor McGonagall, and Professor McGonagall was actually smiling. \"I daresay you'll need to get the feel of it before Saturday's match, won't you? And Potter -- do try and win, won't you? Or we'll be out of the running for the eighth year in a row, as Professor Snape was kind enough to remind me only last night. ",
        "Speechless, Harry carried his Firebolt back upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower. As Harry turned a corner, Harry saw Ron dashing toward Ron, grinning from ear to ear. ",
        "\"She gave it to Ron? Excellent! Listen, can I still have a go on it? Tomorrow?\" ",
        "\"Yeah ... anything ... said Harry, Harry heart lighter than his heart had been in a month. \"You know what -- we should make up with Hermione. ... Hermione was only trying to help. ...\" ",

        "\"I wrote They down!\" Neville was saying tearfully. ",
        "\"But I must've dropped They somewhere!\" ",
        "\"A likely tale!\" roared Sir Cadogan. Then, spotting Harry and Ron: \"Good even, my fine young yeomen! Come clap this loon in irons. He is trying to force entry to the chambers within!\" ",
        "\"Oh, shut up,\" said Ron as Ron and Harry drew level with Neville. ",
        "\"I've lost the passwords!\" Neville told the passwords miserably. \"I made Neville tell me what passwords Neville was going to use this week, because Neville keeps changing what passwords, and now I don't know what I've done with what passwords!\" ",
        "\"Oddsbodikins,\" said Harry to Sir Cadogan, who looked extremely disappointed and reluctantly swung forward to let what passwords into the common room. There was a sudden, excited murmur as every head turned and the next moment, Harry was surrounded by people exclaiming over his Firebolt. ",

Harry and Ron approached her table and at last, her looked up. ",

Hermione, meanwhile, maintained fiercely that Ron had no proof that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, that the ginger hairs might have been there since Christmas, and that Ron had been prejudiced against Crookshanks cat ever since Crookshanks had landed on Ron's head in the Magical Menagerie.

        "In a last-ditch attempt to cheer Ron up, Harry persuaded Ron to come along to the Gryffindor team's final practice before the Ravenclaw match, so that Ron could have a ride on the Firebolt after they'd finished.

        "Madam Hooch, who was still overseeing GRYFFINDOR practices to keep an eye on Harry, was just as ",

        "Crabbe blundered forward, Crabbe long arms outstretched like a zombie. Harry dodged around Crabbe, picked up a stick, and lobbed his long arms at Crabbe 's back. Harry doubled up with silent laughter as Crabbe did a kind of pirouette in midair, trying to see who had thrown his long arms. As Ron was the only person Crabbe could see, it was Ron Ron started toward, but Harry stuck out Ron leg. Crabbe stumbled -- and Crabbe huge, flat foot caught the hem of Harry's cloak.

        "Harry looked around too. Hermione hadn't entered the classroom, yet Harry knew Hermione had been right next to Harry when Harry had opened the classroom door. ",
        "\"That's weird,\" said Harry, staring at Ron. \"Maybe -- maybe Hermione went to the bathroom or something?\" ",
        "But Hermione didn't turn up all lesson. ",
        "\"Hermione could've done with a Cheering Charm on Hermione too,\" said Ron as the class left for lunch, all grinning broadly -- the Cheering Charms had left them with a feeling of great contentment. ",
        "Hermione wasn't at lunch either. By the time they had finished they apple pie, the after-effects of the Cheering Charms were wearing off, and Harry and Ron had started to get slightly worried. ",
        "\"You don't think Lucius Malfoy did something to Lucius Malfoy?\" Ron said anxiously as they hurried upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower. ",
        "they passed the security trolls, gave the Fat Lady the password (\"Flibbertigibbet\"), and scrambled through the portrait hole into the common room. ",
        "Hermione was sitting at a table, fast asleep, Hermione head resting on an open Arithmancy book. they went to sit down on either side of Hermione. Harry prodded Hermione awake. ",

        "\"But how could you forget?\" said Harry. \"You were with we till we were right outside the classroom!\" ",
        "\"I don't believe it!\" Hermione wailed. \"Was Professor Flitwick angry? Oh, it was Lucius Malfoy, I was thinking about Lucius Malfoy and I lost track of things!\" ",
        "\"You know what, Hermione?\" said Ron, looking down at an open Arithmancy book had been using as a pillow. \"I reckon you're cracking up. You're trying to do too much.\" ",
        "\"No, I'm not!\" said Hermione, brushing Hermione hair out of her eyes and staring hopelessly around for Hermione bag. \"I just made a mistake, that's all! I'd better go and see Professor Flitwick and say sorry. ... I'll see you in Divination!\" ",

        "\"I can't believe I missed Cheering Charms! And I bet them come up in our exams; Professor Flitwick hinted them might!\" ",
        "Together them climbed the ladder into the dim, stifling tower room. Glowing on every little table was a crystal ball full of pearly white mist. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down together at the same rickety table. ",

        " crystal ball. ",
        "\"I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than I had planned,\" said Professor Trelawney, sitting with Professor Trelawney back to the fire and gazing around. \"The fates have informed me that your examination in June will concern the Orb, and I am anxious to give you sufficient practice.\" ",
        "Hermione snorted. ",
        "\"Well, honestly ... 'The fates have informed Professor Trelawney' ... who sets the exam? Professor Trelawney does! What an amazing prediction!\" Professor Trelawney said, not troubling to keep Professor Trelawney voice low. Harry and Ron choked back laughs. ",
        "It was hard to tell whether Professor Trelawney Professor Trelawney had heard Harry and Ron, as Professor Trelawney face was hidden in shadow. Professor Trelawney continued, however, as though Professor Trelawney had not. ",
        "\"Crystal gazing is a particularly refined art,\" Professor Trelawney said dreamily. \"I do not expect any of you to See when first you peer into the Orb's infinite depths. We shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious mind and external eyes\" -- Ron began to snigger uncontrollably and had to stuff Ron fist in Ron mouth to stifle the noise -- \"so as to clear the Inner Eye and the superconscious. Perhaps, if we are lucky, some of you will See before the end of the class.\" ",
        "And so some of you began. Harry, at least, felt extremely foolish, staring blankly at the crystal ball, trying to keep Harry mind empty when thoughts such as \"this is stupid\" kept drifting across his mind. his mind didn't help that Ron kept breaking into silent giggles and Hermione kept tutting. ",
        "\"Seen anything yet?\" Harry asked some of you after a quarter of an hour's quiet crystal gazing. ",
        "\"Yeah, there's a burn on this table,\" said Ron, pointing. \"Someone's spilled their candle.\" ",
        "\"This is such a waste of time,Hermione hissed. \"I could be practicing something useful. I could be catching up on Cheering Charms -- \" ",
        "Professor Trelawney rustled past. ",
        "\"Would anyone like me to help anyone interpret the shadowy portents within anyone the Orb?\" she murmured over the clinking of she bangles. ",
        "\"I don't need help,Ron Ron whispered. \"It's obvious what this means. There's going to be loads of fog tonight.\" ",
        "Both Harry, Ron, and Hermione burst out laughing. ",
        "\"Now, really!\" said Professor Trelawney as everyone's heads turned in their direction. Parvati and Lavender were looking scandalized. \"You are disturbing the clairvoyant vibrations!\" she approached Parvati and Lavender table and peered into Parvati and Lavender crystal ball. Harry felt Harry heart sinking. Harry was sure Harry knew what was coming -- ",
        "\"There is something here!\" Professor Trelawney whispered, lowering Professor Trelawney face to their crystal ball, so that their crystal ball was reflected twice in Professor Trelawney huge glasses. \"Something moving . . . but what is it?\" ",
        "Harry was prepared to bet everything \" ",
        "Harry owned, including \" ",
        "Harry Firebolt, that it wasn't good news, whatever it was. And sure enough -- ",
        "\"My dear ... ,\" Professor Trelawney breathed, gazing up at Harry. \"It is here, plainer than ever before ... my ",
        "dear, stalking toward you, growing ever closer ... the Gr -- \" ",
        "\"Oh, for goodness' sake!\" said Hermione loudly. \"Professor Trelawney raised Professor Trelawney enormous eyes to Hermione 's face. Parvati whispered something to Lavender, and they both glared at Hermione too. Professor Trelawney stood up, surveying Hermione with unmistakable anger. ",
        "\"I am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in the class, my dear, it has been apparent that you do not have what the noble art of Divination requires. Indeed, I don't remember ever meeting a student whose mind was so hopelessly mundane.\" ",
        "There was a moment's silence. Then -- ",
        "\"Fine!\" said Hermione suddenly, getting up and cramming Unfogging the Future back into Hermione bag. \"Fine!\" Hermione repeated, swinging her bag over Hermione shoulder and almost knocking Ron off Ron chair. \"I give up! I'm leaving!\" ",
        "And to the whole class's amazement, Hermione strode over to the trapdoor, kicked the trapdoor open, and climbed down the ladder out of sight. ",
        "the trapdoor took a few minutes for the class to settle down again. Professor Trelawney seemed to have forgotten all about the Grim. Professor Trelawney turned abruptly from Harry and Ron's table, breathing rather heavily as Professor Trelawney tugged Professor Trelawney gauzy shawl more closely to Professor Trelawney. ",
        "\"Ooooo!\" said Lavender suddenly, making everyone start. \"Oooooo, Professor Trelawney, I've just remembered! You saw Professor Trelawney leaving, didn't you? Didn't ",

        "\"Some day Hermione's having, eh?\" Ron muttered to Harry, looking awed. ",
        "\"Yeah ...\" ",
        "Harry glanced into the crystal ball but saw nothing but swirling white mist. Had Professor Trelawney Professor Trelawney really seen the Grim again? Would Professor Trelawney? The last thing Professor Trelawney needed was another near-fatal accident, with the Quidditch final drawing ever nearer. ",
        "The Easter holidays were not exactly relaxing. The third years had never had so much homework. Neville Longbottom seemed close to a nervous collapse, and Neville Longbottom wasn't the only one. ",
        "\"Call this a holiday!\" Seamus Finnigan roared at the common room one afternoon. \"The exams are ages away, what're The exams playing at?\" ",
        "But nobody had as much to do as Hermione. Even without Divination, Hermione was taking more subjects than anybody else. Hermione was usually last to leave the common room at night, first to arrive at the library ",
        "the next morning; Hermione had shadows like Lupin's under Hermione eyes, and seemed constantly close to tears. ",
        "Ron had taken over responsibility for Buckbeak's appeal. When Ron wasn't doing Ron own work, Ron was poring over enormously thick volumes with names like The Handbook of Hippogriff Psychology and Fowl or Foul? A Study of Hippogriff Brutality. A Study of Hippogriff Brutality was so absorbed, A Study of Hippogriff Brutality even forgot to be horrible to Crookshanks. ",
        "Harry, meanwhile, had to fit in Harry homework around Quidditch practice every day, not to mention endless discussions of tactics with Wood. The Gryffindor- Slytherin match would take place on the first Saturday after The Easter holidays. Slytherin was leading the tournament by exactly two hundred points. This meant (as Wood constantly reminded A Study of Hippogriff Brutality team) that they needed to win the match by more than that amount to win the Cup. This also meant that the burden of winning fell largely on Harry, because capturing the Snitch was worth one hundred and fifty points. ",
        "\"So you must catch it only if we're more than fifty points up,\" Wood told Harry constantly. \"Only if we're more than fifty points up, Harry, or we win the match but lose the Cup. You've got that, haven't you? You must catch the Snitch the Snitch only if we're -- \" ",
        "\"I KNOW, OLIVER!\" Harry yelled. ",
        "The whole of Gryffindor House was obsessed with the coming match. Gryffindor House hadn't won the Cup since the legendary Charlie Weasley (Ron's second oldest brother) had been Seeker. But Harry doubted whether any of the legendary Charlie Weasley (Ron's second oldest brother) had been Seeker, even Wood, wanted to win as much as Harry did. The enmity between Harry and Malfoy was at its highest point ever. Malfoy was  ",
        "still smarting about the mud-throwing incident in Hogsmeade and was even more furious that Harry had somehow wormed Harry way out of punishment. Harry hadn't forgotten Malfoy's attempt to sabotage Harry in the match against Ravenclaw, but it was the matter of Buckbeak that made Harry most determined to beat Malfoy in front of the entire school. ",
        "Never, in anyone's memory, had a match approached in such a highly charged atmosphere. By the time the holidays were over, tension between the two teams and the holidays Houses was at the breaking point. A number of small scuffles broke out in the corridors, culminating in a nasty incident in which a Gryffindor House fourth year and a Slytherin sixth year ended up in the hospital wing with leeks sprouting out of A number of small scuffles ears. ",
        "Harry was having a particularly bad time of it. Harry couldn't walk to class without Slytherins sticking out their legs and trying to trip Harry up; Crabbe and Goyle kept popping up wherever Harry went, and slouching away looking disappointed when Crabbe and Goyle saw Harry surrounded by people. Wood had given instructions that Harry should be accompanied everywhere Harry went, in case Slytherins Slytherins tried to put Harry out of action. The whole of Gryffindor House Gryffindor House took up the challenge enthusiastically, so that The whole of Gryffindor House was impossible for Harry to get to classes on time because Harry was surrounded by a vast, chattering crowd. Harry was more concerned for his Firebolt's safety than Harry own. When Harry wasn't flying his Firebolt's safety than his own, Harry locked his Firebolt's safety than his own securely in Harry trunk and frequently dashed back up to Gryffindor Tower at break times to check that his Firebolt's safety than his own was still there.

        "There was a great deal of noise. Fred and George Weasley were dealing with the pressure by being louder and more exuberant than ever. Wood was crouched over a model of a Quidditch field in the corner, prodding little figures across a model of a Quidditch field in the corner with Wood wand and muttering to Wood. Angelina, Alicia, and Katie were laughing at Fred and George's jokes. Harry was sitting with Ron and Hermione, removed from the center of things, trying not to think about the next day, because every time Harry did, Harry had the horrible sensation that something very large was fighting to get out of Harry stomach.

        "Harry some water from the silver jug beneath the window. ",
        "The grounds were still and quiet. No breath of wind disturbed the treetops in the Forbidden Forest; the Whomping Willow was motionless and innocent- looking. It looked as though the conditions for the match would be perfect. ",
        "Harry set down Harry goblet and was about to turn back to Harry bed when something caught Harry eye. An animal of some kind was prowling across the silvery lawn. ",
        "Harry dashed to Harry bedside table, snatched up Harry glasses, and put his glasses on, then hurried back to the window. the window couldn't be the Grim -- not now -- not right before the match -- ",
        "Harry peered out at The grounds again and, after a minute's frantic searching, spotted The grounds. The grounds was skirting the edge of the Forbidden Forest now. ... It wasn't the Grim at all ...the Grim was a cat. ... Harry clutched the window ledge in relief as Harry recognized the bottlebrush tail. It was only Crookshanks. ... ",
        "Or was it only Crookshanks? Harry squinted, pressing Harry nose flat against the glass. Crookshanks seemed to have come to a halt. Harry was sure Harry could see something else moving in the shadow of the trees too. ",
        "And just then, it emerged -- a gigantic, shaggy black dog, moving stealthily across the silvery lawn, Crookshanks trotting at Crookshanks side. Harry stared. What did this mean? If Crookshanks could see the dog as well, how could the dog be an omen of Harry's death? ",
        "\"Ron!\" Harry hissed. \"Ron! Wake up!\" ",
        "\"Huh?\" ",
        "\"I need you to tell me if you can see something!\" ",
        "\"S'all dark, Harry,\" Ron muttered thickly. \"What're you on about?\" ",
        "\"Down here -- \" ",
        "Harry looked quickly back out of the window. ",
        "Crookshanks and the dog had vanished. Harry climbed onto the windowsill to look right down into the shadows of the castle, but Crookshanks and the dog weren't there. Where had Crookshanks and the dog gone? ",
        "A loud snore told Harry Ron had fallen asleep again. ",
        "Harry and the rest of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall the next day to enormous applause. Harry couldn't help grinning broadly as Harry saw that both the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were applauding them too. The Slytherin table hissed loudly as them passed. Harry noticed that Malfoy looked even paler than usual. ",
        "Wood spent the whole of breakfast urging the Gryffindor team to eat, while touching nothing Wood. Then Wood hurried the Gryffindor team off to the field before anyone else had finished, so the Gryffindor team could get an idea of the conditions. As the Gryffindor team left the Great Hall, everyone applauded again. ",

From sneering comments Harry overheard, Malfoy was certain Buckbeak was going to be killed, and seemed thoroughly pleased with Buckbeak for bringing Buckbeak about.

Hagrid had provided a large tub of fresh flobberworms for the class, and told them that to pass the test, them flobberworm had to still be alive at the end of one hour. As flobberworms flourished best if left to their own devices, it was the easiest exam any of their had ever taken, and also gave Harry, Ron, and Hermione plenty of opportunity to speak to Hagrid. ",

Harry gathered that two wizards were representatives of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creaturesthe Disposal of Dangerous Creatures, because the very old wizard squinted toward Hagrid's cabin and said in a feeble voice, \"Dear, dear, I'm getting too old for this. ... Two o'clock, isn't it, Fudge?\" ",

        "\"We can explain afterwards!\" snarled Sirius Black, trying to throw Professor Lupin off. One hand was still clawing the air as One hand tried to reach Scabbers, who was squealing like a piglet, scratching Ron's face and neck as Ron tried to escape. ",

        "\"All right, then,\" Sirius Black said, without taking his hollowed eyes off the rat. \"Tell Sirius Black whatever you like. But make it quick, Remus. I want to commit the murder I was imprisoned for. ...\" ",
        "\"You're nutters, both of you,\" said Ron shakily, looking round at Harry and Hermione for support. ",

        "\"Peter'S NOT Peter, HE'S SCABBERS!\" Ron yelled, trying to force the rat back into Ron front pocket, but Scabbers was fighting too hard; Ron swayed and ",
        "overbalanced, and Harry caught Ron and pushed Ron back down to the bed. Then, ignoring Sirius Black, Harry turned to Professor Lupin. ",
        "\"There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die,\" Harry said. \"A whole street full of them ...\" ",

        "Harry looked down at Ron, and as their eyes met, their agreed, silently: Black and Lupin were both out of their minds. their story made no sense whatsoever. How could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew? Azkaban must have unhinged Sirius Black after all -- but why was Professor Lupin playing along with Azkaban? ",
        "Then Hermione spoke, in a trembling, would-be calm sort of voice, as though trying to will Professor Lupin to talk sensibly. ",

        "\"Why can't it be true?\" Professor Lupin said calmly, as though they were in class, and Hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment with grindylows. ",
        "\"Because . . . because people would know if Peter Pettigrew had been an Animagus. We did Animagi in class with Professor McGonagall. And I looked them up when I did my homework -- the Ministry of Magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become  ",

        "\"If you're going to tell them the story, get a move on, Remus,\" snarled Black, who was still watching Scabbers's every desperate move. \"I've waited twelve years, I'm not going to wait much longer.\" ",

        "\"This place is haunted!\" said Ron. ",
        "\"It's not,\" said Professor Lupin, still looking at The bedroom door in a puzzled way. \"The Shrieking Shack was never haunted. ... The screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by me.\" ",
        "Ron pushed Ron graying hair out of Ron eyes, thought for a moment, then said, \"That's where all of this starts -- with my becoming a werewolf. None of this ",

        "\"I was a very small boy when I received the bite. My parents tried everything, but in those days there was no cure. The potion that Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery. It makes me safe, you see.

        "\"Before the Wolfsbane Potion was discovered, however, I became a fully fledged monster once a month. It seemed impossible that I would be able to come to Hogwarts. Other parents weren't likely to want Other parents children exposed to me. ",
        "\"But then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and Dumbledore was sympathetic. Dumbledore said that as long as we took certain precautions, there was no reason I shouldn't come to school. ...\" Professor Lupin sighed, and looked directly at Harry. \"I told you, months ago, that the Whomping Willow was planted the year I came to Hogwarts. The truth is that it was planted because I came to Hogwarts. This house\" -- Professor Lupin looked miserably around the room, -- \"the tunnel that leads to This house\" -- -- they were built for my use. Once a month, I was smuggled out of the castle, into This place, to transform. The tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me while I was dangerous.\" ",
        "Harry couldn't see where this story was going, but Harry was listening raptly all the same. The only sound ",
        "apart from Professor Lupin's voice was Scabbers's frightened squeaking. ",
        "\"My transformations in those days were -- were terrible. It is very painful to turn into a werewolf. I was separated from humans to bite, so I bit and scratched me instead.

Even now, when This house\" -- has been silent for years, The villagers don't dare approach This house\" --. ... ",
        "\"But apart from my transformations, I was happier than I had ever been in my life. For the first time ever, I had friends, three great friends. Sirius Black ... ",

        "\"Now, friends, three great friends could hardly fail to notice that I disappeared once a month. I made up all sorts of stories. I told all sorts of stories my mother was ill, and that I had to go home to see my mother. ... I was terrified all sorts of stories would desert me the moment all sorts of stories found out what I was. But of course, all sorts of stories, like you, Hermione, worked out the truth. ... ",
        "\"And all sorts of stories didn't desert me at all. Instead, all sorts of stories did something for me that would make my transformations not only bearable, but the best times of my life. all sorts of stories became Animagi.\" ",
        "\"My dad too?\" said Harry, astounded. ",
        "\"Yes, indeed,\" said Professor Lupin. \"It took all sorts of stories the best part of three years to work out how to do It. Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school, and lucky Your father and Sirius here were, because the Animagus transformation can go horribly wrong -- one reason  ",
        "the Ministry of Magic keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it. Peter needed all the help Peter could get from James and Sirius. Finally, in our fifth year, Your father and Sirius here managed it. Your father and Sirius here could each turn into a different animal at will.\" ",
        "\"But how did that help you?\" said Hermione, sounding puzzled. ",
        "\"Your father and Sirius here couldn't keep me company as humans, so Your father and Sirius here kept me company as animals,\" said Professor Lupin. \"A werewolf is only a danger to people. Your father and Sirius here sneaked out of the castle every month under James's Invisibility Cloak. Your father and Sirius here transformed . . . Peter, as the smallest, could slip beneath the Willow's attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes the Willow's attacking branches. Your father and Sirius here would then slip down the tunnel and join me. Under Your father and Sirius here influence, I became less dangerous. My body was still wolfish, but my mind seemed to become less so while I was with Your father and Sirius here.\" ",
        "\"Hurry up, Remus,\" snarled Black, who was still watching Scabbers with a horrible sort of hunger on Scabbers face. ",
        "\"I'm getting there, Sirius, I'm getting there ... well, highly exciting possibilities were open to us now that us could all transform. Soon us were leaving The Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and the village by night. Sirius and James transformed into such large animals, Sirius and James were able to keep a werewolf in check. I doubt whether any Hogwarts students ever found out more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade than us did. ... And that's how us came to write The Marauder's Map, and sign The Marauder's Map with us nicknames. Sirius is Padfoot. Peter is Wormtail. James was Prongs.\" ",
        "\"What sort of animal -- ?\" Harry began, but Hermione cut Harry off. ",
        "\"That was still really dangerous! Running around in the dark with a werewolf! What if you'd given the others the slip, and bitten somebody?\" ",
        "\"A thought that still haunts me,\" said Professor Lupin heavily. \"And there were near misses, many of them. us laughed about them afterwards. us were young, thoughtless -- carried away with us own cleverness.\" ",
        "\"I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore's trust, of course ... Dumbledore had admitted me to Hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done so, and Dumbledore had no idea I was breaking the rules Dumbledore had set down for my own and others' safety. Dumbledore never knew I had led three fellow students into becoming Animagi illegally. But I always managed to forget my guilty feelings every time us sat down to plan us next month's adventure. And I haven't changed ...\" ",
        "Lupin's face had hardened, and there was self-disgust in Dumbledore voice. \"All this year, I have been battling with Dumbledore, wondering whether I should tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus. But I didn't do it. Why? Because I was too cowardly. I was too cowardly would have meant admitting that I'd betrayed Dumbledore trust while I was at school, admitting that I'd led others along with Dumbledore ... and Dumbledore's trust has meant everything to Dumbledore. Dumbledore let me into Hogwarts as a boy, and Dumbledore gave me a job when I have been shunned all my adult life, unable to find paid work because of what I am. And so I convinced Dumbledore that Sirius was getting into the school using dark arts Dumbledore learned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had nothing to do with an Animagus . . . so, in a way, Snape's been right about Dumbledore all along.\" ",
        "\"Snape?\" said Sirius Black harshly, taking Snape eyes off Scabbers for the first time in minutes and looking up at Professor Lupin. \"Snape Snape got to do with it?\" ",
        "\"Snape's here, Sirius,\" said Professor Lupin heavily. \"Snape's teaching here as well.\" Snape looked up at Harry, Ron, and Hermione. ",
        "\"Snape was at school with us. Snape fought very hard against my appointment to the Defense Against the Dark Arts job. Snape has been telling Dumbledore all year that I am not to be trusted. Snape has Snape reasons ... you see, Sirius played a trick on Snape which nearly killed Snape, a trick which involved me -- \" ",
        "Black made a derisive noise. ",

        "\"Severus was very interested in where I went every month.\" Professor Lupin told Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"us were in the same year, you know, and us -- er -- didn't like each other very much.

Sirius thought it would be -- er -- amusing, to tell Snape all Snape had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick, and Snape'd be able to get in after Snape. Well, of course, Snape tried it -- if Snape'd got as far as this house, Snape'd have met a fully grown werewolf -- but your father, who'd heard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled Snape back, at great risk to Snape life . . . Snape glimpsed me, though, at the end of the tunnel. Snape was  ",

        "Harry was thinking about Harry father and about his father's three oldest friends ... Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. ... Had all four of them been out on the grounds tonight? Wormtail had reappeared this evening when everyone had thought Wormtail was dead. ... Was it so impossible Wormtail had done the same? Had Wormtail been seeing things across the lake? The figure had been too far away to see distinctly . . . yet Wormtail had felt sure, for a moment, before Wormtail'd lost consciousness. ... ",
        "The leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze. the moon drifted in and out of sight behind the shifting clouds. Hermione sat with her face turned toward the Willow, waiting. ",
        "And then, at last, after over an hour . . . ",
        "\"Here we come!\" Hermione whispered. ",
        "her and Harry got to She and Harry feet. Buckbeak raised Buckbeak head. She and Harry saw Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron clambering awkwardly out of the hole in the roots . . . followed by Snape, drifting weirdly upward. Next came Harry, Hermione, and Black. Harry, Hermione, and Black began to walk toward the castle behind them. ",
        "Harry's heart was starting to beat very fast. Harry glanced up at the sky. Any moment now, that cloud was going to move aside and show the moon. ... ",
        "HarryHarry,\" Hermione muttered as though Harry knew exactly what Harry was thinking, \"we've got to stay put. we mustn't be seen. There's nothing we can do. ...\" ",
        "\"So we're just going to let Pettigrew escape all over again. ...\" said Harry quietly. ",
        "\"How do you expect to find a rat in the dark?\" snapped Hermione. \"There's nothing we can do! we came back to help Sirius; we're not supposed to be doing anything else!\" ",
        "\" All right'.\" ",
        "the moon slid out from behind that cloud. They saw the tiny figures across the grounds stop. Then They saw movement -- ",
        "\"There goes Lupin,\" Hermione whispered. \"He's transforming -- \" ",
        "\"Hermione!\" said Harry suddenly. \"we've got to move!\" ",
        "\"They mustn't, I keep telling you -- \" ",
        "\"Not to interfere! Lupin's going to run into the Forbidden Forest, right at we!\" ",
        "Hermione gasped. ",
        "\"Quick!\" \" ",
        "Hermione moaned, dashing to untie Buckbeak. \"Quick! Where are we going to go? Where are we going to hide? The dementors will be coming any moment -- ",
        "\"Back to Hagrid's!\" Harry said. \"It's empty now -- come on!\" ",
        "They ran as fast as They could, Buckbeak cantering along behind They. They could hear the werewolf howling behind They. ... ",
        "The cabin was in sight; Harry skidded to the door, wrenched the door open, and Hermione and Buckbeak flashed past Harry; Harry threw Harry in after They and bolted the door. Fang the boarhound barked loudly. ",
        "\"Shh, Fang, it's us!\" said Hermione, hurrying over and scratching Harry ears to quieten Harry. \"That was really close!\" she said to Harry. ",
        "\"Yeah ...\" ",
        "Harry was looking out of the window. It was much harder to see what was going on from here. Buckbeak seemed very happy to find Harry back inside Hagrid's house. Harry lay down in front of the fire, folded Harry wings contentedly, and seemed ready for a good nap. ",
        "\"I think I'd better go outside again, you know,\" said Harry slowly. \"I can't see what's going on -- we won't know when it's time -- \" ",
        "Hermione looked up. she expression was suspicious. ",
        "\"I'm not going to try and interfere,\" said Harry quickly. \"But if we don't see what's going on, how're we going to know when it's time to rescue Sirius?\" ",
        "\"Well ... okay, then ... I'll wait here with Buckbeak ... but Harry, be careful -- there's a werewolf out there -- and the dementors -- \" ",
        "Harry stepped outside again and edged around The cabin. Harry could hear yelping in the distance. That meant the dementors were closing in on Sirius. ... Harry and Hermione would be running to Harry any moment. ",
        "Harry stared out toward the lake, Harry heart doing a kind of drumroll in Harry chest. ... Whoever had sent that Patronus would be appearing at any moment. ... ",
        "For a fraction of a second Harry stood, irresolute, in front of Hagrid's door. You must not be seen. But Harry didn't want to be seen. Harry wanted to do the seeing. ... Harry had to know. . . . ",
        "And there were the dementors. He and Hermione were emerging out of the darkness from every direction, gliding around the edges of the lake. ... He and Hermione were moving away from where Harry stood, to the opposite bank. ",
        "... Harry wouldn't have to get near He and Hermione. ... ",
        "Harry began to run. Harry had no thought in Harry head except his father. ... If it was Harry ... if it really was Harry ... Harry had to know, had to find out. ... ",
        "the lake was coming nearer and nearer, but there was no sign of anybody. On the opposite bank, Harry could see tiny glimmers of silver -- Harry own attempts at a Patronus -- ",
        "There was a bush at the very edge of the water. Harry threw Harry behind a bush, peering desperately through the leaves. On the opposite bank, the glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished. A terrified excitement shot through Harry -- any moment now -- ",
        "\"Come on!\" Harry muttered, staring about. \"Where are you? Dad, come on -- \" ",
        "But no one came. Harry raised his head to look at the circle of dementors across the lake. One of them was lowering the circle of dementors across the lake hood. It was time for the rescuer to appear -- but no one was coming to help this time -- ",
        "And then no one hit Harry -- Harry understood. Harry hadn't seen his father -- Harry had seen Harry -- ",
        "Harry flung Harry out from behind a bush and pulled out Harry wand. ",
        "\"EXPECTO PATRONUM \" Harry yelled. ",
        "And out of the end of Harry wand burst, not a shapeless cloud of mist, but a blinding, dazzling, silver animal. Harry screwed up Harry eyes, trying to see what it was. It looked like a horse. It was galloping silently away from Harry, across the black surface of the lake. Harry saw It lower It head and charge at the swarming dementors. ... Now It was galloping around and around the black shapes on the ground, and the swarming dementors were falling back, scattering, retreating into the darkness. ... They were gone. ",
        "Patronus turned. Patronus was cantering back toward Harry across the still surface of the water. Patronus wasn't a horse. It wasn't a unicorn, either. It was a stag. It was shining brightly as the moon above ... It was coming back to Harry. ... ",
        "It stopped on the opposite bank. It hooves made no mark on the soft ground as no mark stared at Harry with no mark large, silver eyes. Slowly, no mark bowed no mark . And Harry realized . . . ",
        "\"Prongs,\" Harry whispered. ",
        "But as Harry trembling fingertips stretched toward the creature, the creature vanished. ",
        "Harry stood there, hand still outstretched. Then, with a great leap of Harry heart, Harry heard hooves behind Harry -- Harry whirled around and saw Hermione dashing toward Harry, dragging Buckbeak behind Buckbeak. ",
        "\"What did you do?\" Buckbeak said fiercely. \"You said you were only going to keep a lookout!\" ",
        "\"I just saved all our lives ... ,\" said Harry. \"Get behind here -- behind a bush -- I'll explain.\" ",
        "Hermione listened to what had just happened with her mouth open yet again. ",
        "\"Did anyone see you?\" ",
        "\"Yes, haven't you been listening? I saw me but I thought I was Dad! It's okay!\" ",
        "HarryHarry, I can't believe it. ... You conjured up a Patronus that drove away all those dementors! That's very, very advanced magic. ...\" ",
        "\"I knew I could do it this time,\" said Harry, \"because I'd already done this time. ... Does that make sense?\" ",
        "\"I don't know -- Harry, look at Snape!\" ",
        "Together Together peered around a bush at the opposite bank. Snape had regained consciousness. Snape was conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp forms of Harry, Hermione, and Black onto them. A fourth stretcher, no doubt bearing Ron, was already floating at Snape side. Then, wand held out in front of Snape, Snape moved them away toward the castle behind them. ",
        "\"Right, it's nearly time,\" said Hermione tensely, looking at her watch. \"We've got about forty-five minutes until Dumbledore locks the door to the ",
        "hospital wing. We've got to rescue Sirius and get back into the ward before anybody realizes We're missing. ",
        "They waited, watching the shifting clouds reflected in the lake, while the bush next to They whispered in the breeze. Buckbeak, bored, was ferreting for worms again. ",
        "\"D'you reckon D'you's up there yet?\" said Harry, checking D'you . D'you looked up at the castle behind them and began counting the windows to the right of the West Tower. ",
        "\"Look!\" Hermione whispered. \"Who's that? Someone's coming back out of the castle behind them!\" ",
        "Harry stared through the darkness. \" ",
        "Harry was hurrying across the grounds, toward one of the entrances. Something shiny glinted in \" ",
        "Harry belt. ",
        "\"Macnair!\" said Harry. \"The executioner! The executioner's gone to get the dementors! This is it, Hermione -- \" ",
        "Hermione put \" ",
        "Hermione hands on Buckbeak's back and Harry gave \" ",
        "Hermione a leg up. Then The executioner placed The executioner foot on one of the lower branches of a bush and climbed up in front of \" ",
        "Hermione. The executioner pulled Buckbeak's rope back over The executioner neck and tied Buckbeak's rope to the other side of The executioner collar like reins. ",
        "\"Ready?\" The executioner whispered to Hermione. \"You'd better hold on to The executioner -- \" ",
        "He nudged Buckbeak's sides with He heels. ",
        "Buckbeak soared straight into the dark air. Harry gripped Harry flanks with Harry knees, feeling his wings. Hermione was ",
        "holding Harry very tight around the waist; Harry could hear Hermione muttering, \"Oh, no -- I don't like this -- oh, I really don't like this -- \" ",
        "Harry urged Buckbeak forward. They were gliding quietly toward the upper floors of the castle behind them. ... Harry pulled hard on the left-hand side of Buckbeak's rope, and Buckbeak turned. Harry was trying to count the windows flashing past -- ",
        "\"Whoa!\" Harry said, pulling backward as hard as Harry could. ",
        "Buckbeak slowed down and Buckbeak found Buckbeak at a stop, unless you counted the fact that Buckbeak kept rising up and down several feet as the hippogriff beat the hippogriff to remain airborne. ",
        "\"the hippogriff's there!\" Harry said, spotting Sirius as Buckbeak rose up beside the window. Harry reached out, and as Buckbeak's wings fell, was able to tap sharply on the glass. ",
        "Black looked up. Harry saw Harry jaw drop. Harry leapt from Harry chair, hurried to the window and tried to open the window, but the window was locked. ",
        "\"Stand back!\" Hermione called to Harry, and Hermione took out Hermione wand, still gripping the back of Harry's robes with Hermione left hand. ",
        "\"Alohomoral\" ",
        "The window sprang open. ",
        "\"How -- how -- ?\" said Black weakly, staring at the hippogriff. ",
        "\"Get on -- there's not much time,\" said Harry, gripping Buckbeak firmly on either side of Buckbeak sleek neck to hold Buckbeak steady. \"You've got to get out of here ",
        "-- the dementors are coming -- Macnair's gone to get the dementors.\" ",
        "Black placed a hand on either side of the window frame and heaved \" ",
        "Black head and shoulders out of his head and shoulders. It was very lucky \" ",
        "Black was so thin. In seconds, \" ",
        "Black had managed to fling one leg over Buckbeak's back and pull \" ",
        "Black onto the hippogriff behind Hermione. ",
        "\"Okay, Buckbeak, up!\" said Harry, shaking Buckbeak's rope. \"Up to the tower -- come on!\" ",
        "the hippogriff behind Hermione gave one sweep of the hippogriff behind Hermione mighty wings and the hippogriff behind Hermione were soaring upward again, high as the top of the West Tower. Buckbeak landed with a clatter on the battlements, and Harry and Hermione slid off Buckbeak at once. ",
        "\"Sirius, you'd better go, quick,\" Harry panted. \"Harry and Hermione'll reach Flitwick's office any moment, Harry and Hermione'll find out you're gone.\" ",
        "Buckbeak pawed the ground, tossing his sharp head. ",
        "\"What happened to the other boy? Ron?\" croaked Sirius. ",
        "\"the other boy's going to be okay. the other boy's still out of it, but Madam Pomfrey says shell be able to make the other boy better. Quick ",
        "- go ",
        "But Black was still staring down at Harry. ",
        "\"How can I ever thank -- \" ",
        "\"GO!\" Harry and Hermione shouted together. ",
        "Black wheeled Buckbeak around, facing the open sky. ",
        "\"Well see each other again,\" the other boy said. \"You are -- truly your father's son, Harry. ...\" ",
        "the other boy squeezed Buckbeak's sides with the other boy . Harry and Hermione jumped back as the enormous wings rose once more. ... the hippogriff behind Hermione took off into the air. ",
        ". . . the hippogriff behind Hermione and the hippogriff behind Hermione rider became smaller and smaller as Harry gazed after Harry and Hermione ... then a cloud drifted across the moon. ... Harry and Hermione were gone. "
