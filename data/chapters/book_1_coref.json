    "THE BOY WHO LIVED": [
        " ",
        "Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. they were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense. ",
        "Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. Mr. Dursley was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although Mr. Dursley did have a very large mustache. Mr. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as Mr. Dursley spent so much of Mr. Dursley time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. Mr. Dursley had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. ",
        "Mr. Dursley had everything their wanted, but their also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. their didn't think their could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mr. Dursley was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but their hadn't ",
        "met for several years; in fact, Mr. Dursley pretended Mr. Dursley didn't have a sister, because Mr. Dursley sister and Mr. Dursley good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. Mr. Dursley shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. Mr. Dursley knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but the Potters had a small son, too had never even seen a small son. ",
        "a small son was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; the Potters had a small son, too didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that. ",
        "When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as Mr. Dursley picked out Mr. Dursley most boring tie for work, and Mr. Dursley gossiped away happily as Mr. Dursley wrestled a screaming Dudley into Mr. Dursley high chair. ",
        "None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window. ",
        "At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up Mr. Dursley briefcase, pecked Mr. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing Dudley cereal at the walls. \"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as Mr. Dursley left the house. Mr. Dursley got into Mr. Dursley car and backed out of number four's drive. ",
        "It was on the corner of the street that Mr. Dursley noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't realize what Mr. Dursley had seen -- then Mr. Dursley jerked Mr. Dursley head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could Mr. Dursley have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at  ",
        "a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive. a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, Mr. Dursley watched a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive in Mr. Dursley mirror. a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave Mr. Dursley a little shake and put a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive out of Mr. Dursley mind. As Mr. Dursley drove toward town Mr. Dursley thought of nothing except a large order of drills Mr. Dursley was hoping to get that day. ",
        "But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As Mr. Dursley sat in the usual morning traffic jam, Mr. Dursley couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! Mr. Dursley supposed this was some stupid new fashion. Mr. Dursley drummed Mr. Dursley fingers on the steering wheel and Mr. Dursley eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of They weren't young at all; why, Mr. Dursley had to be older than Mr. Dursley was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of Mr. Dursley! But then The nerve of him struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something ... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, Mr. Dursley mind back on drills. ",
        "Mr. Dursley always sat with Mr. Dursley back to the window in Mr. Dursley office on the ninth floor. If Mr. Dursley hadn't, Mr. Dursley might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. Mr. Dursley didn't see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; people pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of people had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. Mr. Dursley yelled at five different people. Mr. Dursley made several important telephone  ",
        "calls and shouted a bit more. Mr. Dursley was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when Mr. Dursley thought Mr. Dursley'd stretch Mr. Dursley legs and walk across the road to buy Mr. Dursley a bun from the bakery. ",
        "Mr. Dursley'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until Mr. Dursley passed a group of the people in cloaks next to the baker's. Mr. Dursley eyed the people in cloaks angrily as Mr. Dursley passed. Mr. Dursley didn't know why, but the people in cloaks made Mr. Dursley uneasy. the people in cloaks were whispering excitedly, too, and Mr. Dursley couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on Mr. Dursley way back past the people in cloaks, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that Mr. Dursley caught a few words of what the people in cloaks were saying. ",
        "\"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard -- \" ",
        "\" -- yes, the people in cloaks son, Harry -- \" ",
        "Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded Mr. Dursley. Mr. Dursley looked back at the whisperers as if Mr. Dursley wanted to say something to them, but thought better of the whisperers. ",
        "Mr. Dursley dashed back across the road, hurried up to Mr. Dursley office, snapped at Mr. Dursley secretary not to disturb Mr. Dursley, seized Mr. Dursley telephone, and had almost finished dialing Mr. Dursley home number when Mr. Dursley changed Mr. Dursley mind. Mr. Dursley put the receiver back down and stroked Mr. Dursley mustache, thinking ... no, Mr. Dursley was being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. Potter was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, Potter wasn't even sure Potter nephew was called Harry. Potter'd never even seen his nephew. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; Mrs. Dursley always got so upset at any mention of Mrs. Dursley sister. Potter didn't blame Mrs. Dursley -- if Potter'd had a sister like that ... but all the same, those people in cloaks ... ",
        "Potter found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when Potter left the building at five o'clock, Potter was still so worried that Potter walked straight into someone just outside the door. ",
        "\"Sorry,\" Potter grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mrs. Dursley realized that the tiny old man was wearing a violet cloak. the tiny old man didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, the tiny old man face split into a wide smile and the tiny old man said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \"Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You- Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\" ",
        "And the tiny old man hugged Mrs. Dursley around the middle and walked off. ",
        "Mrs. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. Mrs. Dursley had been hugged by a complete stranger. Mrs. Dursley also thought Mrs. Dursley had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. Mrs. Dursley was rattled. Mrs. Dursley hurried to Mrs. Dursley and set off for home, hoping Mrs. Dursley was imagining things, which Mrs. Dursley had never hoped before, because Mrs. Dursley didn't approve of imagination. ",
        "As Mrs. Dursley pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing Mrs. Dursley saw -- and it didn't improve Mrs. Dursley mood -- was the tabby cat Mrs. Dursley'd spotted that morning. the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning was now sitting on Mrs. Dursley garden wall. Mrs. Dursley was sure the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning was the same one; the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning had the same markings around the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning eyes. ",
        "\"Shoo!\" said Mrs. Dursley loudly. ",
        "the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning didn't move. the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning just gave Mrs. Dursley a stern look. ",
        "Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull Mr. Dursley together, Mr. Dursley let Mr. Dursley into the ",
        "house. Mr. Dursley was still determined not to mention anything to Mr. Dursley wife. ",
        "Mr. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. Mr. Dursley told Mr. Dursley over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door's problems with Mr. Dursley daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (\"Won't!\"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, Dudley went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: ",
        "\"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the nation's owls have suddenly changed Experts sleeping pattern.\" The newscaster allowed The newscaster a grin. \"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\" ",
        "\"Well, Ted,\" said the weatherman, \"I don't know about that, but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee've had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it's not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.\" ",
        "Mr. Dursley sat frozen in Mr. Dursley armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters . . . ",
        "Mr. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. Mr. Dursley'd have to say something to Mr. Dursley. Mr. Dursley cleared Mr. Dursley throat nervously. \"Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven't heard from her sister lately, have you?\" ",
        "As Mr. Dursley had expected, Mr. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended Mr. Dursley didn't have a sister. ",
        "\"No,\" Mr. Dursley said sharply. \"Why?\" ",
        "\"Funny stuff on the news,Mr. Dursley mumbled. \"Owls . . . shooting stars . . . and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today ...\" ",
        "\"So?\" snapped Mr. Dursley. ",
        "\"Well, I just thought ... maybe ... it was something to do with ... you know ... Mr. Dursley crowd.\" ",
        "Mr. Dursley sipped Mr. Dursley tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether Mr. Dursley dared tell Mr. Dursley Mr. Dursley'd heard the name \"Potter.\" Mr. Dursley decided Mr. Dursley didn't dare. Instead Mr. Dursley said, as casually as Mr. Dursley could, \"Their son -- Mr. Dursley'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't Mr. Dursley?\" ",
        "\"I suppose so,\" said Mr. Dursley stiffly. ",
        "\"What's Mr. Dursley name again? Mr. Dursley, isn't it?\" ",
        "Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\" ",
        "\"Oh, yes,\" said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \"Yes, I quite agree.\" ",
        "his didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mr. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window ",
        "and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. The cat was staring down Privet Drive as though The cat were waiting for something. ",
        "Was Mr. Dursley imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did ... if it did got out that they were related to a pair of -- well, Mr. Dursley didn't think Mr. Dursley could bear it did. ",
        "The Dursleys got into bed. Mr. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in Mr. Dursley mind. Mr. Dursley last, comforting thought before Mr. Dursley fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for the Potters to come near Mr. Dursley and Mr. Dursley. the Potters knew very well what Mr. Dursley and Petunia thought about the Potters and the Potters kind. ... Mr. Dursley couldn't see how he and Petunia Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on -- Mr. Dursley yawned and turned over -- it couldn't affect he and Petunia. ... ",
        "How very wrong Mr. Dursley was. ",
        "Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. the cat on the wall outside was sitting as still as a statue, the cat on the wall outside eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. the cat on the wall outside didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat on the wall outside moved at all. ",
        "A man appeared on the corner the cat on the wall outside had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought A man'd just popped out of the ground. the cat on the wall outside's tail twitched and the cat on the wall outside eyes narrowed. ",
        "Nothing like A man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. A man was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of A man hair and beard, which were both long ",
        "enough to tuck into A man belt. A man was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. A man blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and A man nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. A man's name was Albus Dumbledore. ",
        "Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that Albus Dumbledore had just arrived in a street where everything from Albus Dumbledore name to Albus Dumbledore boots was unwelcome. Albus Dumbledore was busy rummaging in Albus Dumbledore cloak, looking for something. But Albus Dumbledore did seem to realize Albus Dumbledore was being watched, because Albus Dumbledore looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at Albus Dumbledore from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat on the wall outside seemed to amuse Albus Dumbledore. Albus Dumbledore chuckled and muttered, \"I should have known.\" ",
        "Albus Dumbledore found what Albus Dumbledore was looking for in Albus Dumbledore inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. Albus Dumbledore flicked It open, held It up in the air, and clicked It. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. Albus Dumbledore clicked The nearest street lamp again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times Albus Dumbledore clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat on the wall outside watching Albus Dumbledore. If anyone looked out of anyone window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, anyone wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Albus Dumbledore slipped the Put- the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where Albus Dumbledore sat down on his garden wall next to the cat on the wall outside. Albus Dumbledore didn't look at the cat on the wall outside, but after a moment Albus Dumbledore spoke to the cat on the wall outside. ",
        "\"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\" ",
        "Albus Dumbledore turned to smile at the tabby, but the tabby had gone. Instead Albus Dumbledore was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat on the wall outside had had around the cat on the wall outside eyes. a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes black hair was drawn into a tight bun. a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes looked distinctly ruffled. ",
        "\"How did you know it was me?\" a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes asked. ",
        "\"My dear Professor, I've never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\" ",
        "\"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day,\" said Professor McGonagall. ",
        "\"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\" ",
        "Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily. ",
        "\"Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right,\" a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes said impatiently. \"You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles have noticed something's going on. It was on they news.\" a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes jerked a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes head back at The Dursleys dark living-room window. \"I heard the Dursleys' dark living-room window. Flocks of owls ... shooting stars. ... Well, Flocks of owls ... shooting stars're not completely stupid. Flocks of owls ... shooting stars were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. Dedalus Diggle never had much sense.\" ",
        "\"You can't blame Flocks of owls ... shooting stars,\" said Albus Dumbledore gently. \"We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.\" ",
        "\"I know that,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably. ",
        "\"But that's no reason to lose We heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad ",
        "daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\" ",
        "a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes threw a sharp, sideways glance at Albus Dumbledore here, as though hoping Albus Dumbledore was going to tell a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes something, but Albus Dumbledore didn't, so a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes went on. \"A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, even the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose Albus Dumbledore really has gone, Albus Dumbledore?\" ",
        "\"It certainly seems so,\" said Albus Dumbledore. \"us all have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\" ",
        "\"A what?\" ",
        "\"A lemon drop. They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of.\" ",
        "\"No, thank you,\" said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though Professor McGonagall didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops. \"As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone -- \" ",
        "\"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call a sensible person like yourself by a sensible person like yourself name? All this You- Know-Who' nonsense -- for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call a sensible person like yourself by a sensible person like yourself proper name: Voldemort.\" Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \"It all gets so confusing if we keep saying You-Know-Who.' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name.\" ",
        "\"I know you haven't,\" said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \"But you're different. Everyone knows you're the only one You- Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\" ",
        "\"You flatter me,\" said Albus Dumbledore calmly. \"Voldemort had powers I will never have.\" ",
        "\"Only because you're too -- well -- noble to use Voldemort.\" ",
        "\"It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me Madam Pomfrey liked my new earmuffs.\" ",
        "Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Albus Dumbledore and said, \"The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyone's saying? About why he's disappeared? ",
        "About what finally stopped he?\" ",
        "It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point Professor McGonagall was most anxious to discuss, the real reason Professor McGonagall had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had a woman fixed Albus Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as Professor McGonagall did now. It was plain that whatever \"everyone\" was saying, Professor McGonagall was not going to believe it until Albus Dumbledore told Professor McGonagall it was true. Albus Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer. ",
        "\"What they're saying,\" Professor McGonagall pressed on, \"is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow. Voldemort went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that Lily and James Potter're -- dead.Albus Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore bowed Albus Dumbledore head. Professor McGonagall gasped. ",
        "\"Lily and James ... I can't believe it ... I didn't want to believe it ... Oh, Albus ...Albus Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore reached out and patted Albus Dumbledore on the shoulder. \"I know ... I know ...\" Professor McGonagall said heavily. ",
        "Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as Professor McGonagall went on. \"That's not all. They're saying Professor McGonagall tried to kill the Potters son, Harry. But -- Professor McGonagall couldn't. Professor McGonagall couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but They're saying that when Professor McGonagall couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's power somehow broke -- and that's why Professor McGonagall's gone.Albus Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore nodded glumly. ",
        "\"It's -- it's true?\" faltered Professor McGonagall. \"After all Professor McGonagall's done ... all the people Professor McGonagall's killed ... Professor McGonagall couldn't kill a little boy? It's just astounding ... of all the things to stop Professor McGonagall . . . but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?\" ",
        "\"We can only guess,\" said Albus Dumbledore. \"We may never know.\" ",
        "Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at Professor McGonagall eyes beneath Professor McGonagall spectacles. Albus Dumbledore gave a great sniff as Albus Dumbledore took a golden watch from Albus Dumbledore pocket and examined a golden watch. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Albus Dumbledore, though, because Albus Dumbledore put It back in his pocket and said, \"Hagrid's late. I suppose it was Albus Dumbledore who told you I'd be here, by the way?\" ",
        "\"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here, of all places?\" ",
        "\"I've come to bring Harry to Harry aunt and uncle. his aunt and uncle're the only family Harry has left now.\" ",
        "\"You don't mean -- you can't mean the people who live here?\" cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to Professor McGonagall ",
        "feet and pointing at number four. \"Dumbledore -- you can't. I've been watching them all day. You couldn't find two people who are less like us. And two people who are less like us've got this son -- I saw this son kicking this son mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!\" ",
        "\"It's the best place for this son,\" said Albus Dumbledore firmly. \"his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to Albus Dumbledore when Albus Dumbledore's older. I've written his aunt and uncle a letter.\" ",
        "\"A letter?\" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on his garden wall. \"Really, Albus Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand Albus Dumbledore! Albus Dumbledore'll be famous -- a legend -- I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child in our world will know Harry -- name!\" ",
        "\"Exactly,\" said Albus Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of Albus Dumbledore half-moon glasses. \"It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous before Albus Dumbledore can walk and talk! Famous for something Albus Dumbledore won't even remember! Can't you see how much better off Albus Dumbledore'll be, growing up away from all that until Albus Dumbledore's ready to take it?\" ",
        "Professor McGonagall opened \" ",
        "Professor McGonagall mouth, changed \" ",
        "Professor McGonagall mind, swallowed, and then said, \"Yes -- yes, you're right, of course. But how is Albus Dumbledore getting here, Albus Dumbledore?\" \" ",
        "Professor McGonagall eyed his cloak suddenly as though \" ",
        "Professor McGonagall thought Albus Dumbledore might be hiding Harry underneath it. ",
        "\"Hagrid's bringing Harry.\" ",
        "\"You think it -- wise -- to trust \"Hagrid with something as important as this?\" ",
        "\"I would trust \"Hagrid with my life,\" said Albus Dumbledore. ",
        "\"I'm not saying Albus Dumbledore heart isn't in the right place,\" said Professor McGonagall \" ",
        "Professor McGonagall grudgingly, \"but you can't pretend Albus Dumbledore's not careless. Albus Dumbledore does tend to -- what was that?\" ",
        "A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as them looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; It swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky -- and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of they. ",
        "If a huge motorcycle was huge, a huge motorcycle was nothing to the man sitting astride a huge motorcycle. the man sitting astride it was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. the man sitting astride it looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild -- long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of the man sitting astride it face, the man sitting astride it had hands the size of trash can lids, and the man sitting astride it feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In the man sitting astride it vast, muscular arms the man sitting astride it was holding a bundle of blankets. ",
        "\"Hagrid,\" said Albus Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \"At last. And where did you get a huge motorcycle?\" ",
        "\"Borrowed a huge motorcycle, Professor Dumbledore, sir,\" said a huge motorcycle, climbing carefully off a huge motorcycle as Professor Dumbledore, sir spoke. \"Young Sirius Black lent a huge motorcycle to sir. I've got Young Sirius Black, sir.\" ",
        "\"No problems, were there?\" ",

        "me Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in Harry eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could Him possibly be?

This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up?

In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only Harry and me Hagrid could see it. Before Harry could mention this, me Hagrid had steered Harry inside. ",
        "For a famous place, me Hagrid was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of A few old women was smoking a long pipe.

        "Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but Harry kept them wide open. Once, Harry thought Harry saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if a burst of fire was a dragon, but too late -- them plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.

        "\"Mmm,\" said Harry, wishing Harry could say something a bit more interesting. ",
        "\"I say, look at Harry!\" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show Hagrid couldn't come in. ",

        "\"the boy's the gamekeeper,\" said Harry. the boy was liking the boy less and less every second. ",
        "\"Yes, exactly. I heard the boy's a sort of savage -- lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then the boy gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to the boy bed.\" ",
        "\"I think the boy's brilliant,\" said Harry coldly. ",
        "\"Do you?\" said the boy, with a slight sneer. \"Why is the boy with you? Where are your parents?\" ",
        "\"your parents're dead,\" said Harry shortly. the boy didn't feel much like going into the matter with the boy. ",
        "\"Oh, sorry,\" said the other, not sounding sorry at all. \"But your parents were our kind, weren't your parents?\" ",

        "\"I really don't think your parents should let the other sort in, do you? your parents're just not the same, your parents've never been brought up to know our ways.

What's your surname, anyway?\" ",
        "But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \"That's you done, my dear,\" and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool. ",

        "\"Nothing,Harry Harry lied. \"Nothing,\" Harry lied stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when Harry found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When \"Nothing,\" Harry lied had left the shop, Harry said, \"Hagrid, what's Quidditch?\" ",
        "\"Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin' how little yeh know -- not knowin' about Quidditch!\" ",

        "\"So what is Quidditch?\" ",

        "\"I bet I'm in Hufflepuff,\" said Harry gloomily. ",
        "\"Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\" said Hagrid darkly. \"There's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.\" ",

Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.

        "Hagrid wouldn't let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (\"Hagrid says pewter on yer list\"), but Hagrid got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then Hagrid visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery- black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).

        "Twenty minutes later, All the kids left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with yeh head under yeh wing. Harry couldn't stop stammering Harry thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell. ",
        "\"Don' mention it,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"\"Don' expect you've had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now -- only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.\" ",
        "A magic wand . . . this was what Harry had been really looking forward to. ",

        "A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of The last shop as A tinkling bell stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though Harry had entered a very strict library; Harry swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to Harry and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of Harry neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic. ",
        "\"Good afternoon,\" said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and Hagrid got quickly off the spindly chair. ",
        "An old man was standing before them, An old man wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of The last shop. ",
        "\"Hello,\" said Harry awkwardly. ",

It seems only yesterday your mother was in here your mother, buying your mother first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. her first wand.\" ",
        "Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished Mr. Ollivander would blink. your mother's eyes were a bit creepy. ",
        "\"Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say Your father favored it -- it's really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.\" ",
        "Mr. Ollivander had come so close that Mr. Ollivander and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see Harry reflected in your mother's eyes. ",
        "\"And that's where ...\" ",
        "Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry's forehead with a long, white finger. ",
        "\"I'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\" Mr. Ollivander said softly. \"Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands ... well, if I'd known what her first wand was going out into the world to do. ...\" ",
        "Yew shook Yew head and then, to Harry's relief, spotted Hagrid. ",

        "... Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn't it?\" ",
        "\"It was, sir, yes,\" said Hagrid. ",
        "\"Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?\" said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern. ",
        "\"Er -- yes, they did, yes,\" said Hagrid, shuffling Hagrid feet. \"I've still got the pieces, though,\" Yew added brightly. ",
        "\"But you don't use the pieces?\" said Mr. Ollivander sharply. ",
        "\"Oh, no, sir,\" said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed Harry gripped Harry pink umbrella very tightly as Harry spoke. ",
        "\"Hmmm,\" said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. \"Well, now -- Mr. Potter. Let me see.\" ",
        "Harry pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of Harry pocket. \"Which is your wand arm?\" ",
        "\"Er -- well, I'm right-handed,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"Hold out your wand arm. That's it.\" Harry measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As Harry measured, Harry said, \"Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard's wand.Harry Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between Harry nostrils, was doing this on this own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes. ",
        "\"That will do,\" Mr. Ollivander said, and a long tape measure. \"Right then, Mr. Potter. Try a long tape measure. Beech-wood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take it and give it a wave.\" ",
        "Harry took A single wand and (feeling foolish) waved A single wand around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched A single wand out of Mr. Ollivander hand almost at once. ",
        "\"Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try -- Harry Harry tried -- but Harry had hardly raised A single wand when A single wand, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander. ",
        "\"No, no -- here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.\" ",
        "Harry tried. And tried. Harry had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier Mr. Ollivander seemed to become. ",
        "\"Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, well find the perfect match here somewhere -- I wonder, now -- yes, why not -- unusual combination -- holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.\" ",
        "Harry took A single wand. Harry felt a sudden warmth in Harry fingers. Harry raised A single wand above his head, brought A single wand swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, \"Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well ... how curious ... how very curious ...\" ",
        "Mr. Ollivander put Harry's wand back into Harry's wand box and wrapped its box in brown paper, still muttering, \"Curious . . . curious ",
        "\"Sorry,\" said Harry, \"but what's curious?\" ",

        "\"I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in A single wand, gave another feather -- just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for A single wand when A single wand brother -- why, its brother gave you that scar.Harry Harry swallowed. ",
        "\"Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. A single wand chooses the wizard, remember. ... I think we must expect great things from you, Harry Potter. ... After all, He-Who- Must-Not-Be-Named did great things -- terrible, yes, but great.\" ",
        "Harry shivered. Harry wasn't sure Harry liked Mr. Ollivander too much. Harry paid seven gold Galleons for Harry's wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed seven gold Galleons from Mr. Ollivander shop. ",
        "The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made Harry and Hagrid way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn't speak at all as Harry and Hagrid walked down the road; Harry didn't even notice how much people were gawking at people on the Underground, laden as people were with all people funny- shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry's lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where people were when Hagrid tapped Harry on the shoulder. ",
        "\"Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\" Harry said. ",

True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry Dudley wouldn't stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn't shut Harry in Harry cupboard, force Harry to do anything, or shout at Harry -- in fact, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn't speak to Harry at all. Half terrified, half furious, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, this did become a bit depressing after a while. ",
        "Harry kept to the same room, with Harry new owl for company. Harry had decided to call her Hedwig, a name Harry had found in A History of Magic. Harry school books were very interesting. Harry lay on Harry bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as Hedwig pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn't come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before Harry went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day ",

Harry checked Harry Hogwarts list yet again to make sure Harry had everything Harry needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in Hedwig cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and Harry's huge, heavy trunk had set off. ",

Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, Harry had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and Harry had no idea how to do it; Harry was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk Harry could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.

        "With the red-haired twins he'd followed through the barrier help, Harry's trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of an empty compartment. ",
        "\"Thanks,\" said Harry, pushing Harry sweaty hair out of his eyes. ",
        "\"What's that?\" said one of the red-haired twins he'd followed through the barrier suddenly, pointing at Harry's lightning scar. ",
        "\"Blimey,\" said the other twin. \"Are you -- ?\" ",
        "\"He is,\" said the first twin. \"Aren't you?\" He added to Harry. ",
        "\"What?\" said Harry. ",
        "\" Harry Potter,\" chorused the red-haired twins he'd followed through the barrier. ",
        "\"Oh, He,\" said Harry. \"I mean, yes, I am.\" ",
        "The two boys gawked at Harry, and Harry felt Harry turning red. Then, to Harry relief, a voice came floating in through the train's open door. ",
        "\"Fred? George? Are you there?\" ",
        "\"Coming, Mom.\" ",
        "With a last look at Harry, the red-haired twins he'd followed through the barrier hopped off the train. ",
        "Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, Harry could watch the red-haired family on a platform packed with people and hear what the red-haired family were saying. the red-haired family mother had just taken out Their mother handkerchief. ",
        "\"Ron, you've got something on your nose.\" ",
        "The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but The youngest boy grabbed The youngest boy and began rubbing the end of The youngest boy nose. ",
        "\"Mom -- geroff.\" The youngest boy wriggled free. ",
        "\"Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on The youngest boy nosie?\" said one of the red-haired twins he'd followed through the barrier. ",
        "\"Shut up,\" said Ron. ",
        "\"Where's Percy?\" said Their mother. ",
        "\"The youngest boy's coming now.\" ",
        "The youngest boy came striding into sight. The youngest boy had already changed into The youngest boy , and Harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge on The youngest boy chest with the letter P on it. ",
        "\"Can't stay long, Their mother,\" The youngest boy said. \"I'm up front, the prefects have got two compartments to the prefects -- \" ",
        "\"Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?\" said one of the red-haired twins he'd followed through the barrier, with an air of great surprise. \"You should have said something, we had no idea.\" ",
        "\"Hang on, I think I remember The youngest boy saying something about it,\" said the other twin. \"Once -- \" ",
        "\"Or twice -- \" ",
        "\"A minute -- \" ",
        "\"All summer -- \" ",
        "\"Oh, shut up,\" said Percy. ",
        "\"How come Percy gets his wizard's robes, anyway?\" said one of the red-haired twins he'd followed through the barrier. ",
        "\"Because Percy's a prefect,\" said Their mother fondly. \"All right, dear, well, have a good term -- send me an owl when you get there.\" ",
        "She kissed Percy on the cheek and Percy left. Then She turned to the red-haired twins he'd followed through the barrier. ",
        "\"Now, you two -- this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you've -- you've blown up a toilet or -- \" ",
        "\"Blown up a toilet? We've never blown up a toilet.\" \"Great idea though, thanks, Mom.\" ",
        "\"It's not funny. And look after Ron.\" ",
        "\"Don't worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with We.\" ",
        "\"Shut up,\" said Ron again. Ron was almost as tall as the red-haired twins he'd followed through the barrier already and Ron nose was still pink where Their mother had rubbed his nose. ",
        "\"Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who We just met on the train?\" ",
        "Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn't see Harry looking. ",

        "\"Who?\" ",

        "\"Never mind that, do you think the poor boy remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?\" ",
        "Their mother suddenly became very stern. ",
        "\"I forbid you to ask the poor boy, Fred. No, don't you dare. As though the poor boy needs reminding of that on the poor boy first day at school.\" ",
        "\"All right, keep your hair on.\" ",
        "A whistle sounded. ",
        "\"Hurry up!\" Their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. their leaned out of the window for Their mother to kiss their good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry. ",
        "\"Don't, the boys' mother, their'll send you loads of owls.\" ",
        "\"Well send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.\" ",
        "\" Georg e\\\" ",
        "\"Only joking, Mom.\" ",
        "the train began to move. Harry saw the three boys waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until the train gathered too much speed, then Their mother fell back and waved. ",
        "Harry watched the girl and Their mother mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. Harry didn't know what Harry was going to -- but it had to be better than what Harry was leaving behind. ",
        "The door of the compartment slid open and the oldest boy came in. ",
        "\"Anyone sitting there?\" the oldest boy asked, pointing at a Hogwarts toilet seat. \"Everywhere else is full.\" ",
        "Harry shook Harry head and the oldest boy sat down. Harry glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending Harry hadn't looked. Harry saw Harry still had a black mark on Harry nose. ",
        "\"Hey, Ron.\" ",
        "the red-haired twins he'd followed through the barrier were back. ",
        "\"Listen, we're going down the middle of the train -- ",
        "Lee Jordan's got a giant tarantula down there.\" ",
        "\"Right,\" mumbled Ron. ",
        "HarryHarry,\" said the other twin, \"did we introduce we? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, we brother. See you later, then.\" ",
        "\"Bye,\" said Harry and Ron. the red-haired twins he'd followed through the barrier slid the compartment door shut behind Harry and Ron. ",
        "\"Are you really Harry Potter?\" Ron blurted out. ",
        "Harry nodded. ",
        "\"Oh -- well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George's jokes,\" said Ron. \"And have you really got -- you know ...\" ",
        "Ron pointed at Harry's forehead. ",
        "Harry pulled back Harry bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared. ",
        "\"So that's where You-Know-Who -- ?\" ",
        "\"Yes,\" said Harry, \"but I can't remember it.\" ",
        "\"Nothing?\" said Ron eagerly. ",
        "\"Well -- I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.\" ",
        "\"Wow,\" said Ron. Ron sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though Ron had suddenly realized what Ron was doing, Ron looked quickly out of the window again. ",
        "\"Are all your family wizards?\" asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found Ron. ",
        "\"Er -- yes, I think so,\" said Ron. \"I think Mom's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about a second cousin who's an accountant.\" ",
        "\"So you must know loads of magic already.\" ",
        "The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about. ",
        "\"I heard you went to live with Muggles,\" said Ron. \"What are they like?\" ",
        "\"Horrible -- well, not all of they. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I'd had three wizard brothers.\" ",
        "\"Five,\" said Ron. For some reason, Ron was looking gloomy. \"I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I've got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left -- Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but Fred and George still get really good marks and everyone thinks Fred and George're really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it's no big deal, because Fred and George did as well first. You never get anything new, either, with three wizard brothers. I've got Bill's old robes, Charlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat.\" ",
        "Ron reached inside Ron jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep. ",
        "\"Ron name's Scabbers and Ron's useless, Ron hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but being made a prefect couldn't aff -- I mean, I got Scabbers instead.\" ",
        "Ron's ears went pink. Ron seemed to think Ron'd said too much, because Ron went back to staring out of the window. ",
        "Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, Harry'd never had any money in Harry life until a month ago, and Harry told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up. ",
        "\"... and until Hagrid told me, I didn't know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort -- Ron Ron gasped. ",
        "\"What?\" said Harry. ",
        "\" You said You-Know-Who's name\\\" said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. \"I'd have thought you, of all people -- \" ",
        "\"I'm not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,\" said Harry, \"I just never knew you shouldn't. See what I mean? I've got loads to learn. ... I bet,\" Harry added, voicing for the first time something that had ",
        "been worrying Harry a lot lately, \"I bet I'm the worst in the class.\" ",
        "\"You won't be. There's loads of people who come from Muggle families and loads of people who come from Muggle families learn quick enough.\" ",
        "While loads of people who come from Muggle families had been talking, the train had carried loads of people who come from Muggle families out of London. Now loads of people who come from Muggle families were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. loads of people who come from Muggle families were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past. ",
        "Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back a smiling, dimpled woman door and said, \"Anything off the cart, dears?\" ",
        "Harry, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt to Harry feet, but Ron's ears went pink again and Ron muttered that Ron'd brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor. ",
        "Harry had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that Harry had pockets rattling with gold and silver Harry was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as Harry could carry -- but the woman didn't have as many Mars Bars. What the woman did have were Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in Harry life. Not wanting to miss anything, Harry got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts. ",
        "Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped the compartment onto an empty seat. ",
        "\"Hungry, are you?\" ",
        "\"Starving,\" said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty. ",
        "Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped a lumpy package. There were four sandwiches inside. Ron pulled one of four sandwiches apart and said, \"She always forgets I don't like corned beef.\" ",
        "\"Swap you for one of these,\" said Harry, holding up a pasty. \"Go on -- \" ",
        "\"You don't want this, it's all dry,\" said Ron. \"She hasn't got much time,\" Ron added quickly, \"you know, with five of us.\" ",
        "\"Go on, have a pasty,\" said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. it was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties, cakes, and candies (four sandwiches lay forgotten). ",
        "\"What are these?\" Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. \"They're not really frogs, are They?\" Harry was starting to feel that nothing would surprise Harry. ",
        "\"No,\" said Ron. \"But see what the card is. I'm missing Agrippa.\" ",
        "\"What?\" ",
        "\"Oh, of course, you wouldn't know -- Chocolate Frogs have cards inside Chocolate Frogs, you know, to collect -- famous witches and wizards. I've got about five hundred, but I haven't got Agrippa.\" ",
        "Harry unwrapped Harry Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. the card showed a man's face. a man wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver ",
        "hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was Dumbledore. ",
        "\"So this is Dumbledore!\" said Harry. ",
        "\"Don't tell me you'd never heard of Dumbledore!\" said Ron. \"Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa -- thanks ",
        "Harry turned over the card and read: ",
        "ALBUS DUMBLEDORE ",
        "CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HogwartsConsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for Dumbledore defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and Dumbledore work on alchemy with Dumbledore partner, Nicolas Flamel. Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten pin bowling. ",
        "Harry turned the card back over and saw, to Harry astonishment, that Dumbledore 's face had disappeared. ",
        "\"Dumbledore's gone!\" ",
        "\"Well, you can't expect Dumbledore to hang around all day,\" said Ron. \"Dumbledore'll be back. No, I've got Morgana again and I've got about six of Morgana ... do you want it? You can start collecting.\" ",
        "Ron's eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped. ",
        "\"Help yourself,\" said Harry. \"But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.\" ",
        "\"Do people? What, people don't move at all?\" Ron sounded amazed. \"Weird).\" ",
        "Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on the card and gave Harry a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep \" ",
        "Ron's eyes off the Famous Witches. Soon Harry had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcraft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. Harry finally tore \" ",
        "Ron's eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. ",
        "\"You want to be careful with those,\" Ron warned Harry. \"When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor -- you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons George had a booger-flavored one once.\" ",
        "Ron picked up a green bean, looked at a green bean carefully, and bit into a corner. ",
        "\"Bleaaargh -- see? Sprouts.\" ",
        "Sprouts had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn't touch, which turned out to be pepper. ",
        "The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills. ",
        "There was a knock on the door of woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on ",
        "platform nine and three-quarters came in. the round-faced boy Harry looked tearful. ",
        "\"Sorry,\" the round-faced boy Harry said, \"but have you seen a toad at all?\" ",
        "When nine and three-quarters shook nine and three-quarters heads, the round-faced boy Harry wailed, \"I've lost the round-faced boy Harry! the round-faced boy Harry keeps getting away from the round-faced boy Harry!\" ",
        "\"Hell turn up,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"Yes,\" said the round-faced boy Harry miserably. \"Well, if you see the round-faced boy Harry ...\" the round-faced boy Harry left. ",
        "\"Don't know why the round-faced boy Harry's so bothered,\" said Ron. \"If I'd brought a toad I'd lose a toad as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can't talk.\" ",
        "The rat was still snoozing on Ron's lap. ",
        "\"Scabbers might have died and you wouldn't know the difference,\" said Ron in disgust. \"I tried to turn Scabbers yellow yesterday to make Scabbers more interesting, but the spell didn't work. I'll show you, look ...\" ",
        "Scabbers rummaged around in Scabbers trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand. a very battered-looking wand was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end. ",
        "\"Unicorn hair's nearly poking out. Anyway -- \" ",
        "Scabbers had just raised a very battered-looking wand when the compartment door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time The toadless boy had a girl with The toadless boy. a girl was already wearing a girl new Hogwarts robes. ",
        "\"Has anyone seen a toad? Neville's lost one,\" a girl said. a girl had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth. ",
        "\"We've already told The toadless boy We haven't seen it,\" said Ron, but a girl wasn't listening, a girl was looking at a very battered-looking wand in The toadless boy hand. ",
        "\"Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then.\" ",
        "a girl sat down. Ron looked taken aback. ",
        "\"Er -- all right.\" ",
        "Ron cleared Ron throat. ",
        "\" Sunshine , daisies, butter mellow, ",
        "Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.\" ",
        "Ron waved a very battered-looking wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep. ",
        "\"Are you sure that's a real spell?\" said a girl. \"Well, it's not very good, is it? I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for Ron. Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, I've heard -- I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough -- I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?\" ",
        "She said all this very fast. ",
        "Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by Harry stunned face that Harry hadn't learned all the course books by heart either. ",
        "\"I'm Ron Weasley,Ron Ron muttered. ",
        "\"Harry Potter,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"Are you really?\" said Hermione. \"I know all about you, of course -- I got a few extra books for background reading, and you're in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.\" ",
        "\"Am I?\" said Harry, feeling dazed. ",
        "\"Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I could if it was me,\" said Hermione. \"Do either of you know what House you'll be in? I've been asking around, and I hope I'm in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn't be too bad. ... Anyway, we'd better go and look for Neville's toad. ",
        "You two had better change, you know, I expect we'll be there soon.\" ",
        "And she left, taking the toadless boy with she. ",
        "\"Whatever House I'm in, I hope House's not in House,\" said Ron. Ron threw a very battered-looking wand back into his trunk. \"Stupid spell -- George gave a very battered-looking wand to Ron, bet George knew a very battered-looking wand was a dud.\" ",
        "\"what House are your brothers in?\" asked Harry. ",
        "\"Gryffindor,\" said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on Ron again. \"Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what Mom and Dad'll say if I'm not. I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if Mom and Dad put me in Slytherin.\" ",
        "\"That's the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?\" ",
        "\"Yeah,\" said Ron. Ron flopped back into Ron seat, looking depressed. ",
        "\"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter,\" said Harry, trying to take Ron's mind off Houses. \"So what do your brothers do now that your brothers've left, anyway?\" ",
        "Harry was wondering what a wizard did once Harry'd finished school. ",
        "\"Charlie's in Romania studying dragons, and Bill's in Africa doing something for Gringotts,\" said Ron. \"Did you hear about Gringotts? It's been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don't suppose you get that with the Muggles -- someone tried to rob a high security vault.\" ",
        "Harry stared. ",
        "\"Really? What happened to them?\" ",
        "\"Nothing, that's why it's such big news. them haven't been caught. My dad says it must've been a powerful Dark wizard to get GringottsGringotts, but them don't think them took anything, that's what's odd. 'Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who's behind this.\" ",
        "Harry turned this news over in Harry mind. Harry was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know- Who was mentioned. Harry supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but this had been a lot more comfortable saying \"Voldemort\" without worrying. ",
        "\"What's your Quidditch team?\" Ron asked. ",
        "\"Er -- I don't know any,Harry Harry confessed. ",
        "\"What!\" Ron looked dumbfounded. \"Oh, you wait, it's the best game in the world -- \" And Ron was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of ",
        "the seven players, describing famous games Ron'd been to with Ron brothers and the broomstick Ron'd like to get if Ron had the money. Ron was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but the compartment door wasn't Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.

        "Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: It was the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop. the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop'd shown back in Diagon Alley. ",
        "\"Is it true?\" the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop said. \"They're saying all down the train that Harry Potter's in this compartment. So it's you, is it?\" ",
        "\"Yes,\" said Harry. the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop was looking at Three boys. Both of Three boys were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop, Both of them looked like bodyguards. ",
        "\"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\" said the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. ",
        "\"And my names Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.\" ",
        "Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at Draco Malfoy. ",
        "\"Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. Draco Malfoy told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than all the Weasleys can afford.\" ",
        "Draco Malfoy turned back to Harry. \"You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, ",
        "Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.\" ",
        "Draco Malfoy held out Draco Malfoy hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take his hand. ",

        "Draco Malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in Draco Malfoy pale cheeks. ",
        "\"I'd be careful if I were you, Harry Potter's,\" Draco Malfoy said slowly. \"Unless you're a bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents. your parents didn't know what was good for your parents, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it'll rub off on you.\" ",
        "Both Harry and Ron stood up. ",
        "\"Say that again,\" Ron said, Ron face as red as Ron hair. ",
        "\"Oh, you're going to fight us, are you?\" Draco Malfoy sneered. ",
        "\"Unless you get out now,\" said Harry, more bravely than Harry felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than Harry or Ron. ",
        "\"But us don't feel like leaving, do us, boys? us've eaten all us food and you still seem to have some.\" ",
        "Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron -- Ron leapt forward, but before Ron'd so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell. ",
        "Scabbers The rat was hanging off Scabbers finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle 's knuckle -- Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once.

        "more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps them'd heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in. ",

        "And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across a great black lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over Everyone as Everyone sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which It stood. ",

        "A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes pulled front door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys' house in The entrance hall. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing the ones at Gringotts led to the upper floors. ",
        "the ones at Gringotts followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right -- the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off The entrance hall. the ones at Gringotts crowded in,  ",
        "standing rather closer together than the ones at Gringotts would usually have done, peering about nervously. ",
        "\"Welcome to Hogwarts,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in The entrance hall, you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is The Sorting Ceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House common room. ",
        "\"your Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. House House has House own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule- breaking will lose House points.

        "\"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.\" ",
        "Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which was fastened under Neville left ear, and on Ron's smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten Harry hair. ",
        "\"I shall return when we are ready for you,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Please wait quietly.\" ",
        "Her left the chamber. Harry swallowed. ",
        "\"How exactly do they sort we into Houses?\" Harry asked Ron. ",
        "\"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think Fred was joking.\" ",
        "Harry's heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the school? But Fred didn't know any magic yet -- what on earth would Fred have to do? Fred hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived. Fred looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one she'd need. Harry tried hard not to listen to she. Harry'd never been more nervous, never, not even when Harry'd had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that Harry'd somehow turned Harry teachers wig blue. Harry kept Her eyes fixed on front door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead Professor McGonagall to Professor McGonagall doom. ",
        "Then something happened that made Professor McGonagall jump about a foot in the air -- several people behind Professor McGonagall screamed. ",
        "\"What the -- ?\" ",
        "Professor McGonagall gasped. So did the people around Professor McGonagall. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, About twenty ghosts glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. About twenty ghosts seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: \"Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give a fat little monk a second chance -- \" ",
        "\"My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances a fat little monk deserves? a fat little monk gives us all a bad name and ",

        "A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years. ",
        "Nobody answered. ",
        "\"New students!\" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at \"New students. \"About to be Sorted, I suppose?\" ",
        "A few people nodded mutely. ",
        "\"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!\" said the Fat Friar. \"My old House, you know.\" ",
        "\"Move along now,\" said a sharp voice. \"The Sorting Ceremony about to start.\" ",
        "Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, About twenty ghosts floated away through the back wall. ",
        "\"Now, form a line,\" Professor McGonagall told the first years, \"and follow me.\" ",
        "Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron, and they walked out of the chamber, back across The entrance hall, and through a pair of double doors into The entrance hall. ",
        "Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of The entrance hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that the teachers  ",
        "came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind the teachers. The hundreds of faces staring at the teachers looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, About twenty ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. Harry heard Hermione whisper, \"It's bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about It in Hogwarts, A History.\" ",
        "It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that The entrance hall didn't simply open on to the heavens. ",
        "Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of a four-legged stool she put a pointed wizard's hat. a pointed wizard's hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let a pointed wizard's hat in My old House. ",
        "Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of a rabbit, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in The entrance hall was now staring at a pointed wizard's hat, Harry stared at everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then a pointed wizard's hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth -- and a pointed wizard's hat began to sing: ",
        "\"Oh, you may not think I'm pretty, ",
        "But don't judge on what you see, ",
        "I'll eat Harry if you can find ",
        "A smarter hat than Harry. ",
        "You can keep your bowlers black, ",
        "Your top hats sleek and tall, ",
        "For I'm a pointed wizard's hat And I can cap Your top hats. ",
        "There's nothing hidden in your head a pointed wizard's hat can't see, ",
        "So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be. ",
        "You might belong in Gryffindor, ",
        "Where dwell the brave at heart, ",
        "Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; ",
        "You might belong in Hufflepuff, ",
        "Where Their are just and loyal, ",
        "Those patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of toil; ",
        "Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, ",
        "If you've a ready mind, ",
        "Where those of wit and learning, ",
        "Will always find those of wit and learning kind; ",
        "Or perhaps in Slytherin ",
        "You'll make your real friends, ",
        "Those cunning folk use any means To achieve Those cunning folk ends. ",
        "So put me on! Don't be afraid l\\ ",
        "And don't get in a flap\\ ",
        "You're in safe hands (though I have none) ",

        "The whole hall burst into applause as a pointed wizard's hat finished a pointed wizard's hat song. The whole hall bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again. ",
        "\"So we've just got to try on a pointed wizard's hat!\" Ron whispered to Harry. \"I'll kill Fred, Fred was going on about wrestling a troll.\" ",
        "Harry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on a pointed wizard's hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but Fred did wish they could have tried a pointed wizard's hat on without everyone watching. a pointed wizard's hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of a pointed wizard's hat at the moment. If only a pointed wizard's hat had mentioned a House for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for only the hat had mentioned a House for people who felt a bit queasy. ",
        "Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment. ",
        "\"When I call your name, you will put on a pointed wizard's hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,\" Professor McGonagall said. \"Abbott, Hannah!\" ",
        "A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails eyes, and sat down. A moment's pause -- ",
        "\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted a pointed wizard's hat. ",
        "The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. ",

        "\"Bones, Susan!\" ",
        "\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted a pointed wizard's hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah. ",

        "\"RAVENCLAW!\" ",
        "The table on the right second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as Terry joined several Ravenclaws. ",
        "\"Brocklehurst, Mandy\" went to Ravenclaw too, but \"Brown, Lavender\" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling. ",
        "\"Bulstrode, Millicent\" then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry's imagination, after all Harry'd heard about a Slytherin, but Harry thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. ",
        "Harry was starting to feel definitely sick now. Harry remembered being picked for teams during gym at the school. Harry had always been last to be chosen, not because Harry was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked Harry. ",
        "\"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!\" ",
        "\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" ",
        "Sometimes, Harry noticed, a pointed wizard's hat shouted out the House at once, but at others the House took a little while to decide. \"Finnigan, Seamus,\" the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before a pointed wizard's hat declared him a Gryffindor.

        "\"Granger, Hermione!\" ",
        "Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed a pointed wizard's hat eagerly on Hermione head. ",

What if Harry just sat there with the hat over Harry eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall jerked it off her head and said there had obviously been a mistake and Harry'd better get back on the train?

        "When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing Harry toad, was called, Harry fell over on Harry way to the stool. a pointed wizard's hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When a pointed wizard's hat finally shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR,\" Neville ran off still wearing a pointed wizard's hat, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give a pointed wizard's hat to \"MacDougal, Morag.\" ",
        "Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: a pointed wizard's hat had barely touched his when a pointed wizard's hat screamed, \"SLYTHERIN!\" ",
        "Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with his. ",
        "There weren't many people left now. ",

        "\" The Harry Potter?\" ",
        "The last thing Harry saw before a pointed wizard's hat dropped over Her eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at Harry. Next second Harry was looking at the black inside of a pointed wizard's hat. Harry waited. ",
        "\"Hmm,\" said a small voice in Harry ear. \"Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, oh my goodness, yes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting. ... So where shall I put you?\" ",
        "Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin. ",
        "\"Not Slytherin, eh?\" said the small voice. \"Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and a Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that -- no? Well, if you're sure -- better be GRYFFINDOR!\" ",
        "Harry heard a pointed wizard's hat shout the last word to The whole hall. Harry took off a pointed wizard's hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. Harry was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in a Slytherin, Harry hardly noticed ",
        "that Harry was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook Percy the Prefect hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, \"the Weasley twins got -- ",

        "the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier sat Hagrid, who caught the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier eye and gave the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized Albus Dumbledore at once from the card Harry'd gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Albus Dumbledore's silver hair was the only thing in The whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. Harry was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban. ",
        "And now there were only four people left to be sorted. \"Thomas, Dean,\" a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. \"Turpin, Lisa,\" became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron's turn.

        "\"Well done, Ron, excellent,\" said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as \"Zabini, Blaise,\" was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up Professor McGonagall scroll and took a pointed wizard's hat away. ",

        "\"Mad?\" said Percy the Prefect airily. \"Harry's a genius! Best wizard in the world! But Harry is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?\" ",
        "Harry's mouth fell open. The dishes in front of Harry were now piled with food. Harry had never seen so many things Harry liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs. ",
        "The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but The Dursleys'd never been allowed to eat as much as The Dursleys liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made Harry sick. Harry piled Harry plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.

        "\"That does look good,\" said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up Harry steak. ",

        "As Harry helped Harry to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families. ",

Professor Snape was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed Professor Snape horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Professor Snape had somehow managed to melt Seamus's cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people's shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Professor Snape, who had been drenched in their potion when Seamus's cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over Professor Snape arms and legs.

Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean's poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move. ",

At breakfast on Thursday Harry bored them all stupid with flying tips Harry'd gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Professor Snape was hanging on to Harry every word, desperate for anything that might help Professor Snape hang on to a broomstick in front of Malfoy later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione 's lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.

Harry pulled a broomstick in front of Malfoy up a little to take a broomstick in front of Malfoy even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.

        "\"We've got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,\" said Ron, \"quickly as possible.\" ",
        "\"Malfoy tricked you,Hermione said to Harry. \"You realize that, don't you? him was never going to meet you -- Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, \"Malfoy must have tipped someone off.\" ",
        "Harry thought Harry was probably right, but Harry wasn't going to tell Harry that. ",
        "\"Let's go.\" ",
        "It wasn't going to be that simple. They hadn't gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of They. ",
        "It was Peeves. Harry caught sight of They and gave a squeal of delight. ",
        "\"Shut up, Peeves -- please -- you'll get us thrown out.\" ",
        "Peeves cackled. ",
        "\"Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you'll get caughty.\" ",
        "\"Not if you don't give us away, Peeves, please.\" ",
        "\"Should tell Filch, I should,\" said Peeves in a sanity voice, but Peeves eyes glittered wickedly. \"It's for your own good, you know.\" ",
        "\"Get out of the way,\" snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves -- this was a big mistake. ",
        "\"STUDENTS OUT OF BED!\" Peeves bellowed, \"STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!\" ",
        "Ducking under Peeves, they ran for they lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door -- and right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door was locked. ",
        "\"This is it!\" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at a door, \"they're done for! This is the end!\" ",
        "they could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as Filch could toward Peeves 's shouts. ",
        "\"Oh, move over,\" Hermione snarled. Hermione grabbed Harry's wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, \"Alohomora\\\" ",
        "the lock clicked and a door swung open -- the lock piled through the lock, shut the lock quickly, and pressed the lock ears against the lock, listening. ",
        "\"Which way did the lock go, Peeves?\" Filch was saying. \"Quick, tell me.\" ",
        "\"Say 'please.' \" ",
        "\"Don't mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?\" ",
        "\"Shan't say nothing if you don't say please,\" said Peeves in Peeves annoying singsong voice. ",
        "\"All right -- please.\" ",
        "\"NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage. ",
        "\"Peeves thinks a door is locked,\" Harry whispered. \"I think well be okay -- get off Neville!\" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry's bathrobe for the last minute. \"What?\" ",
        "Harry turned around -- and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, Harry was sure Harry'd walked into a nightmare -- this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far. ",
        "They weren't in a room, as Harry had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now They knew why The forbidden corridor on the third floor was forbidden. ",
        "They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs. ",
        "It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes, and Harry knew that the only reason Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes weren't already dead was that Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes sudden appearance had taken their sudden appearance by surprise, but their sudden appearance was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant. ",
        "Harry groped for the doorknob -- between Filch and death, Harry'd take Filch. ",
        "They fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and They ran, They almost flew, back down a corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for They somewhere else, because They didn't see Filch anywhere, but They hardly cared -- all They wanted to do was put as much space as possible between They and that monster. They didn't stop running until They ",
        "reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor. ",
        "\"Where on earth have you all been?\" the Fat Lady asked, looking at They bathrobes hanging off They shoulders and They flushed, sweaty faces. ",
        "\"Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout,\" panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the trophy room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs. ",
        "It was a while before any of They said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if Neville'd never speak again. ",
        "\"What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?\" said Ron finally. \"If any dog needs exercise, that one does.\" ",
        "Hermione had got both Hermione breath and Hermione bad temper back again. ",
        "\"You don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?\" Hermione snapped. \"Didn't you see what it was standing on?\" ",
        "\"The floor?\" Harry suggested. \"I wasn't looking at it feet, I was too busy with it .\" ",
        "\"No, not the floor. it was standing on a trapdoor. it's obviously guarding something.\" ",
        "Hermione stood up, glaring at them. ",
        "\"I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed -- or worse, expelled. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to bed.\" ",
        "Ron stared after Hermione, Ron mouth open. ",
        "\"No, We don't mind,\" Ron said. \"You'd think We dragged Hermione along, wouldn't you?\" ",
        "But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as Harry climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something. . . . What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide -- except perhaps Hogwarts. ",
        "Gringotts looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was. ",
        "10 ",
        "HALLOWEEN ",
        "\"Malfoy couldn't believe Harry eyes when Harry saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting The dog had been an excellent adventure, and Harry and Ron were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and Harry and Ron spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection. ",
        "\"It's either really valuable or really dangerous,\" said Ron. ",
        "\"Or both,\" said Harry. ",
        "But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues. ",
        "Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near The dog again. ",
        "Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but Hermione was such a bossy know-it-all that Harry and Ron saw this as an added bonus. All Harry and Ron really wanted now was a way of getting back at \"Malfoy, and to Harry and Ron great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later. ",
        "As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone's attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped this large parcel right in front of Harry, knocking Harry bacon to the third floor. the owls had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of this large parcel.

        "Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said: ",
        "DO NOT OPEN this large parcel AT THE TABLE. ",
        "it said: ",
        "DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want everybody knowing you've got a broomstick or the owls'll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training session. ",

        "\"That's a broomstick,\" he said, throwing the package back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on Harry face. \"You'll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren't allowed Potter.\" ",
        "Ron couldn't resist it. ",
        "\"It's not any old broomstick,\" Ron said, \"it's a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you've got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\" Ron grinned at Harry. \"Comets look flashy, but Comets're not in the same league as the Nimbus.\" ",
        "\"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn't afford half the handle,\" \"Malfoy snapped back. \"I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.\" ",

        "\"Yes, yes, that's right,\" said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. \"Professor Flitwick told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?\" ",
        "\"A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,\" said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on \"Malfoy's face. \"And it's really thanks to \"Malfoy here that I've got it,\" \"Malfoy added. ",

        "\"So I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules?\" came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry's hand. ",
        "\"I thought you weren't speaking to us?\" said Harry. ",
        "\"Yes, don't stop now,\" said Ron, \"it's doing us so much good.\" ",
        "Hermione marched away with her nose in the air. ",
        "Harry had a lot of trouble keeping Harry mind on Harry lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where Harry new broomstick was lying under Harry bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where Harry'd be learning to play that night. Harry bolted Harry dinner that evening without noticing what Harry was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last. ",
        "\"Wow,\" Ron sighed, as his new broomstick rolled onto Harry's bedspread. ",
        "Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of ",
        "neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top. ",
        "As seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. Harry'd never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the Quidditch field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the Quidditch field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that They were fifty feet high. ",
        "Too eager to fly again to wait for Oliver Wood, Harry mounted his new broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling -- Harry swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the Quidditch field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever Harry wanted at Harry lightest touch. ",
        "\"Hey, Potter, come down!Oliver Wood Oliver Wood had arrived. Oliver Wood was carrying a large wooden crate under Oliver Wood arm. Harry landed next to Oliver Wood. ",
        "\"Very nice,\" said Wood, Harry eyes glinting. \"I see what Professor Flitwick meant ... you really are a natural. I'm just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week.\" ",
        "Oliver Wood opened a large wooden crate. Inside were four different-sized balls. ",
        "\"Right,\" said Oliver Wood. \"Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it's not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of seven players on each side are called Chasers.\" ",
        "\"Three Chasers,Harry Harry repeated, as Oliver Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball. ",
        "\"a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball's called the Quaffle,\" said Oliver Wood. \"Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get the Quaffle through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?\" ",
        "\"Chasers throw the Quaffle and put the Quaffle through the hoops to score,\" Harry recited. \"So -- that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn't it?\" ",
        "\"What's basketball?\" said Oliver Wood curiously. ",
        "\"Never mind,\" said Harry quickly. ",
        "\"Now, there's another player on each side who's called the Keeper -- I'm Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.\" ",
        "\"Three Chasers, one Keeper,\" said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. \"And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?\" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box. ",
        "\"I'll show you now,\" said Oliver Wood. \"Take this.\" ",
        "He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat. ",
        "\"I'm going to show you what the Bludgers do,\" Oliver Wood said. \"These two are the Bludgers.\" ",
        "He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the Quafflethe Quaffle. Harry noticed ",
        "that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding they inside the box. ",
        "\"Stand back,\" Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers. ",
        "At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry's face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking Harry nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air -- it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground. ",
        "\"See?\" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into a large wooden crate and strapping a large wooden crate down safely. \"the Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off players brooms. That's why you have the Beaters -- the Weasley twins are ours -- it's the Weasley twins job to protect the Weasley twins side from the Bludgers and try and knock the Weasley twins toward the other team. So -- think you've got all that?\" ",
        "\"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from the Beaters ,\" Harry reeled off. ",
        "\"Very good,\" said Oliver Wood. ",
        "\"Er -- have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\" Harry asked, hoping Harry sounded offhand. ",
        "\"Never at Hogwarts. We've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That's you. And you don't have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers -- \" ",
        "\" -- unless they crack my head open.\" ",
        "\"Don't worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers -- I mean, the Weasleys're like a pair of the Bludgers.\" ",
        "Wood reached into a large wooden crate and took out the fourth and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, \" ",
        "Wood was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. \" ",
        "Wood was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings. ",
        "\"This,\" said \" ",
        "Wood, \"is the Golden Snitch, and it's the most important ball of the lot. It's very hard to catch because it's so fast and difficult to see. It's the Seeker's job to catch it. You've got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Golden Snitch wins the Golden Snitch team an extra hundred and fifty points, so the Golden Snitch nearly always win. That's why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Golden Snitch is caught, so the Golden Snitch can go on for ages -- I think the record is three months, the Golden Snitch had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep. ",
        "\"Well, that's it -- any questions?\" ",
        "Harry shook Harry head. Harry understood what Harry had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem. ",
        "\"We won't practice with the Golden Snitch yet,\" said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside a large wooden crate, \"it's too dark, We might lose it. Let's try you out with a few of these.\" ",
        "Harry pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of Harry pocket and a few minutes later, Harry and Harry were up in the air, \" ",
        "Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as Harry could in every direction for Harry to catch. ",
        "Harry didn't miss a single one, and \" ",
        "Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and he and Harry couldn't carry on. ",
        "\"That Quidditch Cup'll have our name on it this year,\" said \" ",
        "Wood happily as he and Harry trudged back up to the castle. \"I wouldn't be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and Charlie Weasley could have played for England if Charlie Weasley hadn't gone off chasing dragons.\" ",
        "Perhaps it was because Charlie Weasley was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all Charlie Weasley homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when Harry realized that Harry'd already been at Hogwarts two months. the castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. Harry lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that His lessons had mastered the basics. ",
        "On Halloween morning His lessons woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that Professor Flitwick thought His lessons were ready to start making objects fly, something His lessons had all been dying to try since His lessons'd seen Professor Flitwick make Neville's toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch Neville eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. Hermione hadn't spoken to either of Ron or Hermione was angrier about this since the day his new broomstick had arrived. ",
        "\"Now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!\" squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of Professor Flitwick pile of books as usual. \"Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too -- never  ",
        "forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on himself chest.\" ",
        "It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather Harry and Seamus were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that Seamus prodded the desktop with Seamus wand and set fire to it -- Harry had to put it out with Harry hat. ",
        "Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck. ",
        "\"Wingardium Leviosal\" Ron shouted, waving Ron long arms like a windmill. ",
        "\"You're saying his long arms wrong,Harry heard Hermione snap. \"It's Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the 'gar' nice and long.\" ",
        "\"You do it, then, if you're so clever,\" Ron snarled. ",
        "Hermione rolled up the sleeves of Hermione gown, flicked his wand, and said, \"Wingardium LeviosaV' ",
        "Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above Their heads. ",
        "\"Oh, well done!\" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. \"Everyone see here, Miss Granger's done it!Ron Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. ",
        "\"It's no wonder no one can stand her,\" Ron said to Harry as they pushed they way into the crowded corridor, \"her's a nightmare, honestly.\" ",
        "Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past Someone. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of Hermione face -- and was startled to see that Hermione was in tears. ",
        "\"I think Hermione heard you.\" ",
        "\"So?\" said Ron, but Ron looked a bit uncomfortable. \"Hermione must've noticed Hermione's got no friends.\" ",
        "Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon. On no friends way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling Hermione friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later Harry and Ron had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of Harry and Ron minds. ",
        "A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. the Halloween feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as the Halloween feast had at the start-of-term banquet. ",
        "Harry was just helping Harry to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the Great Hall, Harry turban askew and terror on Harry face. Everyone stared as Harry reached Professor Dumbledore's chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, \"Troll -- in the dungeons -- thought you ought to know.\" ",
        "Harry then sank to the floor in a dead faint. ",
        "There was an uproar. an uproar took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence. ",

        "\"How could a troll get in?\" Harry asked as a troll climbed the stairs. ",
        "\"Don't ask me, a troll're supposed to be really stupid,\" said Ron. \"Maybe Peeves let Peeves in for a Halloween joke.\" ",
        "a troll passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As a troll jostled a troll way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron's arm. ",
        "\"I've just thought -- Hermione.\" ",
        "\"What about Hermione?\" ",
        "\"Hermione doesn't know about the troll.Ron Ron bit Ron lip. ",
        "\"Oh, all right,\" Ron snapped. \"But Percy'd better not see us.\" ",
        "Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls' bathroom. they had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind they. ",
        "\"Percy!\" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin. ",
        "Peering around a large stone griffin, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. Percy crossed a deserted side corridor and disappeared from view. ",
        "\"What's Percy doing?\" Harry whispered. \"Why isn't Percy down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?\" ",
        "\"Search me.\" ",
        "Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape 's fading footsteps. ",
        "\"Percy's heading for the third floor,\" Harry said, but Ron held up Percy hand. ",
        "\"Can you smell something?Harry Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached Harry nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean. ",
        "And then they heard no one -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed -- at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward they. they shrank into the shadows and watched as the shadows emerged into a patch of moonlight. ",
        "the shadows was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, the shadows skin was a dull, granite gray, the shadows great lumpy body like a boulder with the shadows small bald head perched on top like a coconut. the shadows had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from the shadows was incredible. The smell coming from it was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the third floor because The smell coming from it arms were so long. ",
        "the troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. the troll waggled the troll long ears, making up the troll tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room. ",
        "\"The key's in the lock,\" Harry muttered. \"We could lock the troll in.\" ",
        "\"Good idea,\" said Ron nervously. ",
        "the troll edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't about to come out of the troll. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the open door, and lock the key. ",
        "\"Yes!\" ",
        "Flushed with the troll victory, the troll started to run back up the passage, but as the troll reached the corner the troll heard something that made the troll hearts stop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming from the chamber the troll'd just chained up. ",
        "\"Oh, no,\" said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron. ",
        "\"It's the girls' bathroom!\" Harry gasped. ",
        "\" Hermionel\" they said together. ",
        "It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the open door and turned the key, fumbling in they panic. Harry pulled the open door open and they ran inside. ",
        "Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if Hermione Granger was about to faint. the troll was advancing on Hermione Granger, knocking the sinks off the walls as the troll went. ",
        "\"Confuse it!\" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, Harry threw a tap as hard as Harry could against the wall. ",
        "the troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. the troll lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. the troll mean little eyes saw Harry. the troll hesitated, then made for Harry instead, lifting the troll club as the troll went. ",

        "\"So why did Snape's a Hogwarts teacher just try and kill Harry?\" cried Hermione. ",
        "The afternoon's events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape. ",
        "\"I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I've read all about them! You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking at all, I saw Snape!\" ",
        "\"I'm tellin' yeh, yer wrong!\" said Hagrid hotly. \"I don' know why Harry's broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn' try an' kill a student! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh -- yer meddlin' in things that don' concern yeh. It's dangerous.

The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that the Weasley twins followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of Quirrell turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail could fly off again. ",
        "No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape's classes down in the dungeons, where Professor Snape's classes breath rose in a mist before Professor Snape's classes and Professor Snape's classes kept as close as possible to Professor Snape's classes hot cauldrons. ",
        "\"I do feel so sorry,\" said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, \"for all those people who have to stay at ",
        "Hogwarts for Christmas because all those people who have to stay at ",
        "Hogwarts for Christmas're not wanted at home.\" ",
        "Quirrell was looking over at Harry as Quirrell spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lion-fish, ignored Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lion-fish. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, Malfoy had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then Malfoy'd realized that nobody found this funny, because nobody were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on Malfoy bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family. ",
        "It was true that Harry wasn't going back to Privet Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. Professor McGonagall didn't feel sorry for Professor McGonagall at all; this would probably be the best Christmas Professor McGonagall'd ever had. Ron and Ron brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie. ",
        "When Ron and his brothers left the dungeons at the end of Potions, Ron and his brothers found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told Two enormous feet that Hagrid was behind Hagrid. ",
        "\"Hi, Hagrid, want any help?\" Ron asked, sticking Ron head through the branches. ",
        "\"Nah, I'm all right, thanks, Ron.\" ",
        "\"Would you mind moving out of the way?\" came Malfoy's cold drawl from behind them. \"Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose -- that hut of Hagrid's must seem like a palace compared to what your family's used to.Ron Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.

        "\"WEASLEY!Ron Ron let go of the front of Malfoy's robes. ",
        "\"Ron was provoked, Snape,\" said Hagrid, sticking Ron huge hairy face out from behind a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. \"Malfoy was insultin' Ron family.\" ",
        "\"Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,\" said Snape silkily. \"Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn't more. Move along, all of you.\" ",
        "Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead, scattering needles everywhere and smirking. ",
        "\"I'll get Crabbe, and Goyle,\" said Ron, grinding Ron teeth at Malfoy's back, \"one of these days, I'll get Crabbe, and Goyle -- \" ",
        "\"I hate them both,\" said Harry, \"Malfoy and Snape.\" ",
        "\"Come on, cheer up, it's nearly Christmas,\" said Hagrid. \"Tell yeh what, come with me an' see the Great Hall, looks a treat.\" ",
        "So the three of them followed Hagrid and Hagrid tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations. ",
        "\"Ah, Hagrid, the last tree -- put it in the far corner, would you?\" ",
        "the Great Hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles. ",
        "\"How many days you got left until yer holidays?\" Hagrid asked. ",
        "\"Just one,\" said Hermione. \"And that reminds me -- thanks, Ron, we've got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.\" ",
        "\"Oh yeah, you're right,\" said Ron, tearing Ron eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of her wand and was trailing thanks, Ron over the branches of the new tree. ",
        "\"The library?\" said Hagrid, following thanks, Ron out of the Great Hall. \"Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren't yeh?\" ",
        "\"Oh, we're not working,\" Harry told Harry brightly. ",
        "\"Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we've been trying to find out who Harry is.\" ",
        "\"You what?\" Hagrid looked shocked. \"Listen here -- I've told yeh -- drop it. It's nothin' to you what that dog's guardin'.\" ",
        "\"We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all,\" said Hermione. ",
        "\"Unless you'd like to tell We and save We the trouble?\" Harry added. \"We must've been through hundreds of books already and We can't find Nicolas Flamel anywhere -- just ",
        "give We a hint -- I know I've read Nicolas Flamel name somewhere.\" ",
        "\"I'm sayin' nothin',\" said Hagrid flatly. ",
        "\"Just have to find out for We, then,\" said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library. ",
        "they had indeed been searching books for Flamel's name ever since Hagrid had let Hagrid slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Nicolas Flamel might have done to get Nicolas Flamel into a book. Nicolas Flamel wasn't in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time ; Nicolas Flamel was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows. ",
        "Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles Hermione had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. Harry had been wondering for a while if Nicolas Flamel wasn't somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and Harry knew Harry'd never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts. ",
        "\"What are you looking for, boy?\" ",
        "\"Nothing,\" said Harry. ",
        "Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at a feather duster. ",
        "\"You'd better get out, then. Go on -- out!\" ",
        "Wishing Harry'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library. Harry, Ron and his brothers had already agreed Ron and his brothers'd better not ask Madam Pince where Ron and his brothers could find Nicolas Flamel. He, Ron, and Hermione were sure Madam Pince'd be able to tell Ron and his brothers, but He, Ron, and Hermione couldn't risk Snape hearing what He, Ron, and Hermione were up to. ",
        "Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but Harry wasn't very hopeful. He, Ron, and Hermione had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as He, Ron, and Hermione only had odd moments between lessons it wasn't surprising He, Ron, and Hermione'd found nothing. What He, Ron, and Hermione really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down He, Ron, and Hermione necks. ",
        "Five minutes later, Ron and his brothers joined Ron, shaking Ron and his brothers heads. Ron and his brothers went off to lunch. ",
        "\"You will keep looking while I'm away, won't you?\" said Hermione. \"And send me an owl if you find anything.\" ",
        "\"And you could ask your parents if your parents know who Flamel is,\" said Ron. \"It'd be safe to ask Ron and his brothers.\" ",
        "\"Very safe, as Ron and his brothers're both dentists,\" said Hermione. ",
        "Once the holidays had started, Ron and his brothers were having too good a time to think much about Nicolas Flamel. Ron and his brothers had the dormitory to Ron and his brothers and the common room was far emptier than usual, so Ron and his brothers were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. Ron and his brothers sat by the hour eating anything Ron and his brothers could spear on a toasting fork -- bread, English muffins, ",
        "marshmallows -- and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if Ron and his brothers wouldn't work. ",
        "Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron's set was very old and battered. Like everything else Ron owned, Ron's set had once belonged to someone else in Ron family -- in this case, Ron grandfather. However, old chessmen weren't a drawback at all. Ron knew old chessmen so well Ron never had trouble getting old chessmen to do what Ron wanted. ",
        "Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent Ron, and old chessmen didn't trust Ron at all. Ron wasn't a very good player yet and old chessmen kept shouting different bits of advice at Ron, which was confusing. \"Don't send me there, can't you see Ron knight? Send Ron, we can afford to lose Ron.\" ",
        "On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When Harry woke early in the morning, however, the first thing Harry saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of Harry bed. ",
        "\"Merry Christmas,\" said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on Ron bathrobe. ",
        "\"You, too,\" said Harry. \"Will you look at this? I've got some presents!\" ",
        "\"What did you expect, turnips?\" said Ron, turning to Ron own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry's. ",
        "Harry picked up the top parcel. the top parcel was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across the top parcel was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden ",
        "flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it Hagrid. Harry blew it -- it sounded a bit like an owl. ",
        "A second, very small parcel contained a note. ",
        "We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to a note was a fifty-pence piece. ",
        "\"That's friendly,\" said Harry. ",
        "Ron was fascinated by a fifty-pence piece. ",
        "\" Weird\\ \" Ron said, \"What a shape! This is money?\" ",
        "\"You can keep it,\" said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. \"Hagrid and my aunt and uncle -- so who sent these?\" ",
        "\"I think I know who that one's from,\" said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. \"My mom. I told My mom you didn't expect any presents and -- oh, no,\" Ron groaned, \"My mom's made you a Weasley sweater.\" ",
        "Harry had torn open a very lumpy parcel to find a thick, hand- knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge. ",
        "\"Every year My mom makes you a Weasley sweater,\" said Ron, unwrapping Ron own, \"and mine's always maroon.\" ",
        "\"That's really nice of My mom,\" said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty. ",
        "Harry next present also contained candy -- a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione. ",
        "This only left one parcel. Harry picked This up and felt This. This was very light. Harry unwrapped This. ",
        "Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where This lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped. ",
        "\"I've heard of those,\" Ron said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans Ron'd gotten from Hermione. \"If that's what I think it is -- that's what I think it is're really rare, and really valuable.\" ",
        "\"What is it?\" ",
        "Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material. ",
        "\"It's an Invisibility Cloak,\" said Ron, a look of awe on his face. \"I'm sure it is -- try it on.\" ",
        "Harry threw the cloak around Harry shoulders and Ron gave a yell. ",
        "\"It is! Look down!\" ",
        "Harry looked down at Harry feet, but they were gone. Harry dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, Harry reflection looked back at Harry, just Harry head suspended in midair, Harry body completely invisible. Harry pulled the cloak his head and his reflection vanished completely. ",
        "\"There's a note!\" said Ron suddenly. \"A note fell out of A note!\" ",
        "Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy writing \" ",
        "Harry had never seen before were the following words: ",
        "Your father left this in my possession before Your father died. It is time it was returned to you. ",
        "Use it well. ",
        "A Very Merry Christmas to you. ",
        "There was no signature. Harry stared at a note. Ron was admiring the cloak. ",
        "\"I'd give Anuthinq for one of these,\" Ron said. \"Anuthinq. What's the matter?\" ",
        "\"Nothing,\" said Harry. Ron felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to Your father? ",
        "Before Ron could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. Harry didn't feel like sharing it with anyone else yet. ",
        "\"Merry Christmas!\" ",
        "\"Hey, look -- Harry's got a George Weasley sweater, too!\" ",
        "Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G. ",
        "\"Harry's is better than ours, though,\" said Fred, holding up a Weasley sweater. \"She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family.\" ",
        "\"Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?\" George demanded. \"Come on, get it on, they're lovely and warm.\" ",
        "\"I hate maroon,\" Ron moaned halfheartedly as Ron pulled it over his head. ",
        "\"You haven't got a letter on yours,\" George observed. ",
        "\"I suppose She thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid -- we know we're called Gred and Forge.\" ",
        "\"What's all this noise?\" ",
        "George Weasley stuck George Weasley through the dormitory door, looking disapproving. George Weasley had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping George Weasley presents as George Weasley, too, carried a lumpy sweater over George Weasley arm, which Fred seized. ",
        "\"P for prefect! Get \"P for prefect on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing we, Harry Harry got one.\" ",
        "\"I -- don't -- want -- \" said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over Percy , knocking Percy glasses askew. ",
        "\"And you're not sitting with the prefects today, either,\" said George. \"\"Merry Christmas is a time for family.\" ",
        "They frog-marched Percy from the room, Percy arms pinned to Percy side by Percy . ",
        "Harry had never in all Harry life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce -- and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with These fantastic party favors little plastic toys and These fantastic party favors flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and a wizard cracker didn't just bang, a wizard cracker went off with a blast like a cannon and  ",
        "engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped Dumbledore pointed wizard's hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read Professor Flitwick. ",
        "Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke Percy teeth on a silver Sickle embedded in Percy slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as Harry called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry's amazement, giggled and blushed, Professor McGonagall top hat lopsided. ",
        "When Harry finally left the table, Harry was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of non-explodable, luminous balloons, a Grow- Your-Own-Warts kit, and Harry own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling The white mice were going to end up as Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner. ",
        "Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, Harry and the Weasleys returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in Harry new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. Harry suspected Harry wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help Harry so much. ",
        "After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower because they'd stolen his prefect badge. ",
        "It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of Harry mind ",
        "Harry's best Christmas day ever. Not until Harry climbed into bed was Harry free to think about Not until he climbed into bed: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had sent Not until he climbed into bed. ",
        "Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother Harry, fell asleep almost as soon as Harry'd drawn the curtains of Harry four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of Harry own bed and pulled the cloak out from under the cloak. ",
        "Your father's ... this had been Your father's. Harry let the material flow over Harry hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, a note had said. ",
        "Harry had to try it, now. Harry slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around Harry. Looking down at Harry legs, Harry saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling. ",
        "Use It well. ",
        "Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to Harry in the cloak. Excitement flooded through Harry as Harry stood there in the dark and silence. Harry could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know. ",
        "Ron grunted in Ron sleep. Should Harry wake Harry? Something held Harry back -- Your father-- Harry felt that this time -- the first time -- Harry wanted to use it alone. ",
        "Harry crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole. ",
        "\"Who's there?\" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. Harry walked quickly down the corridor. ",
        "Where should Harry go? Harry stopped, Harry heart racing, and thought. And then it came to Harry. The Restricted Section in the library. Harry'd be able to read as long as Harry liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. Harry set off, drawing the cloak tight around Harry as Harry walked. ",
        "the library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see Harry way along the rows of books. a lamp looked as if a lamp was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel Harry arm supporting a lamp, the sight gave Harry the creeps. ",
        "The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, Harry held up a lamp to read the titles. ",
        "They didn't tell Harry much. They peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn't understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on One book that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry's neck prickled. Maybe Harry was imagining it, maybe not, but Harry thought a faint whispering was coming from these books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be. ",
        "Harry had to start somewhere. Setting a lamp down carefully on the floor, Harry looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting-looking book. A large black and silver volume caught Harry eye. Harry pulled his eye out with difficulty, because his eye was very heavy, and, balancing his eye on Harry knee, let his eye fall open. ",
        "A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- One book was screaming! Harry snapped One book shut, but bloodcurdling shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. Harry stumbled backward and knocked over Harry lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, Harry  ",
        "heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside -- stuffing One book back on the bottom shelf, Harry ran for One book. Harry passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild eyes looked straight through Harry, and Harry slipped under Filch's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, One book's shrieks still ringing in Harry ears.

        "Harry came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. Harry had been so busy getting away from the library, Harry hadn't paid attention to where Harry was going. Perhaps because it was dark, Harry didn't recognize where Harry was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, Harry knew, but Harry must be five floors above there. ",

        "The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and Harry stared hungrily back at The Potters, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though Harry was hoping to fall right through the glass and reach The Potters. Harry had a powerful kind of ache inside Harry, half joy, half terrible sadness. ",
        "How long Harry stood there, Harry didn't know. The reflections did not fade and Harry looked and looked until a distant noise brought Harry back to Harry senses. Harry couldn't stay here, Harry had to find Harry way back to ",
        "bed. Harry tore Harry eyes away from Harry mother's face, whispered, \"I'll come back,\" and hurried from the room. ",
        "\"You could have woken me up,\" said Ron, crossly. ",
        "\"You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet.\" ",
        "\"I'd like to see your mom and dad,\" Ron said eagerly. ",
        "\"And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.\" ",
        "\"You can see your other brothers and everyone any old time,\" said Ron. \"Just come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe my house only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren't you eating anything?\" ",
        "Harry couldn't eat. \" ",
        "Harry had seen \" ",
        "Harry parents and would be seeing his parents again tonight. \" ",
        "Harry had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn't seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three-headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really? ",
        "\"Are you all right?\" said Ron. \"You look odd.\" ",
        "What Harry feared most was that Harry might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. they tried retracing Harry's route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour. ",
        "\"I'm freezing,\" said Ron. \"Let's forget it and go back.\" ",
        "\"IVo!\" Harry hissed. \"I know it's here somewhere.\" ",
        "they passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else. Just as Ron started moaning that Ron feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor. ",
        "\"It's here -- just here -- yes!\" ",
        "they pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around Harry shoulders and ran to a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. ",
        "There they were. Harry mother and father beamed at the sight of Harry. ",
        "\"See?\" Harry whispered. ",
        "\"I can't see anything.\" ",
        "\"Look! Look at them all ... there are loads of them. ...\" \"I can only see you.\" ",
        "\"Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.\" ",
        "Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet, Harry couldn't see his family anymore, Ron in front of the mirror. ",
        "Ron, though, was staring transfixed at Ron image. \"Look at Ron!\" Ron said. ",
        "\"Can you see his family standing around you?\" ",
        "\"No -- I'm alone -- but I'm different -- I look older -- and I'm Head Boy!\" ",
        "\"What?\" ",
        "\"I am -- I'm wearing the badge like Bill used to -- and I'm holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup -- I'm Quidditch captain, too!\" ",
        "Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry. ",
        "\"Do you think a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet shows the future?\" ",
        "\"How can a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet? his family are dead -- let me have another look -- \" ",
        "\"You had a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.\" ",
        "\"You're only holding the Quidditch Cup, what's interesting about that? I want to see my parents.\" ",
        "\"Don't push me -- \" ",
        "A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion. their hadn't realized how loudly their had been talking. ",
        "\"Quick!\" ",
        "Ron threw the cloak back over their as his eyes came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, Ron and Harry thinking the same thing -- did the the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, Mrs. Norris turned and left. ",
        "\"This isn't safe -- Mrs. Norris might have gone for Filch, I bet Mrs. Norris heard us. Come on.\" ",
        "And Ron pulled Harry out of the room. ",
        "The snow still hadn't melted the next morning. ",
        "\"Want to play chess, Harry?\" said Ron. ",
        "\"No.\" ",
        "\"Why don't us go down and visit Hagrid?\" ",
        "\"No ... you go ...\" ",
        "\"I know what you're thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don't go back tonight.\" ",
        "\"Why not?\" ",
        "\"I dunno, I've just got a bad feeling about it -- and anyway, you've had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris can't see you? What if Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris walk into you? What if you knock something over?\" ",
        "\"You sound like Hermione.\" ",
        "\"I'm serious, Harry, don't go.\" ",
        "But Harry only had one thought in Harry head, which was to get back in front of a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet, and Ron wasn't going to stop Harry. ",
        "That third night Ron found Ron way more quickly than before. Ron was walking so fast Ron knew Ron was making more noise than was wise, but Ron didn't meet anyone. ",
        "And there were Ron mother and father smiling at Ron again, and one of Ron grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was nothing to stop Ron from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all. ",
        "Except -- ",
        "\"So -- back again, Harry?\" ",
        "Harry felt as though Harry insides had turned to ice. Harry looked behind Harry. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past Harry, so desperate to get to the mirror Harry hadn't noticed Harry. ",
        "\"I -- I didn't see you, sir.\" ",
        "\"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,\" said Albus Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that Harry was smiling. ",
        "\"So,\" said Albus Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, \"you, like hundreds before Harry, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.\" ",
        "\"I didn't know it was called that, sir.\" ",
        "\"But I expect you've realized by now what it does?\" ",
        "\"It -- well -- It shows me my family -- \" ",
        "\"And It showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.\" ",
        "\"How did you know -- ?\" ",
        "\"I don't need a cloak to become invisible,\" said Albus Dumbledore gently. \"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised Erised shows us all?\" ",
        "Harry shook \" ",
        "Harry head. ",
        "\"Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised Erised like a normal mirror, that is, The happiest man on earth would look into the Mirror of Erised and see The happiest man on earth exactly as The happiest man on earth is. Does that help?\" ",
        "Harry thought. Then Harry said slowly, \"It shows us what us want ... whatever us want ...\" ",
        "\"Yes and no,\" said Albus Dumbledore quietly. \"It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of us hearts. You, who have never known his family, see his family standing around his family. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees his standing alone, the best of all of Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers. However, the Mirror of Erised will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before the Mirror of Erised, entranced by what Men have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what the Mirror of Erised shows is real or even possible. ",
        "\"the Mirror of Erised will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again. If you ever do run across the Mirror of Erised, you will now be prepared. the Mirror of Erised does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don't you put the Invisibility Cloak back on and get off to bed?\" ",
        "Harry stood up. ",
        "\"Sir -- Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?\" ",
        "\"Obviously, you've just done so,Albus Dumbledore smiled. \"You may ask me one more thing, however.\" ",
        "\"What do you see when you look in the Mirror of Erised?\" ",
        "\"I? I see Albus Dumbledore holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\" ",
        "Harry stared. ",
        "\"One can never have enough socks,\" said Albus Dumbledore. \"Another Christmas has come and gone ",
        "and I didn't get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.\" ",
        "It was only when Albus Dumbledore was back in bed that it struck Harry that Albus Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, Albus Dumbledore thought, as Albus Dumbledore shoved Scabbers off Albus Dumbledore pillow, it had been quite a personal question. ",
        "Albus Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the Invisibility Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of Harry trunk. Harry wished Harry could forget what Harry'd seen in the Mirror of Erised as easily, but Harry couldn't. Harry started having nightmares. Over and over again Harry dreamed about Harry parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter. ",
        "\"You see, Albus Dumbledore was right, the Mirror of Erised could drive you mad,\" said Ron, when Harry told Albus Dumbledore about these dreams. ",
        "Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (\"If Filch had caught you!\"), and disappointment that Filch hadn't at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was. ",
        "They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure Filch'd read the name somewhere. Once term had started, They were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during They breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again. ",
        "Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn't dampen Harry spirits. The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood's side. If they won they next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the House Championship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that Harry had fewer nightmares when Harry was tired out after training. ",
        "Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. Wood'd just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms. ",
        "\"Will you stop messing around!\" Wood yelled. \"That's exactly the sort of thing that'll lose us the match! Snape's refereeing this time, and Snape'll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!\" ",
        "George Weasley really did fall off \" ",
        "George Weasley broom at these words. ",
        "\" Snape's refereeing?\" \" ",
        "George Weasley spluttered through a mouthful of mud. \"When's \" ",

        "George Weasley's not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.\" ",
        "The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too. ",
        "\"It's not my fault,\" said Wood. \"We've just got to make sure We play a clean game, so Snape hasn't got an excuse to pick on We.\" ",
        "Which was all very well, thought Harry, but Snape had another reason for not wanting Snape near Snape while Snape was playing Quidditch. ... ",
        "The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where Harry found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her. ",
        "\"Don't talk to Chess for a moment,\" said Ron when Harry sat down next to Harry, \"I need to concern\" Harry caught sight of Harry's face. \"What's the matter with Harry? ",
        "You look terrible.\" ",
        "Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, ",
        "Harry told the other two about Snape 's sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee. ",
        "\"Don't play,\" said Hermione at once. ",
        "\"Say you're ill,\" said Ron. ",
        "\"Pretend to break your leg,\" Hermione suggested. ",
        "\" Really break your leg,\" said Ron. ",
        "\"I can't,\" said Harry. \"There isn't a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can't play at all.\" ",
        "At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How Neville had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because Neville legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. Neville must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower. ",
        "Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville's legs sprang apart and Neville got to Neville feet, trembling. ",
        "\"What happened?\" Hermione asked Neville, leading Neville over to sit with Harry and Ron. ",
        "\"Malfoy,\" said Neville shakily. \"I met Neville outside the library. Neville said Neville'd been looking for someone to practice that on.\" ",
        "\"Go to Professor McGonagall!\" Hermione urged Neville. \"Report Neville!\" ",
        "Neville shook Neville head. ",
        "\"I don't want more trouble,\" Neville mumbled. ",
        "\"You've got to stand up to Neville, Neville!\" said Ron. \"Neville's used to walking all over people, but that's no reason to lie down in front of Neville and make it easier.\" ",
        "\"There's no need to tell me I'm not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy's already done that,\" Neville choked out. ",
        "Harry felt in the pocket of Harry robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given Harry for Another Christmas. Harry gave it to Neville, who looked as though Harry might cry. ",
        "\"You're worth twelve of Malfoy,\" Harry said. \"The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn't it? And where's Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.\" ",
        "Neville's lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog. ",
        "\"Thanks, Harry ... I think I'll go to bed. ... D'you want the card, you collect the card, don't you?\" ",
        "As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the card. ",
        "\"Dumbledore again,\" Harry said, \"Harry was the first one I ever -- \" ",
        "Harry gasped. Harry stared at the back of the card. Then Harry looked up at Ron and Hermione. ",
        "\"I've found him\\\" Harry whispered. \"I've found Flamel! I told you I'd read the name somewhere before, I read the name on the train coming here -- listen to this: ",
        "'Albus Dumbledore is particularly famous for Albus Dumbledore defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and dragon work on alchemy with dragon partner, Nicolas Flamel'V' ",
        "Hermione jumped to his feet. her hadn't looked so excited since they'd gotten back the marks for they very first piece of homework. ",
        "\"Stay there!\" her said, and her sprinted up the stairs to the girls' dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before her was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms. ",
        "\"I never thought to look in here!\" her whispered excitedly. \"I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.\" ",
        "\"Light?\" said Ron, but Hermione told Ron to be quiet until her'd looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to her. ",
        "At last her found what her was looking for. ",
        "\"I knew it! I knew it!\" ",
        "\"Are we allowed to speak yet?\" said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored Ron. ",
        "\"Nicolas Flamel,\" her whispered dramatically, \"is the only known maker of the Sorcerer's Stone\\\" ",
        "This didn't have quite the effect her'd expected. ",
        "\"The what?\" said Harry and Ron. ",
        "\"Oh, honestly , don't you two read? Look -- read that, there.\" ",
        "her pushed the book toward Harry and Ron, and Harry and Ron read: ",
        "The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The Stone will transform any metal into pure gold. The Stone also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal. ",
        "There have been many reports of the Sorcerer's Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight). ",
        "\"See?\" said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. \"The dog must be guarding Flamel's Sorcerer's Stone! I bet Flamel's Sorcerer's Stone asked Albus Dumbledore to keep The dog safe for Flamel's Sorcerer's Stone, because they're friends and Flamel's Sorcerer's Stone knew someone was after it, that's why Flamel's Sorcerer's Stone wanted The Stone moved out of Gringotts!\" ",
        "\"A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!\" said Harry. \"No wonder Snape's after it! ",
        "Anyone would want it.\" ",
        "\"And no wonder we couldn't find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,\" said Ron. \"Ron's not exactly recent if Ron's six hundred and sixty-five, is Ron?\" ",
        "The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what Harry and Ron'd do with The Stone if Harry and Ron had one. It wasn't until Ron said Ron'd buy Ron own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match. ",
        "\"I'm going to play,\" Ron told Ron and Hermione. \"If I don't, all the Slytherins will think I'm just too scared to face Snape. I'll show all the Slytherins ... it'll really wipe the smiles off all the Slytherins faces if we win.\" ",
        "\"Just as long as we're not wiping you off the field,\" said Hermione. ",
        "As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever Harry told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn't too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the House Championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would Ron and Hermione be allowed to, with such a biased referee? ",
        "Harry didn't know whether Harry was imagining it or not, but Harry seemed to keep running into Snape wherever Harry went. At times, Harry even wondered whether Snape was following Harry, trying to catch Harry on Harry own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they'd found out about The Stone? Harry didn't see how Harry could -- yet Harry sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds. ",
        "Harry knew, when they wished Harry good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether Ron and Hermione'd ever see Harry alive again. This wasn't what you'd call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood's pep talk as Harry pulled on his robes and picked up Harry Nimbus Two Thousand. ",
        "Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn't understand why Ron and Hermione looked so grim and worried, or why Ron and Hermione had Ron and Hermione brought Ron and Hermione wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. Ron and Hermione'd gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if Snape showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry. ",
        "\"Now, don't forget, it's Locomotor Mortis,\" Hermione muttered as Ron slipped Ron wand up Ron sleeve. ",
        "\"I know,\" Ron snapped. \"Don't nag.\" ",
        "Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside. ",
        "\"Don't want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it's now. Finish ",
        "the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.\" ",
        "\"The whole school's out there!\" said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. \"Even -- blimey -- Albus Dumbledore's come to watch!\" ",
        "Harry's heart did a somersault. ",
        "Albus Dumbledore?\" Albus Dumbledore said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard. ",
        "Harry could have laughed out loud with relief. Harry was safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt Harry if Albus Dumbledore was watching. ",
        "Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too. ",
        "\"I've never seen Snape look so mean,\" Snape told Hermione. \"Look -- they're off. Ouch!\" ",
        "Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy. ",
        "\"Oh, sorry, Fred Weasley, didn't see you there.\" ",
        "Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle. ",
        "\"Wonder how long Potter's going to stay on Potter broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Fred Weasley?\" ",
        "Ron didn't answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because Fred Weasley had hit a Bludger at Fred Weasley. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, ",
        "who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch. ",
        "\"You know how I think they choose people for the team?\" said \" ",
        "Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. \"It's people they feel sorry for. ",
        "See, there's Potter, who's got no parents, then there's the Weasleys, who've got no money -- you should be on the team, Longbottom, you've got no brains.\" ",
        "Neville went bright red but turned in Neville seat to face \" ",
        "Malfoy. ",
        "\"I'm worth twelve of you, \" ",
        "Malfoy,\" Neville stammered. ",
        "Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take Ron eyes from the game, said, \"You tell Ron, Neville.\" ",
        "\"Longbottom, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than Fred Weasley, and that's saying something.\" ",
        "Ron's nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry. ",
        "\"I'm warning you, Malfoy -- one more word -- \" ",
        "\"Ron!\" said Hermione suddenly, \"Harry -- !\" ",
        "\"What? Where?\" ",
        "Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, Hermione crossed fingers in Hermione mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet. ",
        "\"You're in luck, Fred Weasley, Potter's obviously spotted some money on the ground!\" said \" ",
        "Malfoy. ",
        "Ron snapped. Before \" ",
        "Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of Ron, wrestling Ron to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help. ",
        "\"Come on, Harry!\" Hermione screamed, leaping onto his seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape -- her didn't even notice \" ",
        "Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle. ",
        "Up in the air, Snape turned on Snape broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past Snape, missing Snape by inches -- the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, Harry arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in Harry hand. ",
        "The stands erupted; The stands had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly. ",
        "\"Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game's over! Harry's won! We've won! Gryffindor is in the lead!\" shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on Gryffindor and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front. ",
        "Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. Harry couldn't believe it. Harry'd done it -- The game was over; The game had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, Harry saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped -- then Harry felt a hand on Harry shoulder and looked up into Albus Dumbledore's smiling face. ",
        "\"Well done,\" said Albus Dumbledore quietly, so that Harry could hear. \"Nice to see you haven't been brooding about that mirror . . . been keeping busy . . . excellent ...\" ",

        "Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take Snape Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. Snape couldn't ever remember feeling happier. Snape'd really done something to be proud of now -- no one could say Snape was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. Snape walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in Snape head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift Snape onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.

        "Harry had reached the shed. Harry leaned against the door and looked up at Hogwarts, with the door windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. Harry'd done it, Harry'd shown Snape. ... ",

Norbert couldn't see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. they were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the Invisibility Cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest Astronomy Tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and Add Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak might as well be packing Add Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak bags already. ",

You fed Malfoy some cock-and- bull story about a dragon, trying to get Malfoy out of bed and into trouble. I've already caught Malfoy.

It's not exactly a secret we hate Snape, Dumbledore 'll think we made it up to get Dumbledore sacked. Filch wouldn't help we if Filch life depended on his life, Filch's too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, Filch'll think.

        "\"Don't you call me an idiot!\" said Neville. \"I don't think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!\" ",
        "\"Yes, but not to us,\" said Harry in exasperation. ",
        "Neville, you don't know what you're doing.\" ",
        "Snape took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight. ",
        "\"Go on then, try and hit me!\" said Neville, raising Neville fists. \"I'm ready!\" ",
        "Harry turned to Hermione. ",
        "\"Do something,\" Harry said desperately. ",
        "Hermione stepped forward. ",
        "Neville,\" Hermione said, \"I'm really, really sorry about this.\" Hermione raised Hermione wand. ",
        "\"Petrificus Totalusl\" Hermione cried, pointing \"Petrificus Totalusl at Neville. ",
        "Neville's arms snapped to Neville sides. Neville legs sprang together. Neville whole body rigid, Neville swayed where Neville stood and then fell flat on Neville face, stiff as a board. ",
        "Hermione ran to turn Neville over. Neville's jaws were jammed together so Neville couldn't speak. Only Neville eyes were moving, looking at Only his eyes in horror. ",
        "\"What've you done to Neville?\" Harry whispered. ",
        "\"It's the full Body-Bind,\" said Hermione miserably. \"Oh, Neville, I'm so sorry.\" ",
        "\"We had to, Neville, no time to explain,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"You'll understand later, Neville,\" said Harry as they stepped over Harry and pulled on the cloak. ",
        "But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a very good omen. In they nervous state, every statue's shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on they. ",
        "At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top. ",
        "\"Oh, let's kick Mrs. Norris, just this once,\" Harry whispered in Harry's ear, but Harry shook Harry head. As they climbed carefully around Mrs. Norris, Mrs. Norris turned Mrs. Norris lamplike eyes on they, but didn't do anything. ",
        "they didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip. ",
        "\"Who's there?\" he said suddenly as they climbed toward he. he narrowed he . \"Know you're there, even if I can't see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\" ",
        "he rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them. ",
        "\"Should call Filch, I should, if something's a-creeping around unseen.\" ",
        "Harry had a sudden idea. ",
        "\"Peeves,\" he said, in a hoarse whisper, \"the Bloody Baron has the Bloody Baron own reasons for being invisible.\" ",
        "Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. the Bloody Baron caught the Bloody Baron in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs. ",
        "\"So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, sir,\" the Bloody Baron said greasily. \"My mistake, My mistake -- I didn't see you -- of course I didn't, you're invisible -- forgive old Peevsie old Peevsie little joke, sir.\" ",
        "\"I have business here, Peeves,\" croaked Harry. \"Stay away from this place tonight.\" ",
        "\"I will, sir, I most certainly will,\" said Peeves, rising up in the air again. \"Hope your business goes well, ",
        "the Bloody Baron, I'll not bother you.\" ",
        "And the Bloody Baron scooted off. ",
        "\"Brilliant, Harry!\" whispered Harry. ",
        "A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor -- and the door was already ajar. ",
        "\"Well, there you are,Harry Harry said quietly, \"Snape's already got past Fluffy.\" ",
        "Seeing the door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two. ",
        "\"If you want to go back, I won't blame you,\" Harry said. \"You can take the cloak, I won't need the cloak now.\" ",
        "\"Don't be stupid,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"We're coming,\" said Hermione. ",
        "Harry pushed the door open. ",
        "As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn't see their. ",
        "\"What's that at it feet?\" Hermione whispered. ",
        "\"Looks like a harp,\" said Harry. \"Snape must have left it there.\" ",
        "\"It must wake up the moment you stop playing,\" said Harry. \"Well, here goes ...\" ",
        "Snape put Hagrid's flute to Snape lips and blew. It wasn't really a tune, but from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog's growls ceased -- the dog's growls tottered on the dog's growls paws and fell to the dog's growls knees, then the dog's growls slumped to the ground, fast asleep. ",
        "\"Keep playing,Harry Harry warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. they could feel the dog's hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. ",
        "\"I think we'll be able to pull the door open,\" said Harry, peering over the dog's back. \"Want to go first, Hermione?\" ",
        "\"No, I don't!\" ",
        "\"All right.\" Harry gritted Harry teeth and stepped carefully over the dog's legs. Harry bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open. ",
        "\"What can you see?\" Hermione said anxiously. ",
        "\"Nothing -- just black -- there's no way of climbing down, we'll just have to drop.\" ",
        "Harry, who was still playing Hagrid's flute, waved at Harry to get Harry attention and pointed at Harry. ",
        "\"You want to go first? Are you sure?\" said Harry. \"I don't know how deep this thing goes. Give Hagrid's flute to Hermione so Hermione can keep Harry asleep.\" ",
        "Harry handed Hagrid's flute over. In the few seconds' silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, the dog fell back into the dog deep sleep. ",
        "Harry climbed over the dog and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom. ",
        "Harry lowered Harry through the hole until Harry was hanging on by Harry fingertips. Then Harry looked up at Harry and said, \"If anything happens to Harry, don't follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?\" ",
        "\"Right,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"See you in a minute, I hope. ...\" ",
        "And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past Harry as Harry fell down, down, down and -- ",
        "FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump Harry landed on something soft. Harry sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. his eyes felt as though Harry was sitting on some sort of plant. ",
        "\"It's okay!\" Harry called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, \"it's a soft landing, you can jump!\" ",
        "Harry followed right away. \" ",
        "Ron landed, sprawled next to Harry. ",
        "\"What's this stuff?\" were \" ",
        "Ron first words. ",
        "\"Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it's here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!\" ",
        "The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. Hermione landed on Harry's other side. ",
        "\"We must be miles under the school,\" Hermione said. ",
        "\"Lucky this plant thing's here, really,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"Lucky\\\" shrieked Hermione. \"Look at you both!\" ",
        "Hermione leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. Hermione had to struggle because the moment Hermione had landed, plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around Hermione ankles. As for Harry and Ron, Harry and Ron legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without Harry and Ron noticing. ",
        "Hermione had managed to free Hermione before plant got a firm grip on Hermione. Now Hermione watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull plant off the two boys, but the more the two boys strained against the, the tighter and faster plant wound around the two boys. ",
        "\"Stop moving!\" Hermione ordered the two boys. \"I know what this is -- it's Devil's Snare!\" ",
        "\"Oh, I'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help,\" snarled Harry, leaning back, trying to stop plant from curling around Harry neck. ",
        "\"Shut up, I'm trying to remember how to kill it!\" said Hermione. ",
        "\"Well, hurry up, I can't breathe!\" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around Harry chest. ",
        "\"Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare ... what did Professor Sprout say? -- it likes the dark and the damp -- \" ",
        "\"So light a fire!\" Harry choked. ",
        "\"Yes -- of course -- but there's no wood!\" Hermione cried, wringing her hands. ",
        "\"HAVE YOU GONE MAD?\" Harry bellowed. \"ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\" ",
        "\"Oh, right!\" said Hermione, and Hermione whipped out her wand, waved her wand, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames Hermione had used on Snape at plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening it grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled it from Wriggling and flailing bodies, and Wriggling and flailing were able to pull free. ",
        "\"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\" said Harry as Harry joined Hermione by the wall, wiping sweat off Harry face. ",
        "\"Yeah,\" said Harry, \"and Harry Harry doesn't lose Harry head in a crisis -- 'there's no wood,' honestly.\" ",
        "\"This way,\" said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward. ",
        "All they could hear apart from they footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the ",
        "heart, Harry remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards' bank. If the dragons met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon -- Norbert had been bad enough ... ",
        "\"Can you hear something?\" Harry whispered. ",
        "Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead. ",
        "\"Do you think it's a ghost?\" ",
        "\"I don't know ... sounds like wings to Harry.\" ",
        "\"There's light ahead -- I can see something moving.\" ",
        "the dragons reached the end of The passageway and saw before the dragons a brilliantly lit chamber, a brilliantly lit chamber ceiling arching high above the dragons. a brilliantly lit chamber was full of small, jewel- bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of a brilliantly lit chamber was a heavy wooden door. ",
        "\"Do you think they'll attack they if they cross the room?\" said Harry. ",
        "\"Probably,\" said Harry. \"they don't look very vicious, but I suppose if they swooped down at once . . . well, there's no other choice ... I'll run.\" ",
        "Harry took a deep breath, covered Harry face with Harry arms, and sprinted across the room. Harry expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at Harry any second, but nothing happened. Harry reached a heavy wooden door. Harry pulled the handle, but the handle was locked. ",
        "The other two followed Harry. They tugged and heaved at a heavy wooden door, but it wouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried Hermione Alohomora Charm. ",
        "\"Now what?\" said Harry. ",
        "\"These birds ... These birds can't be here just for decoration,\" said Hermione. ",
        "These birds watched These birds soaring overhead, glittering -- glittering? ",
        "\"These birds're not birds!\" Harry said suddenly. \"These birds're keys\\ Winged keys -- look carefully. So that must mean ...\" Harry looked around a brilliantly lit chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \"... yes -- look! Broomsticks! We've got to catch the key to a heavy wooden door!\" ",
        "\"But there are hundreds of them!\" ",
        "Ron examined the lock on a heavy wooden door. ",
        "\"We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one -- probably silver, like the handle.\" ",
        "They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one. ",
        "Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. Harry the youngest Seeker had a knack for spotting things other people didn't. After a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, Harry the youngest Seeker noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if a large silver key that had a bent wing had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole. ",
        "\"That one!\" Harry the youngest Seeker called to the others. \"That big one -- there -- no, there -- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\" ",
        "Harry went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off Harry broom. ",
        "\"We've got to close in on it!\" Harry called, not taking Harry eyes off a large silver key that had a bent wing with a bent wing. \"Harry, you come at it from above -- Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down -- and I'll try and catch it. Right, NOW!\" ",
        "Harry dived, Hermione rocketed upward, a large silver key that had a bent wing dodged them both, and Harry streaked after a large silver key that had a bent wing; a large silver key that had a bent wing sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned a large silver key that had a bent wing against the Stone with one hand. Harry and Hermione 's cheers echoed around a brilliantly lit chamber. ",
        "Ron and Hermione 's cheers landed quickly, and Harry ran to a heavy wooden door, the key struggling in one hand. Harry rammed a brilliantly lit chamber into the lock and turned -- a brilliantly lit chamber worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that the lock had been caught twice. ",
        "\"Ready?\" Harry asked the other two, Harry hand on a heavy wooden door handle. Ron and Hermione 's cheers nodded. Harry pulled a heavy wooden door open. ",
        "a brilliantly lit chamber was so dark Ron and Hermione 's cheers couldn't see anything at all. But as Ron and Hermione 's cheers stepped into a brilliantly lit chamber, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight. ",
        "Ron and Hermione 's cheers were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than Ron and Hermione 's cheers were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing Ron and Hermione 's cheers, way across a brilliantly lit chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Harry and Hermione shivered slightly -- the towering white chessmen had no faces. ",
        "\"Now what do we do?\" Harry whispered. ",
        "\"It's obvious, isn't it?\" said Harry. \"we've got to play we way across the room.\" ",
        "Behind the white pieces the white pieces could see another door. ",
        "\"How?\" said Hermione nervously. ",
        "\"I think,\" said Harry, \"we're going to have to be chessmen.\" ",
        "Harry walked up to a black knight and put Harry hand out to touch the knights horse. At once, the Stone sprang to life. the knights horse pawed the ground and a black knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Harry. ",
        "\"Do we -- er -- have to join you to get across?\" ",
        "a black knight nodded. Harry turned to the other two. ",
        "\"This needs thinking about. ...\" Harry said. \"I suppose we've got to take the place of three of the black pieces. ",
        "Harry, Ron and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Harry think. Finally Harry said, \"Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of Harry are that good at chess -- ",
        "\"we're not offended,\" said Harry quickly. \"Just tell we what to do.\" ",
        "\"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you go there instead of that castle.\" ",
        "\"What about you?\" ",
        "\"I'm going to be a knight,\" said Harry. ",
        "The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned a knight, a bishop, and a castle backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Harry, and Hermione took. ",
        "\"White always plays first in chess,\" said Harry, peering across the board. \"Yes ... look ...\" ",
        "A white pawn had moved forward two squares. ",
        "Harry started to direct the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione moved silently wherever Harry sent Harry, Ron and Hermione. Harry's knees were trembling. What if Harry, Ron and Hermione lost? ",
        "\"Harry -- move diagonally four squares to the right.\" ",
        "Harry, Ron and Hermione first real shock came when Harry, Ron and Hermione other knight was taken. The white queen smashed their other knight to the floor and dragged their other knight off the board, where their other knight lay quite still, facedown. ",
        "\"Had to let that happen,\" said Harry, looking shaken. \"Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.\" ",
        "Every time one of that bishop, Hermione men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Harry only just noticed in time that Harry, Ron and Hermione were in danger. Harry darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as Harry, Ron and Hermione had lost black ones. ",
        "\"We're nearly there,\" Harry muttered suddenly. \"Let me think -- let me think ...\" ",
        "The white queen turned The white queen blank face toward Harry. ",
        "\"Yes ...\" said Harry softly, \"it's the only way ... I've got to be taken.\" ",
        "\"NO!\" Harry, Ron and Hermione shouted. ",
        "\"That's chess!\" snapped Harry. \"You've got to make some sacrifices! I make my move and The white queen'll take me -- that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!\" ",
        "\"But -- \" ",
        "\"Do you want to stop Snape or not?\" ",
        "\"Harry -- \" ",
        "\"Look, if you don't hurry up, hell already have the Stone!\" ",
        "There was no alternative. ",
        "\"Ready?\" Harry called, Harry face pale but determined. \"Here I go -- now, don't hang around once you've won.\" ",
        "Harry stepped forward, and The white queen pounced. The white queen struck Harry hard across the head with The white queen stone arm, and Harry crashed to the floor -- Hermione screamed but stayed on The white queen square -- The white queen dragged Harry to one side. Harry looked as if Harry'd been knocked out. ",
        "Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left. ",
        "The white king took off The white king crown and threw his crown at Harry's feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving a heavy wooden door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron and Hermione 's cheers Harry, Ron and Hermione charged through a heavy wooden door and up the next passageway. ",
        "\"What if Harry's -- ?\" ",
        "\"Harry'll be all right,\" said Harry, trying to convince Harry. \"What do you reckon's next?\" ",
        "\"We've had Sprout's, that was the Devil's Snare; Flitwick must've put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured The chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell's spell, and Snape's ...\" ",
        "them had reached another door. ",
        "\"All right?\" Harry whispered. ",
        "\"Go on.\" ",
        "Harry pushed it open. ",
        "A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of their pull both of them robes up over both of them noses. Eyes watering, both of them saw, flat on the floor in front of both of them, a troll even larger than the one both of them had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head. ",
        "\"I'm glad we didn't have to fight that one,\" Harry whispered as both of them stepped carefully over one of that one massive legs. \"Come on, I can't breathe.\" ",
        "Harry pulled open another door, both of them both of them hardly daring to look at what came next -- but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line. ",
        "\"Snape's,\" said Harry. \"What do we have to do?\" ",
        "both of them stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind both of them in the doorway. It wasn't ordinary fire either; It was purple. At the same ",
        "instant, black flames shot up in the doorway. black flames were trapped. ",
        "\"Look!\" Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over Harry shoulder to read her shoulder: ",
        "Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind, ",
        "Two of we will help you, whichever you would find, ",
        "One among we seven will let you move ahead, ",
        "Another will transport the drinker back instead, ",
        "Two among we number hold only nettle wine, ",
        "Three of we are killers, waiting hidden in line. ",
        "Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, ",
        "To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four: ",
        "First, however slyly the poison tries to hide ",
        "You will always find some on nettle wine's left side; ",
        "Second, different are those who stand at either end, ",
        "But if you would move onward, neither is your friend; ",
        "Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, ",
        "Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in different size, ",
        "Neither dwarf nor giant insides; ",
        "Fourth, the second left and the second on the right ",
        "Are twins once you taste twins, though different at first sight ",
        "Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing Harry felt like doing. ",
        "\"Brilliant,\" said Hermione. \"This isn't magic -- it's logic -- a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, A lot of the greatest wizards'd be stuck in here forever.\" ",
        "\"But so will we, won't we?\" ",
        "\"Of course not,\" said Hermione. \"Everything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get we safely through the black fire, and one will get we back through the purple.\" ",
        "\"But how do we know which to drink?\" ",
        "\"Give me a minute.\" ",
        "Hermione read this paper several times. Then Hermione walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to Hermione and pointing at bottles. At last, Hermione clapped Hermione hands. ",
        "\"Got it,\" Hermione said. \"The smallest bottle will get we through the black fire.\" ",
        "Harry looked at the tiny bottle. ",
        "\"There's only enough there for one of us,\" \" ",
        "Harry said. \"That's hardly one swallow.\" ",
        "They looked at each other. ",
        "\"Which one will get you back through the purple flames?Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line. ",
        "\"You drink that,\" said Harry. \"No, listen, get back and get Harry. Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they'll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy -- go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need Hedwig to Dumbledore. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I'm no match for Snape, really.\" ",
        "\"But Harry -- what if You-Know- Who's with Harry?\" ",
        "\"Well -- I was lucky once, wasn't I?\" said Harry, pointing at Harry scar. \"I might get lucky again.\" ",
        "Hermione's lip trembled, and Hermione's lip suddenly dashed at Harry and threw Hermione's lip arms around Harry. ",
        "\"Hermionel\" ",
        "\"Harry -- you're a great wizard, you know.\" ",
        "\"I'm not as good as you,\" said Harry, very embarrassed, as Hermione's lip let go of Harry. ",
        "\"Me!\" said Hermione. \"Books! And cleverness! There are more important things -- friendship and bravery and -- oh Harry -- be carefull\" ",
        "\"You drink first,\" said Harry. \"You are sure which is which, aren't you?\" ",
        "\"Positive,\" said Hermione. Hermione took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered. ",
        "\"It's not poison?\" said Harry anxiously. ",
        "\"No -- but it's like ice.\" ",
        "\"Quick, go, before it wears off.\" ",
        "\"Good luck -- take care -- \" ",
        "\"GO!\" ",
        "Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire. ",
        "Harry took a deep breath and picked up the round bottle. Harry turned to face the purple flames. ",
        "\"Here I come,\" Harry said, and Harry drained the round bottle in one gulp. ",
        "It was indeed as though ice was flooding Harry body. Harry put the round bottle down and walked forward; Harry braced Harry, saw the purple flames licking his body, but couldn't feel the purple flames -- for a moment Harry could see nothing but dark fire -- then Harry was on the other side, in the last chamber. ",
        "There was already someone there -- but it wasn't Snape. It wasn't even Voldemort. "
