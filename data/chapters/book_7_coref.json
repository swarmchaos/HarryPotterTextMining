    "THE DARK LORD ASCENDING": [
        "The two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in the narrow, moonlit lane. For a second The two men stood quite still, wands directed at each other's chests; then, recognizing each other, The two men stowed The two men wands beneath The two men cloaks and started walking briskly in the same direction. ",
        "\"News?\" asked the taller of the two. ",
        "\"The best,\" replied Severus Snape. ",
        "The lane was bordered on the left by wild, low- growing brambles, on the right by a high, neatly manicured hedge. their cloaks flapped around The two men ankles as The two men marched. ",
        "\"Thought I might be late,\" said Yaxley, Yaxley blunt features sliding in and out of sight as the branches of overhanging trees broke the moonlight. \"It was a little trickier than I expected. But I hope Yaxley will be satisfied. You sound confident that your reception will be good?\" ",
        "Snape nodded, but did not elaborate. They turned right, into a wide driveway that led off The lane. The high hedge curved with They, running off into the distance beyond the pair of impressive wrought-iron gates barring the men's way. Neither of They broke step: In silence They raised They left arms in a kind of salute and passed straight through, as though the dark metal were smoke. ",
        "The yew hedges muffled the sound of the men's footsteps. There was a rustle somewhere to their right: Yaxley drew Yaxley wand again, pointing his wand over Yaxley companion's head, but the source of the noise proved to be nothing more than a pure-white peacock, strutting majestically along the top of the hedge. ",
        "\"Yaxley always did Yaxley well, Lucius. Peacocks ...\" Yaxley thrust Lucius back under Yaxley cloak with a snort. ",
        "A handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the straight drive, lights glinting in the diamond-paned downstairs windows. Somewhere in the dark garden beyond the hedge a fountain was playing. Gravel crackled beneath Gravel feet as Snape and Yaxley sped toward the front door, which swung inward at Snape and Yaxley approach, though nobody had visibly opened it. ",
        "The hallway was large, dimly lit, and sumptuously decorated, with a magnificent carpet covering most of the stone floor. The eyes of the pale-faced portraits on the walls followed Snape and Yaxley as The two men strode past. The two men halted at a heavy wooden door leading into the next room, hesitated for the space of a heartbeat, then Snape turned the bronze handle. ",
        "the next room was full of silent people, sitting at a long and ornate table. the next room's usual furniture had ",
        "been pushed carelessly up against the walls. Illumination came from a roaring fire beneath a handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a gilded mirror. Snape and Yaxley lingered for a moment on the threshold. As Snape and Yaxley eyes grew accustomed to the lack of light, Snape and Yaxley were drawn upward to the strangest feature of the scene: an apparently unconscious human figure hanging upside down over the table, revolving slowly as if suspended by an invisible rope, and reflected in a gilded mirror and in the bare, polished surface of the table below. None of the people seated underneath this singular sight was looking at this singular sight except for a pale young man sitting almost directly below this singular sight. a pale young man sitting almost directly below it seemed unable to prevent a pale young man sitting almost directly below it from glancing upward every minute or so. ",
        "\"Yaxley. Snape,\" said a high, clear voice from the head of the table. \"You are very nearly late.\" ",
        "The speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace, so that The speaker was difficult, at first, for the new arrivals to make out more than The speaker silhouette. As they drew nearer, however, The speaker face shone through the gloom, hairless, snakelike, with slits for nostrils and gleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical. The speaker was so pale that The speaker seemed to emit a pearly glow. ",
        "\"Severus, here,\" said Voldemort, indicating the seat on The speaker immediate right. \"Yaxley -- beside Dolohov.\" ",
        "The two men took The two men allotted places. Most of the eyes around the table followed Snape, and it was to Snape that Voldemort spoke first. ",
        "\"So?\" ",
        "\"My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry Potter from My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix current place of safety on Saturday next, at nightfall.\" ",
        "The interest around the table sharpened palpably: Some stiffened, others fidgeted, all gazing at Snape and Voldemort. ",
        "\"Saturday ... at nightfall,\" repeated Voldemort. Voldemort red eyes fastened upon Snape 's black ones with such intensity that some of the watchers looked away, apparently fearful that some of the watchers themselves would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze. Snape, however, looked calmly back into Voldemort's face and, after a moment or two, Voldemort's lipless mouth curved into something like a smile. ",
        "\"Good. Very good. And this information comes -- \" ",
        "\" -- from the source we discussed,\" said Snape. ",
        "\"My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix.\" ",
        "Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at Voldemort and Snape. All faces turned to Yaxley. ",
        "\"My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix, I have heard differently.\" ",
        "Yaxley waited, but Voldemort did not speak, so Yaxley went on, \"Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that Potter will not be moved until the thirtieth, the night before the boy turns seventeen.\" ",
        "Snape was smiling. ",
        "\"My source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail; this must be it. No doubt a Confundus Charm has been placed upon Dawlish. It would not be the first time; a Confundus Charm is known to be susceptible.\" ",
        "\"I assure you, my Lord, Dawlish seemed quite certain,\" said Yaxley. ",
        "\"If a Confundus Charm has been Confunded, naturally a Confundus Charm is certain,\" said Snape. \"I assure you, Yaxley, the Auror Office will play no further part in the protection of Harry Potter. The Order believes that we have infiltrated the Ministry.\" ",
        "\"The Order got one thing right, then, eh?\" said a squat man sitting a short distance from Yaxley; a squat man sitting a short distance from Yaxley gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there along the table. ",
        "Voldemort did not laugh. a squat man sitting a short distance from Yaxley gaze had wandered upward to the body revolving slowly overhead, and a squat man sitting a short distance from Yaxley seemed to be lost in thought. ",
        "\"My Lord,\" Yaxley went on, \"Dawlish believes an entire party of Aurors will be used to transfer the boy ",
        "Voldemort held up a large white hand, and Yaxley subsided at once, watching resentfully as Voldemort turned back to Snape. ",
        "\"Where are they going to hide the boy ",
        " next?\" ",
        "\"At the home of one of The Order,\" said Snape. \"The place, according to the source, has been given every protection that The Order could provide. I think that there is little chance of taking the boy ",
        " once the boy ",
        " is there, My Lord, unless, of course, the Ministry has fallen before next Saturday, which might give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments to break through the rest.\" ",
        "\"Well, Yaxley?Voldemort called down the table, the firelight glinting strangely in Voldemort red eyes. \"Will the Ministry have fallen by next Saturday?\" ",
        "Once again, all heads turned. Yaxley squared Yaxley shoulders. ",
        "\"My Lord, I have good news on that score. I have -- with difficulty, and after great effort -- suceeded in placing an Imperius Curse upon Pius Thicknesse.\" ",
        "Many of those sitting around Yaxley looked impressed; Yaxley neighbor, Dolohov, a man with a long, twisted face, clapped Yaxley on the back. ",
        "\"It is a start,\" said Voldemort. \"But Thicknesse is only one man. Scrimgeour must be surrounded by our people before I act. One failed attempt on the Minister's life will set me back a long way.\" ",
        "\"Yes -- My Lord, that is true -- but you know, as Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Thicknesse has regular contact not only with the Minister, but also with the Heads of all the other Ministry departments. It will, I think, be easy now that we have such a high-ranking official under we control, to subjugate the others, and then the others can all work together to bring Scrimgeour down.\" ",
        "\"As long as we friend Thicknesse is not discovered before our friend Thicknesse has converted the rest,\" said Voldemort. \"At any rate, it remains unlikely that the Ministry will be the Ministry before next Saturday. If we cannot touch the boy at the boy destination, then we cannot touch the boy at his destination must be done while the boy travels.\" ",
        "\"We are at an advantage there, My Lord,\" said Yaxley, who seemed determined to receive some portion of approval. \"we now have several people planted within the Department of Magical Transport. If Potter Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall know immediately.\" ",
        "\"Potter Apparates will not do either,\" said Snape. \"The Order is eschewing any form of transport that is controlled or regulated by the Ministry; The Order mistrust everything to do with the place.\" ",
        "\"All the better,\" said Voldemort. \"Voldemort will have to move in the open. Easier to take, by far.\" ",
        "Again, Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as Voldemort went on, \"I shall attend to the boy in person. There have been too many mistakes where Harry Potter is concerned. Some of The Order have been my own. That Harry Potter lives is due more to my errors than to Harry Potter triumphs.\" ",
        "The company around the table watched Voldemort apprehensively, each of them, by Voldemort or her expression, afraid that them might be blamed for Harry Potter continued existence. Voldemort, however, seemed to be speaking more to Voldemort than to any of Voldemort, still addressing the unconscious body above Voldemort. ",
        "\"I have been careless, and so have been thwarted by luck and chance, those wreckers of all but the best- laid plans. But I know better now. I understand those things that I did not understand before. I must be the one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.\" ",
        "At these words, seemingly in response to these words, a sudden wail sounded, a terrible, drawn-out cry of misery and pain. Many of those at the table looked downward, startled, for the sound had seemed to issue from below those at the table feet. ",
        "\"Wormtail,\" said Voldemort, with no change in Voldemort quiet, thoughtful tone, and without removing Voldemort eyes from the revolving body above, \"have I not spoken to you about keeping our prisoner quiet?\" ",
        "\"Yes, m-my Lord,\" gasped a small man halfway down the table, who had been sitting so low in a small man chair that it had appeared, at first glance, to be unoccupied. Now a small man scrambled from a small man seat and scurried from the next room, leaving nothing behind a small man but a curious gleam of silver. ",
        "\"As I was saying,\" continued Voldemort, looking again at the tense faces of a small man followers, \"I understand better now. I shall need, for instance, to borrow a wand from one of you before I go to kill Harry Potter.\" ",
        "The faces around a small man displayed nothing but shock; a small man might have announced that a small man wanted to borrow one of their arms. ",
        "\"No volunteers?\" said Voldemort. \"Let's see ... Lucius, I see no reason for you to have a wand anymore.\" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy looked up. \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy skin appeared yellowish and waxy in the firelight, and \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy were sunken and shadowed. When \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy spoke, \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy voice was hoarse. ",
        "\"My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix?\" ",
        "\"Your wand, Lucius. I require Your wand, Lucius.\" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy glanced sideways at \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy wife. his wife was staring straight ahead, quite as pale as \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy was, his wife long blonde hair hanging down his wife back, but beneath the table his wife slim fingers closed briefly on \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy wrist. At his wife touch, \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy put \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy hand into \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy robes, withdrew a wand, and passed a wand along to Voldemort, who held a wand up in front of \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy , examining a wand closely. ",
        "\"What is it?\" ",
        "\"Elm, my Lord,\" whispered \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy. ",
        "\"And the core?\" ",
        "\"Dragon -- dragon heartstring.\" ",
        "\"Good,\" said Voldemort. Voldemort drew out Your wand, Lucius and compared the lengths. \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy made an involuntary movement; for a fraction of a second, it seemed \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy expected to receive Voldemort's wand in exchange for \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy own. The gesture was not missed by Voldemort, whose eyes widened maliciously. ",
        "\"Give you Your wand, Lucius? My wand?\" ",
        "Some of the throng sniggered. ",
        "\"I have given you your liberty, Lucius, is that not enough for your liberty, Lucius? But I have noticed that you and your family seem less than happy of late. ... What is it about my presence in your home that displeases you, Lucius?\" ",
        "\"Nothing -- nothing, my Lord!\" ",
        "\"Such lies, Lucius ...\" ",
        "The soft voice seemed to hiss on even after the cruel mouth had stopped moving. One or two of the wizards barely repressed a shudder as the hissing grew louder; something heavy could be heard sliding across the floor beneath the table. ",
        "The huge snake emerged to climb slowly up his chair. The huge snake rose, seemingly endlessly, and came to rest across Voldemort's shoulders: The huge snake neck the thickness of a man's thigh; The huge snake eyes, with their vertical slits for pupils, unblinking. Voldemort stroked ",
        "the creature absently with long thin fingers, still looking at \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy. ",
        "\"Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with the Malfoys lot? ",
        "Is my return, my rise to power, not the very thing the Malfoys professed to desire for so many years?\" ",
        "\"Of course, My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix,\" said \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy. \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy hand shook as \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy wiped sweat from \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy upper lip. \"We did desire it -- We do.\" ",
        "To \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy's left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, his wife eyes averted from Voldemort and the snake. To his right, his son, Draco, who had been gazing up at the inert body overhead, glanced quickly at Voldemort and away again, terrified to make eye contact. ",
        "\"My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix,\" said a dark woman halfway down the table, a dark woman voice constricted with emotion, \"her voice is an honor to have you here, in We family's house. There can be no higher pleasure.\" ",
        "a dark woman sat beside a dark woman sister, as unlike a dark woman in looks, with a dark woman dark hair and heavily lidded eyes, as a dark woman was in bearing and demeanor; where Narcissa sat rigid and impassive, Bellatrix leaned toward Voldemort, for mere words could not demonstrate a dark woman longing for closeness. ",
        "\"No higher pleasure,\" repeated Voldemort, Bellatrix head tilted a little to one side as Bellatrix considered Bellatrix. \"That means a great deal, Bellatrix, from you.\" ",
        "a dark woman face flooded with color; a dark woman eyes welled with tears of delight. ",
        "\"My Lord knows I speak nothing but the truth!\" ",
        "\"No higher pleasure ... even compared with the happy event that, I hear, has taken place in your family this week?\" ",
        "a dark woman stared at him, a dark woman lips parted, evidently confused. ",
        "\"I don't know what you mean, My Lord.\" ",
        "\"I'm talking about your niece, Bellatrix. And yours, Lucius and Narcissa. a dark woman has just married the werewolf, Remus Lupin. You must be so proud.\" ",
        "There was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table. Many leaned forward to exchange gleeful looks; a few thumped the table with their fists. The great snake, disliking the disturbance, opened The great snake mouth wide and hissed angrily, but the Death Eaters did not hear The great snake, so jubilant were the Death Eaters at Bellatrix and the Malfoys' humiliation. Bellatrix's face, so recently flushed with happiness, had turned an ugly, blotchy red. ",
        "\"a dark woman is no niece of ours, my Lord,\" a dark woman cried over the outpouring of mirth. \"ours -- Narcissa and I -- have never set eyes on ours since her sister married the Mudblood. This brat has nothing to do with either of ours, nor any beast This brat marries.\" ",
        "\"What say you, Draco?\" asked Voldemort, and though his voice was quiet, his voice carried clearly through the catcalls and jeers. \"Will you babysit the cubs?\" ",
        "The hilarity mounted; \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy looked in terror at \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy father, who was staring down into \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy own lap, then caught \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy mother's eye. his mother shook his mother head almost imperceptibly, then resumed his mother own deadpan stare at the opposite wall. ",
        "\"Enough,\" said Voldemort, stroking The great snake. \"Enough.\" ",
        "And the laughter died at once. ",
        "\"Many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over time,\" he said as Bellatrix gazed at he, breathless and imploring. \"You must prune yours, must you not, to keep it healthy? Cut away those parts that threaten the health of the rest.\" ",
        "\"Yes, My Lord,\" whispered Bellatrix, and Bellatrix eyes swam with tears of gratitude again. \"At the first chance!\" ",
        "\"You shall have it,\" said Voldemort. \"And in your family, so in the world . . . we shall cut away the canker that infects we until only those of the true blood remain. ...\" ",
        "Voldemort raised \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy wand, pointed it directly at the slowly revolving figure suspended over the table, and gave it a tiny flick. the slowly revolving figure suspended over the table came to life with a groan and began to struggle against invisible bonds. ",
        "\"Do you recognize our guest, Severus?\" asked Voldemort. ",
        "Snape raised Snape eyes to the upside-down face. All of the Death Eaters were looking up at the captive now, as though All of the Death Eaters had been given permission to show curiosity. As Bellatrix revolved to face the firelight, Bellatrix said in a cracked and terrified voice, \"Severus! Help me!\" ",
        "\"Ah, yes,\" said Snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again. ",
        "\"And you, Draco?\" asked Voldemort, stroking the snake's snout with Voldemort wand-free hand. Draco shook Draco head jerkily. Now that Bellatrix had woken, Draco seemed unable to look at Bellatrix anymore. ",
        "\"But you would not have taken Bellatrix classes,\" said Voldemort. \"For those of you who do not know, we are joined here tonight by Charity Burbage who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\" ",
        "There were small noises of comprehension around the table. A broad, hunched woman with pointed teeth cackled. ",
        "\"Yes . . . Professor Burbage taught the children of witches and wizards all about Muggles . . . how they are not so different from we ...\" ",
        "One of the Death Eaters spat on the floor. Professor Burbage Professor Burbage revolved to face Snape again. ",
        "\"Severus ... please ... please ...\" ",
        "\"Silence,\" said Voldemort, with another twitch of \" ",
        "Lucius Malfoy's wand, and Charity fell silent as if gagged. ",
        "\"Not content with corrupting and polluting the minds of Wizarding children, last week Professor Burbage wrote an impassioned defense of Mudbloods in the Daily Prophet Wizards, Professor Burbage says, must accept these thieves of their knowledge and magic. The dwindling of the purebloods is, says Professor Burbage, a most desirable circumstance. ... Professor Burbage would have us all mate with Muggles ... or, no doubt, werewolves. ...\" ",
        "Nobody laughed this time: There was no mistaking the anger and contempt in Voldemort's voice. For the third time, Professor Burbage revolved to face Snape. Tears were pouring from Professor Burbage into Professor Burbage hair. Snapelooked back at Professor Burbage, quite impassive, as Professor Burbage turned slowly away from Snape again. ",
        "\"Avada Kedavra.\" ",
        "The flash of green light illuminated every corner of the room. Charity fell, with a resounding crash, onto the table below, which trembled and creaked. Several of the Death Eaters leapt back in the Death Eaters chairs. Draco fell out of Draco onto the floor. ",
        "\"Dinner, Nagini,\" said Voldemort softly, and The great snake swayed and slithered from Voldemort shoulders onto the polished wood. "

    "IN MEMORIAM": [
        "Harry was bleeding. Clutching Voldemort right hand in Voldemort left and swearing under Voldemort breath, Voldemort shouldered open Voldemort bedroom door. There was a crunch of breaking china: Voldemort had trodden on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom door. ",
        "\"What the -- ?\" ",
        "Voldemort looked around; the landing of number four, Privet Drive, was deserted. Possibly the cup of tea was Dudley's idea of a clever booby trap. Keeping his right hand elevated, Harry scraped the fragments of cup together with his right hand and threw together with the other hand into the already crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door. Then Harry tramped across to the bathroom to run Harry finger under the tap. ",
        "It was stupid, pointless, irritating beyond belief that Harry still had four days left of being unable to perform magic . . . but Harry had to admit to Harry that this jagged cut in his finger would have defeated Harry. Harry ",
        "had never learned how to repair wounds, and now Harry came to think of it -- particularly in light of Harry immediate plans -- this seemed a serious flaw in Harry magical education. Making a mental note to ask Hermione how it was done, Harry used a large wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as Harry could, before returning to Harry bedroom and slamming the door behind Harry. ",
        "Harry had spent the morning completely emptying Harry school trunk for the first time since Harry had packed his school trunk six years ago. At the start of the intervening school years, Harry had merely skimmed off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated the topmost three quarters of the contents, leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom -- old quills, desiccated beetle eyes, single socks that no longer fit. Minutes previously, Harry had plunged his right hand into this mulch, experienced a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of Harry right hand, and withdrawn his right hand to see a lot of blood. ",
        "Harry now proceeded a little more cautiously. Kneeling down beside his school trunk again, Harry groped around in the bottom and, after retrieving an old badge that flickered feebly between Support CEDRIC DIGGORY and POTTER STINKS , a cracked and worn-out Sneakoscope, and a gold locket inside which a note signed R.A.B. had been hidden, Harry finally discovered the sharp edge that had done the damage. Harry recognized it at once. it was a two-inch-long fragment of the enchanted mirror that Harry dead godfather, Sirius, had given Harry. Harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around his school trunk, but nothing more remained of Harry godfather's last gift except powdered glass, which clung to the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit. ",
        "Harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which Harry had cut Harry, seeing nothing but Harry own bright ",
        "green eye reflected back at Harry. Then Harry placed the fragment on top of that morning's Daily Prophet, which lay unread on the bed, and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories, the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned, by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk. ",
        "It took another hour to empty It completely, throw away the useless items, and sort the remainder in piles according to whether or not Harry would need the useless items from now on. Harry school and Quidditch robes, cauldron, parchment, quills, and most of Harry textbooks were piled in a corner, to be left behind. Harry wondered what Harry aunt and uncle would do with his aunt and uncle; burn his aunt and uncle in the dead of night, probably, as if his aunt and uncle were the evidence of some dreadful crime. Harry Muggle clothing, Invisibility Cloak, potion-making kit, certain books, the photograph album Hagrid had once given Harry, a stack of letters, and Harry wand had been repacked into an old rucksack. In a front pocket were the Marauder's Map and the locket with the note signed R.A.B. inside R.A.B.. The locket was accorded this place of honor not because The locket was valuable -- in all usual senses The locket was worthless -- but because of what The locket had cost to attain The locket. ",
        "This left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his snowy owl, Hedwig: one for each of the days Harry had spent at Privet Drive this summer. ",
        "his got up off the floor, stretched, and moved across to his desk. Hedwig made no movement as his began to flick through the newspapers, throwing no movement onto the rubbish pile one by one. his snowy owl was asleep, or else faking; Hedwig was angry with Harry about the limited amount of time Hedwig was allowed out of Hedwig cage at the moment. ",
        "As his neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers, Harry slowed down, searching for one particular issue that Harry knew had arrived shortly after Harry had returned to Privet Drive for the summer; Harry remembered that there had been a small mention on the front about the resignation of Professor Burbage, the Muggle Studies teacher at Hogwarts. At last Harry found it. Turning to page ten, Harry sank into Harry desk chair and reread the article Harry had been looking for. ",
        "ALBUS DUMBLEDORE REMEMBERED ",
        "by Elphias Doge ",
        "I met Albus Dumbledore at the age of eleven, on our first day at Hogwarts. our mutual attraction was undoubtedly due to the fact that we both felt our to be outsiders. I had contracted dragon pox shortly before arriving at school, and while I was no longer contagious, my pockmarked visage and greenish hue did not encourage many to approach me. For his part, Albus had arrived at Hogwarts under the burden of unwanted notoriety. Scarcely a year previously, Albus father, Percival, had been convicted of a savage and well-publicized attack upon three young Muggles. ",
        "Albus never attempted to deny that Albus father (who was to die in Azkaban) had committed this crime; on the contrary, when I plucked up courage to ask his father (who was to die in Azkaban), his father (who was to die in Azkaban) assured me that his father (who was to die in Azkaban) knew his father (who was to die in Azkaban) to be guilty. Beyond that, Albus Dumbledore refused to speak of the sad business, though many attempted to make Albus Dumbledore do so. Some, indeed, were disposed to praise his father (who was to die in Azkaban)'s action and assumed that Albus too was a Muggle- hater. Some could not have been more mistaken: As anybody who knew Albus would attest, Albus never revealed the remotest anti-Muggle tendency. Indeed, ",
        "Albus determined support for Muggle rights gained Albus many enemies in subsequent years. ",
        "In a matter of months, however, Albus's own fame had begun to eclipse that of his father (who was to die in Azkaban). By the end of Albus first year Albus would never again be known as the son of a Muggle-hater, but as nothing more or less than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school. Those of us who were privileged to be Albus friends benefited from Albus example, not to mention Albus help and encouragement, with which Albus was always generous. Albus confessed to me in later life that Albus knew even then that Albus greatest pleasure lay in teaching. ",
        "Albus not only won every prize of note that the school offered, Albus was soon in regular correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day, including Nicolas Flamel, the celebrated alchemist ; Bathilda Bagshot, the noted historian; and Adalbert Waffling, the magical theoretician. Several of Albus papers found their way into learned publications such as Transfiguration Today, Challenges in Charming, and The Practical Potioneer. Albus Dumbledore's future career seemed likely to be meteoric, and the only question that remained was when Albus Dumbledore would become Minister of Magic. Though it was often predicted in later years that Albus Dumbledore was on the point of taking the job, however, Albus Dumbledore never had Ministerial ambitions. ",
        "Three years after we had started at Hogwarts, Albus's brother, Aberforth, arrived at school. They were not alike; Aberforth was never bookish and, unlike Albus, preferred to settle arguments by dueling rather than through reasoned discussion. However, it is quite wrong to suggest, as some have, that the brothers were not friends. the brothers rubbed along as comfortably as two such different boys could do. In fairness to Aberforth, it must be admitted that living in Albus's  ",
        "shadow cannot have been an altogether comfortable experience. Being continually outshone was an occupational hazard of being his friend and cannot have been any more pleasurable as a brother. ",
        "When Albus and I left Hogwarts we intended to take the then- traditional tour of the world together, visiting and observing foreign wizards, before pursuing we separate careers. However, tragedy intervened. On the very eve of we trip, Albus's mother, Kendra, died, leaving Albus the head, and sole breadwinner, of the family. I postponed my departure long enough to pay my respects at Kendra's funeral, then left for what was now to be a solitary journey. With a younger brother and sister to care for, and little gold left to a younger brother and sister, there could no longer be any question of Albus accompanying me. ",
        "That was the period of we lives when we had least contact. I wrote to Albus, describing, perhaps insensitively, the wonders of my journey, from narrow escapes from chimaeras in Greece to the experiments of the Egyptian alchemists. Albus letters told me little of Albus day-to-day life, which I guessed to be frustratingly dull for such a brilliant wizard. Immersed in my own experiences, it was with horror that I heard, toward the end of my year's travels, that yet another tragedy had struck the Dumbledores: the death of Albus sister, Ariana. ",
        "Though Ariana had been in poor health for a long time, the blow, coming so soon after the loss of their mother, had a profound effect on both of Ariana brothers. All those closest to Albus -- and I count myself one of that lucky number -- agree that Ariana 's death, and Albus's feeling of personal responsibility for it (though, of course, he was guiltless), left Ariana 's death, and Albus's feeling of personal responsibility for it (though, of course, he was guiltless) mark upon he forevermore. ",
        "I returned home to find a young man who had experienced a much older person's suffering. Albus was more reserved than before, and much less light- hearted. To add to Albus misery, the loss of Ariana had led, not to a renewed closeness between Albus and Aberforth, but to an estrangement. (In time this would lift -- in later years they reestablished, if not a close relationship, then certainly a cordial one.) However, Albus rarely spoke of Albus parents or of Ariana from then on, and Albus friends learned not to mention his parents or of Ariana. ",
        "Other quills will describe the triumphs of the following years. Albus Dumbledore's innumerable contributions to the store of Wizarding knowledge, including Albus Dumbledore discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, will benefit generations to come, as will the wisdom Albus Dumbledore displayed in the many judgments Albus Dumbledore made while Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. They say, still, that no Wizarding duel ever matched that between Albus Dumbledore and Grindelwald in 1 945. Those who witnessed it have written of the terror and the awe They felt as They watched these two extraordinary wizards do battle. Albus Dumbledore's triumph, and its consequences for the Wizarding world, are considered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy or the downfall of He- Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. ",
        "Albus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; Albus Dumbledore could find something to value in anyone, however apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe that Albus Dumbledore early losses endowed Albus Dumbledore with great humanity and sympathy. I shall miss Albus Dumbledore friendship more than I can say, but my loss is as nothing compared to the Wizarding world's. That Albus Dumbledore was the most inspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters cannot be in question.

        "Harry finished reading but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying the obituary. Albus Dumbledore was wearing Albus Dumbledore familiar, kindly smile, but as Albus Dumbledore peered over the top of Albus Dumbledore half-moon spectacles, Albus Dumbledore gave the impression, even in newsprint, of X-raying Harry, whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation. ",
        "Albus Dumbledore had thought Albus Dumbledore knew Albus Dumbledore quite well, but ever since reading the obituary Albus Dumbledore had been forced to recognize that Albus Dumbledore had barely known Albus Dumbledore at all. Never once had Albus Dumbledore imagined Albus Dumbledore 's childhood or youth; it was as though Albus Dumbledore had sprung into being as Harry had known Albus Dumbledore, venerable and silver-haired and old. The idea of a teenage Albus Dumbledore was simply odd, like trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt. ",
        "Albus Dumbledore had never thought to ask Albus Dumbledore about Albus Dumbledore past. No doubt it would have felt strange, impertinent even, but after all, it had been common knowledge that Albus Dumbledore had taken part in that legendary duel with Grindelwald, and Harry had not thought to ask Albus Dumbledore what that had been like, nor about any of Albus Dumbledore other famous achievements. No, they had always discussed Harry, Harry's past, Harry's future, Harry's plans ... and it seemed to Harry now, despite the fact that Harry future was so dangerous and so uncertain, that Harry had missed irreplaceable opportunities when Harry had failed to ask Albus Dumbledore more about Harry, even though the only personal question Harry had ever asked Harry headmaster was also the only one Harry suspected that Albus Dumbledore had not answered honestly: ",
        "\" What do you see when you look in the mirror?\" ",
        "\" ? I see Harry holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\" ",
        "After several minutes' thought, Harry tore the obituary out of the Prophet, folded the obituary carefully, and tucked the obituary inside the first volume of Practical Defensive Magic and the obituary Use Against the Dark Arts. Then Harry threw the rest of the newspaper onto the rubbish pile and turned to face the room. It was much tidier. The only things left out of place were today's Daily Prophet, still lying on the bed, and on top of it, the piece of broken mirror. ",
        "Harry moved across the room, slid the mirror fragment off the Prophet, and unfolded the newspaper. Harry had merely glanced at the headline when Harry had taken the rolled-up paper from the delivery owl early that morning and thrown the rolled-up paper aside, after noting that the rolled-up paper said nothing about Voldemort. Harry was sure that the Ministry was leaning on the Prophet the Prophet to suppress news about Voldemort. It was only now, therefore, that Harry saw what Harry had missed. ",

        "DUMBLEDORE -- THE TRUTH AT LAST? ",
        "Coming next week, the shocking story of the flawed genius considered by many to be the greatest wizard of Albus Dumbledore generation. Stripping away the popular image of serene, silver-bearded wisdom, Rita Skeeter reveals the disturbed childhood, the lawless youth, the lifelong feuds, and the guilty secrets that Albus Dumbledore carried to Albus Dumbledore grave. WHY was the man tipped to be Minister of Magic content to remain a mere headmaster? WHAT was the real purpose of the secret organization known as the Order of the Phoenix? ",
        "HOW did Albus Dumbledore really meet Albus Dumbledore end? ",
        "The answers to these and many more questions are explored in the explosive new biography, The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, by Rita Skeeter, exclusively interviewed by Betty Braithwaite, page 13, inside. ",
        "Harry ripped open the paper and found page thirteen. The article was topped with a picture showing another familiar face: a woman wearing jeweled glasses with elaborately curled blonde hair, Rita Skeeter teeth bared in what was clearly supposed to be a winning smile, wiggling Rita Skeeter fingers up at Harry. Doing Harry best to ignore this nauseating image, Harry read on. ",
        "In person, Rita Skeeter is much warmer and softer than Rita Skeeter famously ferocious quill-portraits might suggest. Greeting me in the hallway of Rita Skeeter cozy home, Rita Skeeter leads me straight into the kitchen for a cup of tea, a slice of pound cake and, a slice of pound cake goes without saying, a steaming vat of freshest gossip. ",
        "\"Well, of course, Albus Dumbledore is a biographer's dream,\" says Rita Skeeter. \"Such a long, full life. I'm sure my book will be the first of very, very many.\" ",
        "Rita Skeeter was certainly quick off the mark. Rita Skeeter nine- hundred-page book was completed a mere four weeks after Albus Dumbledore 's mysterious death in June. I ask Rita Skeeter how Rita Skeeter managed this superfast feat. ",
        "\"Oh, when you've been a journalist as long as I have, working to a deadline is second nature. I knew that the Wizarding world was clamoring for the full story and I wanted to be the first to meet that need.\" ",
        "I mention the recent, widely publicized remarks of Elphias Doge, Special Advisor to the Wizengamot and longstanding friend of Albus Dumbledore's, that \"Rita Skeeter's book contains less fact than a Chocolate Frog card. \" ",
        "Rita Skeeter throws back Rita Skeeter head and laughs. ",
        "\"Darling Dodgy! I remember interviewing Albus Dumbledore's a few years back about merpeople rights, bless Albus Dumbledore's. Completely gaga, seemed to think we were sitting at the bottom of Lake Windermere, kept telling me to watch out for trout.\" ",
        "And yet Elphias Doge accusations of inaccuracy have been echoed in many places. Does Rita Skeeter really feel that four short weeks have been enough to gain a full picture of Albus Dumbledore's long and extraordinary life? ",
        "\"Oh, my dear,\" beams Rita Skeeter, rapping me affectionately across the knuckles, \"you know as well as I do how much information can be generated by a fat bag of Galleons, a refusal to hear the word 'no,' and a nice sharp Quick-Quotes Quill! People were queuing to dish the dirt on Albus Dumbledore anyway. Not everyone thought Albus Dumbledore was so wonderful, you know -- Albus Dumbledore trod on an awful lot of important toes. But Elphias Doge can get off Elphias Doge high hippogriff, because I've had access to a source most journalists would swap most journalists wands for, one who has never spoken in public before and who was close to Albus Dumbledore during the most turbulent and disturbing phase of Albus Dumbledore youth.\" ",
        "The advance publicity for Rita Skeeter s biography has certainly suggested that there will be shocks in store for those who believe Albus Dumbledore to have led a blameless life. What were the biggest surprises Rita Skeeter uncovered, I ask? ",
        "\"Now, come off it, Betty, I'm not giving away all the highlights before anybody's bought Her nine- hundred-page book!\" laughs Rita Skeeter. \"But I can promise that anybody who still thinks Albus Dumbledore was white as Albus Dumbledore beard is in for a ",
        "rude awakening! Let's just say that nobody hearing Albus Dumbledore rage against You-Know-Who would have dreamed that Albus Dumbledore dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in his youth! And for a wizard who spent Albus Dumbledore later years pleading for tolerance, Albus Dumbledore wasn't exactly broad-minded when Albus Dumbledore was younger! Yes, Albus Dumbledore had an extremely murky past, not to mention that very fishy family, which Albus Dumbledore worked so hard to keep hushed up.\" ",
        "I ask whether Rita Skeeter is referring to Albus Dumbledore 's brother, Aberforth, whose conviction by the Wizengamot for misuse of magic caused a minor scandal fifteen years ago. ",
        "\"Oh, Aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap, \" laughs Rita Skeeter. \"No, no, I'm talking about much worse than a brother with a fondness for fiddling about with goats, worse even than the Muggle-maiming father -- Albus Dumbledore couldn't keep either of both quiet anyway, both were both charged by the Wizengamot. No, it's the mother and the sister that intrigued me, and a little digging uncovered a positive nest of nastiness -- but, as I say, you'll have to wait for chapters nine to twelve for full details. All I can say now is, it's no wonder Albus Dumbledore never talked about how Albus Dumbledore nose got broken. \" ",
        "Family skeletons notwithstanding, does Rita Skeeter deny the brilliance that led to Albus Dumbledore 's many magical discoveries? ",
        "\"Rita Skeeter had brains,\" Rita Skeeter concedes, \"although many now question whether Rita Skeeter could really take full credit for all of Rita Skeeter supposed achievements. As I reveal in chapter sixteen, Ivor Dillonsby claims Ivor Dillonsby had already discovered eight uses of dragon's blood when Albus Dumbledore 'borrowed' Ivor Dillonsby papers.\" ",
        "But the importance of some of Albus Dumbledore's achievements cannot, I venture, be denied. What of Albus Dumbledore famous defeat of Grindelwald? ",
        "\"Oh, now, I'm glad you mentioned Grindelwald,\" says Rita Skeeter with a tantalizing smile. \"I'm afraid those who go dewy-eyed over Albus Dumbledore's spectacular victory must brace those who go dewy-eyed over Dumbledore's spectacular victory for a bombshell -- or perhaps a Dungbomb. Very dirty business indeed. All I'll say is, don't be so sure that there really was the spectacular duel of legend. After they've read my book, people may be forced to conclude that Grindelwald simply conjured a white handkerchief from the end of Grindelwald wand and came quietly!\" ",
        "Skeeter refuses to give any more away on this intriguing subject, so we turn instead to the relationship that will undoubtedly fascinate \" ",
        "Skeeter readers more than any other. ",
        "\"Oh yes,\" says Rita Skeeter, nodding briskly, \"I devote an entire chapter to the whole Potter-Dumbledore relationship. It's been called unhealthy, even sinister. Again, your readers will have to buy my book for the whole story, but there is no question that Albus Dumbledore took an unnatural interest in Potter from the word go. Whether that was really in the boy's best interests -- well, we'll see. It's certainly an open secret that Potter has had a most troubled adolescence.\" ",
        "I ask whether Rita Skeeter is still in touch with Harry Potter, whom Rita Skeeter so famously interviewed last year: a breakthrough piece in which Potter spoke exclusively of Potter conviction that You-Know-Who had returned. ",
        "\"Oh, yes, we've developed a close bond,\" says Rita Skeeter. \"Potter has few real friends, and we met at one of the most testing moments of Potter life -- the Triwizard Tournament. I am probably one of the only people ",
        "alive who can say that they know PotterPotter.\" ",
        "Which leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about Albus Dumbledore's final hours. Does Rita Skeeter believe that Potter was there when Albus Dumbledore died? ",
        "\"Well, I don't want to say too much -- it's all in Her nine- hundred-page book -- but eyewitnesses inside Hogwarts castle saw Potter running away from the scene moments after Albus Dumbledore fell, jumped, or was pushed. Potter later gave evidence against Severus Snape, a man against whom he has a notorious grudge. Is everything as it seems? That is for the Wizarding community to decide -- once they've read Her nine- hundred-page book.\" ",
        "On that intriguing note, I take my leave. There can be no doubt that Rita Skeeter has quilled an instant bestseller. Albus Dumbledore's legions of admirers, meanwhile, may well be trembling at what is soon to emerge about Dumbledore's legions of admirers hero. ",
        "Harry reached the bottom of the article, but continued to stare blankly at the page. Revulsion and fury rose in Harry like vomit; Harry balled up the newspaper and threw the newspaper, with all Harry force, at the wall, where the newspaper joined the rest of the rubbish heaped around Harry overflowing bin. ",
        "Harry began to stride blindly around the room, opening empty drawers and picking up books only to replace empty drawers on the same piles, barely conscious of what Harry was doing, as random phrases from Rita's article echoed in Harry head: An entire chapter to the whole Potter-Dumbledore relationship . . . An entire chapter to the whole Potter-Dumbledore relationship's been called unhealthy, even sinister. . . . Harry dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in his youth . . . I've had access to a source most journalists would swap most journalists wands for ... ",
        "\"Lies!\" Harry bellowed, and through the window Harry saw the next-door neighbor, who had paused to restart Harry lawn mower, look up nervously. ",
        "Harry sat down hard on the bed. The broken bit of mirror danced away from Harry; Harry picked The broken bit of mirror up and turned The broken bit of mirror over in Harry fingers, thinking, thinking of Albus Dumbledore and the lies with which Rita Skeeter was defaming Harry. ... ",
        "A flash of brightest blue. Harry froze, Harry cut finger slipping on the jagged edge of the mirror again. Harry had imagined it, Harry must have done. Harry glanced over Harry shoulder, but the wall was a sickly peach color of Aunt Petunia's choosing: There was nothing blue there for the mirror to reflect. Harry peered into the mirror fragment again, and saw nothing but Harry own bright green eye looking back at Harry. ",
        "Harry had imagined it, there was no other explanation; imagined it, because Harry had been thinking of Harry dead headmaster. If anything was certain, it was that the bright blue eyes of Albus Dumbledore would never pierce Albus Dumbledore again. ",

Harry was still gazing at the mirror fragment in which, for a split second, Harry had thought Harry saw Albus Dumbledore's eye.

        "\"What a surprise,\" said Harry. ",

I don't suppose those things matter to a bunch of layabout wizards -- \" ",

        "\"They'll be here in about five minutes,\" Harry said, and when none of the Dursleys replied, Harry left the room. The prospect of parting -- probably forever -- from Harry aunt, uncle, and cousin was one that Harry was able to contemplate quite cheerfully, but there was nevertheless a certain awkwardness in the air. What did you say to one another at the end of sixteen years' solid dislike? ",

        "\"You, Harry,\" Dedalus continued, \"will wait here for your guard. There has been a little change in the arrangements -- \" ",
        "\"What d'you mean?\" said Harry at once. \"I thought Mad-Eye was going to come and take me by Side- Along- Apparition?\" ",
        "\"Can't do it,\" said Hestia tersely. \"Mad-Eye will explain.\" ",
        "The Dursleys, who had listened to all of this with looks of utter incomprehension on their faces, jumped as a loud voice screeched, \"Hurry up\\\" Harry looked all around the room before realizing that the voice had issued from Dedalus's pocket watch. ",
        "\"Quite right, we're operating to a very tight schedule,\" said Dedalus, nodding at Dedalus watch and tucking his watch back into his waistcoat. \"we are attempting to time your departure from the house with your family's Disapparition, Harry; thus, the charm breaks at the  ",
        "moment you all head for safety.\" Dedalus turned to the Dursleys. \"Well, are we all packed and ready to go?\" ",
        "None of we all answered Dedalus. Uncle Vernon was still staring, appalled, at the bulge in Dedalus's waistcoat pocket. ",
        "\"Perhaps None of them should wait outside in the hall, ",
        "Dedalus,\" murmured Hestia. Uncle Vernon clearly felt that it would be tactless for them to remain in the room while Harry and the Dursleys exchanged loving, possibly tearful farewells. ",
        "\"There's no need,\" ",
        "Harry muttered, but Uncle Vernon made any further explanation unnecessary by saying loudly, ",
        "\"Well, this is good-bye, then, boy.\" ",
        "Uncle Vernon swung Uncle Vernon right arm upward to shake Harry's hand, but at the last moment seemed unable to face his right arm upward, and merely closed Uncle Vernon fist and began swinging his right arm upward backward and forward like a metronome. ",
        "\"Ready, Diddy?\" asked Aunt Petunia, fussily checking the clasp of Aunt Petunia handbag so as to avoid looking at Harry altogether. ",
        "Dudley did not answer, but stood there with his mouth slightly ajar, reminding Harry a little of the giant, Grawp. ",
        "\"Come along, then,\" said Uncle Vernon. ",
        "Uncle Vernon had already reached the living room door when Dudley mumbled, \"I don't understand.\" ",
        "\"What don't you understand, popkin?\" asked Aunt Petunia, looking up at Aunt Petunia son. ",
        "Dudley raised a large, hamlike hand to point at Harry. ",
        "\"Why isn't Dudley coming with us?\" ",
        "Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia froze where Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia stood, staring at Dudley as though Dudley had just expressed a desire to become a ballerina. ",
        "\"What?\" said Uncle Vernon loudly. ",
        "\"Why isn't Dudley coming too?\" asked Dudley. ",
        "\"Well, Dudley -- Dudley doesn't want to,\" said Uncle Vernon, turning to glare at Harry and adding, \"You don't want to, do you?\" ",
        "\"Not in the slightest,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"There you are,\" Uncle Vernon told Dudley. \"Now come on, us're off.\" ",
        "Dudley marched out of the room. They heard the front door open, but Dudley did not move and after a few faltering steps Aunt Petunia stopped too. ",
        "\"What now?\" barked Uncle Vernon, reappearing in the doorway. ",
        "It seemed that Dudley was struggling with concepts too difficult to put into words. After several moments of apparently painful internal struggle Dudley said, \"But where's Dudley going to go?\" ",
        "Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked at each other. It was clear that Dudley was frightening Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon. Hestia Jones broke the silence. ",
        "\"But . . . surely you know where your nephew is going?\" your nephew asked, looking bewildered. ",
        "\"Certainly we know,\" said Vernon Dursley. \"your nephew's off with some of your lot, isn't your nephew? Right, Dudley, let's get in the car, you heard your nephew, we're in a hurry.\" ",
        "Again, Vernon Dursley marched as far as the front door, but Dudley did not follow. ",
        "\"Off with some of we lot?\" ",
        "Hestia looked outraged. Harry had met this attitude before: Witches and wizards seemed stunned that Harry closest living relatives took so little interest in the famous Harry Potter. ",
        "\"It's fine,\" Harry assured Harry. \"It doesn't matter, honestly.\" ",
        "\"Doesn't matter?\" repeated Hestia, Harry voice rising ominously. \"Don't these people realize what you've been through? What danger you are in? The unique position you hold in the hearts of the anti-Voldemort movement?\" ",
        "\"Er -- no, these people don't,\" said Harry. \"these people think I'm a waste of space, actually, but I'm used to -- \" ",
        "\"I don't think you're a waste of space.\" ",
        "If Harry had not seen Dudley's lips move, Harry might not have believed Harry had not seen Dudley's lips move. As it was, Harry stared at Dudley for several seconds before accepting that it must have been Harry cousin who had spoken; for one thing, ",
        "Dudley had turned red. Harry was embarrassed and astonished Harry. ",
        "\"Well ... er ... thanks, Dudley.\" ",
        "Again, Dudley appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy for expression before mumbling, \"You saved my life.\" ",
        "\"Not really,\" said Harry. \"It was your soul the dementor would have taken. ...\" ",
        "Harry looked curiously at Harry cousin. They had had virtually no contact during this summer or last, as Harry had come back to Privet Drive so briefly and kept to Harry room so much. It now dawned on Harry, however, that the cup of cold tea on which Harry had trodden that morning might not have been a booby trap at all. Although rather touched, Harry was nevertheless quite relieved that Dudley appeared to have exhausted Harry ability to express Harry feelings. After opening his mouth once or twice more, Dudley subsided into scarlet-faced silence. ",
        "Aunt Petunia burst into tears. Hestia Jones gave Aunt Petunia an approving look that changed to outrage as Aunt Petunia ran forward and embraced Dudley rather than Harry. ",
        "\"S-so sweet, Dudders ...\" Aunt Petunia sobbed into Harry massive chest. \"S-such a lovely b-boy ... s-saying thank you ",
        "\"But Dudley hasn't said thank you at all!\" said Hestia indignantly. \"Dudley only said Dudley didn't think Harry was a waste of space!\" ",
        "\"Yeah, but coming from Dudley that's like 'I love you,' \" said Harry, torn between annoyance and a desire to laugh as Aunt Petunia continued to clutch at Dudley as if Aunt Petunia had just saved Harry from a burning building. ",
        "\"Are we going or not?\" roared Uncle Vernon, reappearing yet again at the living room door. \"I thought we were on a tight schedule!\" ",
        "\"Yes -- yes, we are,\" said Dedalus Diggle, who had been watching these exchanges with an air of bemusement and now seemed to pull himself together. \"we really must be off. Harry -- \" ",
        "Harry tripped forward and wrung Harry's hand with both of Harry own. ",
        "\" -- good luck. I hope we meet again. The hopes of the Wizarding world rest upon your shoulders.\" ",
        "\"Oh,\" said Harry, \"right. Thanks.\" ",
        "\"Farewell, Harry,\" said Hestia, also clasping his hand. \"we thoughts go with you.\" ",
        "\"I hope everything's okay,\" said Harry with a glance toward Aunt Petunia and Dudley. ",
        "\"Oh, I'm sure we shall end up the best of chums,\" said Diggle brightly, waving Diggle hat as Diggle left the room. Hestia followed Diggle. ",
        "Dudley gently released Dudley from his mother's clutches and walked toward Harry, who had to repress an urge to threaten Dudley with magic. Then Dudley held out Dudley large, pink hand. ",
        "\"Blimey, Dudley,\" said Harry over Aunt Petunia renewed sobs, \"did the dementors blow a different personality into you?\" ",
        "\"Dunno,\" muttered Dudley. \"See you, Harry.\" ",
        "\"Yeah ...\" said Harry, taking Dudley's hand and shaking Dudley's hand. \"Maybe. Take care, Dudley Dudley nearly smiled, then lumbered from the room. Harry heard Harry heavy footfalls on the graveled drive, and then a car door slammed. ",
        "Aunt Petunia, whose face had been buried in Harry handkerchief, looked around at the sound. Harry did not seem to have expected to find Harry alone with Harry. Hastily stowing her handkerchief into Harry pocket, Harry said, \"Well -- good-bye,\" and marched toward a car door without looking at Harry. ",
        "\"Good-bye,\" said Harry. ",
        "Harry stopped and looked back. For a moment Harry had the strangest feeling that Harry wanted to say something to Harry: Harry gave Harry an odd, tremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge of speech, but then, with a little jerk of Harry head, Harry bustled out of the room after Harry husband and son.

    "THE SEVEN POTTERS": [
        "Harry ran back upstairs to THE SEVEN POTTERS ",
        "Harry bedroom, arriving at the window just in time to see the Dursleys car swinging out of the drive and off up the road. Dedalus's top hat was visible between Aunt Petunia and Dudley in the backseat. the Dursleys' car turned right at the end of Privet Drive, the Dursleys' car windows burned scarlet for a moment in the now setting sun, and then the Dursleys' car was gone. ",
        "Harry picked up Hedwig's cage, Harry Firebolt, and Harry rucksack, gave his bedroom one last sweeping look, and then made Harry ungainly way back downstairs to the hall, where Harry deposited cage, broomstick, and bag near the foot of the stairs. The light was fading rapidly now, the hall full of shadows in the evening light. The light felt most strange to stand here in the silence and know that Harry was about to leave the house for the last time. Long ago, when Harry had been left alone while the Dursleys went out to enjoy themselves, the hours of solitude had been a rare treat: Pausing only to sneak something tasty from the fridge, Harry had rushed upstairs to play on Dudley's ",
        "computer, or put on the television and flicked through the channels to Harry heart's content. It gave Harry an odd, empty feeling to remember those times; it was like remembering a younger brother whom Harry had lost. ",
        "\"Don't you want to take a last look at the place?\" Harry asked Hedwig, who was still sulking with her head under her wing. \"We'll never be here again. Don't you want to remember all the good times? I mean, look at this doormat. What memories ... Dudley puked on it after I saved Dudley from the dementors. ... Turns out Dudley was grateful after all, can you believe it? ... And last summer, Dumbledore walked through that front door. ",
        "Harry lost the thread of Harry thoughts for a moment and Hedwig did nothing to help Harry retrieve the thread of his thoughts, but continued to sit with her head under her wing. Harry turned Harry back on that front door. ",
        "\"And under here, Hedwig\" -- Harry pulled open a door under the stairs -- \"is where I used to sleep! You never knew me then -- Blimey, it's small, I'd forgotten. ...\" ",
        "Harry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas, remembering how Harry used to wake every morning looking up at the underside of the staircase, which was more often than not adorned with a spider or two. Those had been the days before Harry had known anything about Harry true identity; before Harry had found out how Harry parents had died or why such strange things often happened around Harry. But Harry could still remember the dreams that had dogged Harry, even in those days: confused dreams involving flashes of green light and once -- Uncle Vernon had nearly crashed the car when Harry had recounted it -- a flying motorbike . . . ",
        "There was a sudden, deafening roar from somewhere nearby. Harry straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of Harry head on the low door frame. Pausing only to employ a few of Uncle Vernon choicest swear words, Harry staggered back into the kitchen, clutching his head and staring out of the window into the back garden. ",
        "The darkness seemed to be rippling, the air itself quivering. Then, one by one, figures began to pop into sight as figures Disillusionment Charms lifted. Dominating the scene was Hagrid, wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting astride an enormous motorbike with a black sidecar attached. All around him other people were dismounting from brooms and, in two cases, skeletal, black winged horses. ",
        "Wrenching open that front door, Harry hurtled into their midst. There was a general cry of greeting as Hermione flung Harry arms around Harry, Ron clapped Harry on the back, and Hagrid said, \"All righ', Harry? Ready fer the off?\" ",
        "\"Definitely,\" said Harry, beaming around at them all. \"But I wasn't expecting this many of you!\" ",
        "\"Change of plan,\" growled Mad-Eye, who was holding two enormous, bulging sacks, and whose magical eye was spinning from darkening sky to house to garden with dizzying rapidity. \"Let's get undercover before we talk you through it.\" ",
        "Harry led them all back into the kitchen where, laughing and chattering, them settled on chairs, sat them upon Aunt Petunia's gleaming work surfaces, or leaned up against Aunt Petunia's spotless appliances: Ron, long and lanky; Hermione, Aunt Petunia's bushy hair tied back in a long plait; Fred and George, grinning identically; Bill, badly scarred and long-  ",
        "haired; Mr. Weasley, kind-faced, balding, Ron spectacles a little awry; Mad-Eye, battle-worn, one- legged, one- bright blue magical eye whizzing in one- socket; Tonks, whose short hair was her favorite shade of bright pink; Lupin, grayer, more lined; Fleur, slender and beautiful, with her long silvery blonde hair; Kingsley, bald, black, broad-shouldered; Hagrid, with one- wild hair and beard, standing hunchbacked to avoid hitting one- head on the ceiling; and Mundungus Fletcher, small, dirty, and hangdog, with one- droopy basset hound's eyes and matted hair. Harry's heart seemed to expand and glow at the sight: Harry felt incredibly fond of all of them, even Mundungus, whom Harry had tried to strangle the last time them had met. ",
        "\"Kingsley, I thought you were looking after the Muggle Prime Minister?\" the Muggle Prime Minister called across the room. ",
        "\"the Muggle Prime Minister can get along without the Muggle Prime Minister for one night,\" said Kingsley. \"You're more important.\" ",
        "HarryHarry, guess what?\" said Tonks from Tonks perch on top of the washing machine, and Tonks wiggled Tonks left hand at Tonks from her perch on top of the washing machine; a ring glittered there. ",
        "\"You got married?\" Harry yelped, looking from Tonks to Lupin. ",
        "\"I'm sorry you couldn't be there, Harry, it was very quiet.\" ",
        "\"That's brilliant, congrat -- \" ",
        "\"All right, all right, we'll have time for a cozy catch-up later!\" roared Moody over the hubbub, and silence fell in the kitchen. Moody over dropped Moody over sacks at Moody over feet and turned to Harry. \"As Dedalus probably told you, we had to abandon Plan A. Pius Thicknesse has gone  ",
        "over, which gives we a big problem. Plan A. Pius Thicknesse's made Plan A. Pius Thicknesse an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the Floo Network, place a Portkey here, or Apparate in or out. All done in the name of your protection, to prevent You-Know-Who getting in at Harry. Absolutely pointless, seeing as your mother's charm does that already. What Plan A. Pius Thicknesse's really done is to stop you getting out of here safely. ",
        "\"Second problem: You're underage, which means you've still got the Trace on Harry.\" ",
        "\"I don't -- \" ",
        "\"the Trace, the Trace!\" said Mad-Eye impatiently. ",
        "\"The charm that detects magical activity around under-seventeens, the way the Ministry finds out about underage magic! If you, or anyone around you, casts a spell to get you out of here, Plan A. Pius Thicknesse is going to know about a spell, and so will the Death Eaters. ",
        "\"We can't wait for the Trace to break, because the moment you turn seventeen you'll lose all the protection your mother gave you. In short: Plan A. Pius Thicknesse thinks Plan A. Pius Thicknesse's got you cornered good and proper.\" ",
        "Harry could not help but agree with Plan A. Pius Thicknesse. ",
        "\"So what are we going to do?\" ",
        "\"We're going to use the only means of transport left to We, the only ones the Trace can't detect, because We don't need to cast spells to use them: brooms, thestrals, and Hagrid's motorbike.\" ",
        "Harry could see flaws in this plan; however, Harry held Harry tongue to give Mad-Eye the chance to address them. ",
        "\"Now, your mother's charm will only break under two conditions: when you come of age, or\" -- Moody over gestured around the pristine kitchen -- \"you no longer call this place home. You and your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight, in the full understanding that you're never going to live together again, correct?Harry Harry nodded. ",
        "\"So this time, when you leave, there'll be no going back, and your mother's charm will break the moment you get outside your mother's charm range. We're choosing to break your mother's charm early, because the alternative is waiting for You-Know-Who to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen. ",
        "\"The one thing we've got on we side is that You- Know-Who doesn't know we're moving you tonight. we've leaked a fake trail to the Ministry: the Ministry think you're not leaving until the thirtieth. However, this is You-Know-Who we're dealing with, so we can't just rely on him getting the date wrong; him's bound to have a couple of Death Eaters patrolling the skies in this general area, just in case. So, we've given a dozen different houses every protection we can throw at a dozen different houses. They all look like a dozen different houses could be the place we're going to hide you, a dozen different houses've all got some connection with the Order: my house, Kingsley's place, Molly's Auntie Muriel's -- you get the idea.\" ",
        "\"Yeah,\" said Harry, not entirely truthfully, because Harry could still spot a gaping hole in this plan. ",
        "\"You'll be going to Tonks's parents. Once you're within the boundaries of the protective enchantments we've put on Tonks's parents house, you'll be able to use a Portkey to the Burrow. Any questions?\" ",
        "\"Er -- yes,\" said Harry. \"Maybe the Burrow won't know which of the twelve secure houses I'm heading for at first, but won't it be sort of obvious once\" -- Harry performed a quick headcount -- \"fourteen of us fly off toward Tonks's parents'?\" ",
        "\"Ah,\" said Moody over, \"I forgot to mention the key point. Fourteen of us won't be flying to Tonks's parents'. There will be seven Harry Potters moving through the skies tonight, each of Harry Potters with a companion, each pair heading for a different safe house.\" ",
        "From inside Harry cloak Moody over now withdrew a flask of what looked like mud. There was no need for Harry to say another word; Harry understood the rest of this plan immediately. ",
        "\"No!\" Harry said loudly, Harry voice ringing through the kitchen. \"No way!\" ",
        "\"I told them you'd take it like this,\" said Hermione with a hint of complacency. ",
        "\"If you think I'm going to let six people risk six people lives ",

        "\" -- because it's the first time for all of us,\" said Ron. ",
        "\"This is different, pretending to be me -- \" ",
        "\"Well, none of us really fancy it, Harry,\" said Fred earnestly. \"Imagine if something went wrong and us were stuck as specky, scrawny gits forever.\" ",
        "Harry did not smile. ",
        "\"You can't do it if I don't cooperate, you need me to give you some hair.\" ",
        "\"Well, that's this plan scuppered,\" said George. \"Obviously there's no chance at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate.\" ",
        "\"Yeah, thirteen of us against one bloke who's not allowed to use magic; us've got no chance,\" said Fred earnestly. ",
        "\"Funny,\" said Harry, \"really amusing.\" ",
        "\"If it has to come to force, then it will,\" growled Moody, Moody, magical eye now quivering a little in it socket as Moody, glared at Harry. \"Everyone here's overage, Potter, and they're all prepared to take the risk.\" ",
        "Mundungus shrugged and grimaced; the magical eye swerved sideways to glare at Mundungus out of the side of Moody over head. ",
        "\"Let's have no more arguments. Time's wearing on. I want a few of your hairs, boy, now.\" ",
        "\"But this is mad, there's no need -- \" ",
        "\"No need!\" snarled Moody over. \"With You-Know-Who out there and half the Ministry on the side of Moody's head? Potter, if we're lucky hell have swallowed the fake bait and Potter'll be planning to ambush you on the thirtieth, but Potter'd be mad not to have a Death Eater or two keeping an eye out, it's what I'd do. They might not be able to get at Potter or this house while your mother's charm holds, but it's about to break and They know the rough position of the place. Our only chance is to use ",
        "decoys. Even You-Know-Who can't split himself into seven.\" ",
        "Harry caught Hermione's eye and looked away at once. ",
        "\"So, Potter -- some of your hair, if you please.\" ",
        "Harry glanced at Ron, who grimaced at Harry in a just- do-it sort of way. ",
        "\"Now!\" barked Moody over. ",
        "With all of their eyes upon Harry, Harry reached up to the top of Harry head, grabbed a hank of hair, and pulled. ",
        "\"Good,\" said Moody over, limping forward as Harry pulled the stopper out of the flask of potion. \"Straight in here, if you please.\" ",
        "Harry dropped a hank of hair into the mudlike liquid. The moment it made contact with it surface, the potion began to froth and smoke, then, all at once, the potion turned a clear, bright gold. ",
        "\"Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,\" said Hermione, before catching sight of Ron's raised eyebrows, blushing slightly, and saying, \"Oh, you know what I mean -- Goyle 's potion looked like bogies.\" ",
        "\"Right then, fake Potters line up over here, please,\" said Moody over. ",
        "Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Fleur lined up in front of Aunt Petunia's gleaming sink. ",
        "\"We're one short,\" said Lupin. ",
        "\"Here,\" said Hagrid gruffly, and Hagrid gruffly lifted Mundungus by the scruff of the neck and dropped Hagrid gruffly down beside Fleur, who wrinkled her nose pointedly and moved along to stand between Fred earnestly and George instead. ",
        "\"I've toldjer, I'd sooner be a protector,\" said Mundungus. ",
        "\"Shut it,\" growled Moody over. \"As I've already told you, you spineless worm, any Death Eaters we run into will be aiming to capture Potter, not kill Death Eaters. Dumbledore always said You-Know-Who would want to finish Potter in person. It'll be the protectors who have got the most to worry about, the Death Eaters'll want to kill the protectors who have got the most to worry.\" ",
        "Mundungus did not look particularly reassured, but Moody over was already pulling half a dozen eggcup-sized glasses from inside Mundungus cloak, which Mundungus handed out, before pouring a little Polyjuice Potion into each one. ",
        "\"Altogether, then ...\" ",
        "Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Fleur, and Mundungus drank. All of Fleur, and Mundungus gasped and grimaced as a little Polyjuice Potion hit All of them throats: At once, All of them features began to bubble and distort like hot wax. Hermione and Mundungus were shooting upward; Ron, Fred, and George were shrinking; Ron, Fred, and George hair was darkening, Hermione's and Fleur's appearing to shoot backward into Ron, Fred, and George skulls.

        "Moody, quite unconcerned, was now loosening the ties of the large sacks he had brought with he. When he straightened up again, there were six Harry Potters gasping and panting in front of he. ",
        "Fred earnestly and George turned to each other and said together, \"Wow -- we're identical!\" ",
        "\"I dunno, though, I think I'm still better-looking,\" said Fred earnestly, examining Fred earnestly reflection in the kettle. ",

        "\"Those whose clothes are a bit roomy, I've got smaller here,\" said Moody over, indicating the first sack, \"and vice versa. Don't forget the glasses, there's six pairs in the side pocket. And when you're dressed, there's luggage in the first sack.\" ",
        "Harry Harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre thing Harry had ever seen, and Harry had seen some extremely odd things. Harry watched as Harry six doppelgangers rummaged in the large sacks he had brought with him, pulling out sets of clothes, putting on glasses, stuffing their own things away. Harry felt like asking their to show a little more respect for Harry privacy as they all began stripping off with impunity, clearly much more at ease with displaying Harry body than their would have been with their own.

        "\"I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo,\" said Ron, looking down at Ron bare chest. ",

        "\"I'm George,\" said the twin at whom Moody over was pointing. \"Can't you even tell us apart when us're Harry?\" ",
        "\"Sorry, George -- \" ",
        "\"I'm only yanking your wand, I'm Fred earnestly really -- \" ",
        "\"Enough messing around!\" snarled Moody over. \"The other one -- George or Fred earnestly or whoever you are -- you're with Remus. Miss Delacour -- \" ",
        "\"I'm taking Fleur on a thestral,\" said Bill. \"Fleur's not that fond of brooms.\" ",

        "\"That's great,\" said Harry, not altogether truthfully. ",
        "\"We think the Death Eaters will expect you to be on a broom,\" said Moody, who seemed to guess how Harry was feeling. \"Snape's had plenty of time to tell the Death Eaters everything about you Snape's never mentioned before, so if We do run into any Death Eaters, We're betting we do run into any Death Eaters'll choose one of Harry Potters who look at home on a broomstick. All right then,\" Snape went on, tying up the sack with the fake Potters' clothes in it and leading the way back to the door, \"I make it three minutes until we're supposed to leave. No point locking the door, the door won't keep the Death Eaters out when the Death Eaters come looking. ... Come on. ...\" ",
        "Harry hurried into the hall to fetch Harry rucksack, Firebolt, and Hedwig's cage before joining the others in the dark back garden. On every side broomsticks were leaping into hands; Hermione had already been helped up onto a great black thestral by Kingsley, Fleur onto the other by Bill. Hagrid was standing ready beside the motorbike, goggles on. ",
        "\"Is this it? Is this Sirius's bike?\" ",
        "\"The very same,\" said Hagrid, beaming down at Harry. \"An' the last time yeh was on it, Harry, I could fit yeh in one hand!\" ",
        "Harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as Harry got into the sidecar. the sidecar placed Harry several feet below ",
        "everybody else: Ron smirked at the sight of Ron sitting there like a child in a bumper car. Harry stuffed his rucksack, Firebolt, and Hedwig's cage and broomstick down by Harry feet and rammed Hedwig's cage between Harry knees. It was extremely uncomfortable. ",
        "\"Arthur's done a bit o' tinkerin',\" said Hagrid, quite oblivious to Harry's discomfort. Harry settled Harry astride the motorcycle, which creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground. \"It's got a few tricks up It handlebars now. Tha' one was my idea.\" ",
        "Harry pointed a thick finger at a purple button near the speedometer. ",
        "\"Please be careful, Hagrid,\" said Mr. Weasley, who was standing beside them, holding a broomstick. \"I'm still not sure that was advisable and it's certainly only to be used in emergencies.\" ",
        "\"All right then,\" said Moody over. \"Everyone ready, please; ",
        "I want Everyone to leave at exactly the same time or the whole point of the diversion's lost.\" ",
        "Everybody mounted their brooms. ",
        "\"Hold tight now, Ron,\" said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw a furtive, guilty look at Lupin before placing Ron hands on either side of her waist. Hagrid kicked the motorbike into life: Hagrid roared like a dragon, and the sidecar began to vibrate. ",
        "\"Good luck, everyone,\" shouted Moody over. \"See you all in about an hour at the Burrow. On the count of three. One ... two ... THREE.\" ",
        "There was a great roar from the motorbike, and Harry felt the sidecar give a nasty lurch: Harry was rising through the air fast, Harry eyes watering slightly, hair ",
        "whipped back off his face. Around Harry brooms were soaring upward too; the long black tail of a thestral flicked past. Harry legs, jammed into the sidecar by Hedwig's cage and Harry rucksack, were already sore and starting to go numb. So great was Harry discomfort that Harry almost forgot to take a last glimpse of number four, Privet Drive; by the time Harry looked over the edge of the sidecar Harry could no longer tell which one it was. Higher and higher they climbed into the sky -- ",
        "And then, out of nowhere, out of nothing, they were surrounded. At least thirty hooded figures, suspended in midair, formed a vast circle in the midst of which the Order members had risen, oblivious -- ",
        "Screams, a blaze of green light on every side: Hagrid gave a yell and the motorbike rolled over. Harry lost any sense of where they were: Streetlights above Harry, yells around Harry, Harry was clinging to the sidecar. Hedwig's cage, the Firebolt, and his rucksack, Firebolt, and Hedwig's cage slipped from beneath Harry knees -- ",
        "\"No -- HEDWIG!\" ",
        "a broomstick spun to earth, but a broomstick just managed to seize the strap of his rucksack, Firebolt, and Hedwig's cage and the top of the cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again. A second's relief, and then another burst of green light. The owl screeched and fell to the floor of the cage. ",
        "\"No -- NO!\" ",
        "the motorbike zoomed forward; Harry glimpsed hooded Death Eaters scattering as Hagrid blasted through their circle. ",
        "\"Hedwig -- Hedwig -- \" ",
        "But The owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of the cage. The owl could not take The owl in, and The owl terror for the others was paramount. The owl glanced over The owl shoulder and saw a mass of people moving, flares of green light, two pairs of people on brooms soaring off into the distance, but The owl could not tell who they were -- ",
        "\"Hagrid, we've got to go back, we've got to go back!\" The owl yelled over the thunderous roar of the engine, pulling out The owl wand, ramming Hedwig's cage onto the floor of the cage, refusing to believe that Hedwig was dead. \"Hagrid, TURN AROUND!\" ",
        "\"My job's ter get you there safe, Harry!\" bellowed Hagrid, and Harry opened the throttle. ",
        "\"Stop -- STOP!\" Harry shouted, but as Harry looked back again two jets of green light flew past Harry left ear: Four Death Eaters had broken away from the circle and were pursuing Four Death Eaters, aiming for Hagrid 's broad back. Hagrid swerved, but the Death Eaters were keeping up with the bike; more curses shot after the Death Eaters, and Harry had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid the Death Eaters. Wriggling around Harry cried, \"Stupefy\\\" and a red bolt of light shot from Harry own wand, cleaving a gap between the four pursuing Death Eaters as the four pursuing Death Eaters scattered to avoid it. ",
        "\"Hold on, Harry, this'll do for 'em!\" roared Hagrid, and Harry looked up just in time to see Hagrid slamming a thick finger into a green button near the fuel gauge. ",
        "A wall, a solid brick wall, erupted out of the exhaust pipe. Craning Harry neck, Harry saw his neck expand into being in midair. Three of the Death Eaters swerved and avoided his neck, but the fourth was not so lucky: Harry vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder from behind his neck, a broomstick broken into pieces.  ",
        "One of Harry fellows slowed up to save Harry, but his fellows and the airborne wall were swallowed by darkness as Hagrid leaned low over the handlebars and sped up. ",
        "More Killing Curses flew past Harry's head from the two remaining Death Eaters' wands; the two remaining Death Eaters' wands were aiming for Hagrid. Harry responded with further Stunning Spells: Red and green collided in midair in a shower of multicolored sparks, and Harry thought wildly of fireworks, and the Muggles below who would have no idea what was happening -- ",
        "\"Here we go again, Harry, hold on!\" yelled Hagrid, and Harry jabbed at a second button. This time a great net burst from the bike's exhaust, but the Death Eaters were ready for it. Not only did the Death Eaters swerve to avoid it, but the companion who had slowed to save the Death Eaters unconscious friend had caught up. Harry bloomed suddenly out of darkness and now three of the Death Eaters were pursuing the motorbike, all shooting curses after the motorbike. ",
        "\"This'll do it, Harry, hold on tight!\" yelled Hagrid, and Harry saw Harry slam Harry whole hand onto the purple button beside the speedometer. ",
        "With an unmistakable bellowing roar, dragon fire burst from the exhaust, white-hot and blue, and the motorbike shot forward like a bullet with a sound of wrenching metal. Harry saw the Death Eaters swerve out of sight to avoid the deadly trail of flame, and at the same time felt the sidecar sway ominously: the Death Eaters metal connections to the bike had splintered with the force of acceleration. ",
        "\"It's all righ', Harry!\" bellowed Hagrid, now thrown flat onto Hagrid back by the surge of speed; nobody was steering now, and the sidecar was starting to twist violently in the bike's slipstream. ",
        "'Tm on it, Harry, don' worry!\" Hagrid yelled, and from inside Hagrid jacket pocket Hagrid pulled Hagrid flowery pink umbrella. ",
        "\"Hagrid! No! Let me!\" ",
        "\"REPAROl\" ",
        "There was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the bike completely: Harry sped forward, propelled by the impetus of the bike's flight, then the sidecar began to lose height -- ",
        "In desperation Harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted, \"Wingardium Leviosal\" ",
        "the sidecar rose like a cork, unsteerable but at least still airborne: the sidecar had but a split second's relief, however, as more curses streaked past the sidecar: the Death Eaters were closing in. ",
        "\"I'm cornin', Harry!\" Hagrid yelled from out of darkness, but Harry could feel the sidecar beginning to sink again: Crouching as low as Harry could, Harry pointed at the middle of the oncoming figures and yelled, \"Impedimental\" ",
        "The jinx hit the middle Death Eater in the chest: For a moment the sidecar was absurdly spread-eagled in midair as though the sidecar had hit an invisible barrier: One of his fellows almost collided with the sidecar -- ",
        "Then the sidecar began to fall in earnest, and the remaining Death Eater shot a curse so close to Harry that Harry had to duck below the rim of the car, knocking out a tooth on the edge of Harry seat -- ",
        "\"I'm cornin', Harry, I'm cornin'!\" ",
        "A huge hand seized the back of Harry's robes and hoisted Harry out of the sidecar; Harry pulled his rucksack, Firebolt, and Hedwig's cage with Harry as Harry dragged Harry onto the motorbike's seat and found Harry back-to- back with Hagrid. As they soared upward, away from the two remaining Death Eaters, Harry spat blood out of Harry mouth, pointed his wand at the sidecar, and yelled, \"Confringo\\\" ",
        "Harry knew a dreadful, gut-wrenching pang for Hedwig as it exploded; the remaining Death Eater the remaining Death Eater was blasted off the remaining Death Eater broom and fell from sight; the remaining Death Eater companion fell back and vanished. ",

        "\"It's not a problem, just keep flying!\" Harry shouted back, as two more Death Eaters emerged out of darkness, drawing closer. ",
        "As the curses came shooting across the intervening space again, Hagrid swerved and zigzagged: Harry knew that Hagrid did not dare use the dragon-fire button again, with Harry seated so insecurely. Harry sent Stunning Spell after Stunning Spell back at their pursuers, barely holding their off. Harry shot another blocking jinx at their: the remaining Death Eater swerved to avoid the remaining Death Eater and the remaining Death Eater hood slipped, and by the red light of the remaining Death Eater next Stunning Spell, Harry saw the strangely blank face of Stanley Shunpike -- Stan -- ",

        "But Harry was afraid: The hooded Death Eater had shouted \"It's the real one!\"; how had The hooded Death Eater known? The hooded Death Eater gazed around at darkness and felt darkness menace. Where were they? ",
        "The hooded Death Eater clambered around on the motorbike's seat to face forward and seized hold of the back of Hagrid 's jacket. ",
        "\"Hagrid, do the dragon-fire thing again, let\"Hagrid get out of here!\" ",
        "\"Hold on tight, then, Harry!\" ",
        "There was a deafening, screeching roar again and the white-blue fire shot from the exhaust: Harry felt Harry slipping backward off what little of the motorbike's seat, Hagrid flung backward upon Harry, barely maintaining Harry grip on the handlebars -- ",
        "\"I think we've lost 'em Harry, I think we've done it!\" yelled Hagrid. ",
        "But Harry was not convinced: Fear lapped at Harry as Harry looked left and right for pursuers Harry was sure would come. ... Why had they fallen back? One of they had still had a wand. ... It's Harry ... it's the real one. . . . they had said it right after Harry had tried to Disarm Stan. ... ",
        "\"we're nearly there, Harry, we've nearly made it!\" shouted Hagrid. ",
        "Harry felt the bike drop a little, though the lights down on the ground still seemed remote as stars. ",
        "Then the scar on Harry forehead burned like fire; as a Death Eater appeared on either side of the bike, two Killing Curses missed Harry by millimeters, cast from behind -- ",
        "And then Harry saw Harry. Voldemort was flying like smoke on the wind, without broomstick or thestral to hold Voldemort, Voldemort snakelike face gleaming out of the blackness, Voldemort white fingers raising Voldemort again -- ",
        "Hagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a vertical dive. Clinging on for dear life, Harry sent Stunning Spells flying at random into the whirling night. Harry saw a body fly past Harry and knew Harry had hit one of them, but then Harry heard a bang and saw sparks from the engine; the motorbike spiraled through the air, completely out of control -- ",
        "Green jets of light shot past them again. Harry had no idea which way was up, which down: Harry scar was still burning; Harry expected to die at any second.

        "\"NO!\" ",
        "With a shout of Hagrid launched Harry off the bike at a Death Eater; to Harry horror, Harry saw both Hagrid and a Death Eater falling out of sight, both Hagrid and the Death Eater combined weight too much for a broomstick -- ",
        "Barely gripping the bike with Harry knees, Harry heard Voldemort scream, \"Mine\\\" ",
        "It was over: Harry could not see or hear where Voldemort was; Harry glimpsed another Death Eater swooping out of the way and heard, \"Avada -- \" ",
        "As the pain from Harry's scar forced Harry eyes shut, his wand acted of his wand own accord. Harry felt it drag Harry hand around like some great magnet, saw a spurt of golden fire through Harry half-closed eyelids, heard a crack and a scream of fury. the remaining Death Eater Death Eater yelled; Voldemort screamed, \" No\\ Somehow, Harry found Harry nose an inch from the dragon-fire button. Harry punched an inch from the dragon-fire button with his hand and the bike shot more flames into the air, hurtling straight toward the ground. ",

        "Harry felt Voldemort before Harry saw Voldemort. Looking sideways, Harry stared into the red eyes and was sure the red eyes would be the last thing Harry ever saw: Voldemort preparing to curse Harry once more -- ",
        "And then Voldemort vanished. Harry looked down and saw Hagrid spread-eagled on the ground below Harry. Harry pulled hard at the handlebars to avoid hitting Harry, groped for the brake, but with an earsplitting, ground-trembling crash, Harry smashed into a muddy pond. ",

The idea was dreadful to Harry, Harry could not believe The idea of any of them. \"Voldemort only caught up with me toward the end, Voldemort didn't know which one I was in the beginning. If Voldemort'd been in on the plan Voldemort'd have known from the start I was the one with Hagrid.\" ",
        "\"Voldemort caught up with you?\" said Lupin sharply. \"What happened? How did you escape?\" ",
        "Harry explained briefly how The Death Eaters pursuing The Death Eaters had seemed to recognize The Death Eaters as the true Harry, how The Death Eaters had abandoned the chase, how The Death Eaters must have summoned Voldemort, who had appeared just before The Death Eaters and Hagrid had reached the sanctuary of Tonks's parents. ",
        "\"The Death Eaters recognized you? But how? What had you done?\" ",
        "\"I ...\" Harry tried to remember; the whole journey seemed like a blur of panic and confusion. \"I saw Stan Shunpike. ... You know, the bloke who was the conductor on the Knight Bus? And I tried to Disarm him instead of -- well, Stan Shunpike doesn't know what Stan Shunpike's doing, does Stan Shunpike? Stan Shunpike must be Imperiused!\" ",
        "Lupin looked aghast. ",
        "\"Harry, the time for Disarming is past! The Death Eaters are trying to capture and kill you! At least Stun if you aren't prepared to kill!\" ",
        "\"We were hundreds of feet up! Stan Shunpike's not Stan Shunpike, and if I Stunned Stan Shunpike and Stan Shunpike'd fallen, Stan Shunpike'd have died the same as if I'd used Avada Kedavra! Expelliarmus saved me from Voldemort two years ago,\" Harry added defiantly. Lupin was reminding Stan Shunpike of the sneering Hufflepuff Zacharias Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach Dumbledore's Army how to Disarm. ",
        "\"Yes, Harry,\" said Lupin with painful restraint, \"and a great number of Death Eaters witnessed that happening! Forgive me, but it was a very unusual move then, under imminent threat of death. ",
        "Repeating it tonight in front of Death Eaters who either witnessed or heard about the first occasion was close to suicidal!\" ",
        "\"So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike?\" said Harry angrily. ",
        "\"Of course not,\" said Lupin, \"but The Death Eaters -- frankly, most people! -- would have expected you to attack back! Expelliarmus is a useful spell, Harry, but The Death Eaters seem to think Expelliarmus is your signature move, and I urge you not to let Expelliarmus become so!\" ",
        "Lupin was making Harry feel idiotic, and yet there was still a grain of defiance inside Harry. ",
        "\"I won't blast people out of my way just because people're there,\" said Harry. \"That's Voldemort's job.\" ",
        "Lupin's retort was lost: Finally succeeding in squeezing through the door, Hagrid staggered to a chair and sat down; a chair collapsed beneath a chair. ",
        "Ignoring a chair mingled oaths and apologies, Harry addressed Lupin again. ",

        "There was a scuffling from outside. Lupin dived for the back door; Harry leapt over Hagrid's legs and sprinted into the yard. ",
        "Two figures had appeared in the yard, and as Harry ran toward Two figures Harry realized Two figures were Hermione, now returning to Hermione normal appearance, and Kingsley, Two figures clutching a bent coat hanger. Hermione flung Hermione into Harry's arms, but Kingsley showed no pleasure at the sight of any of Two figures. Over Hermione 's shoulder Harry saw Kingsley raise Kingsley wand and point his wand at Lupin's chest. ",

        "\"So it seems,\" replied Lupin, \"but apparently They did not realize that there would be seven Harrys.\" ",
        "\"Small comfort!\" snarled Kingsley. \"Who else is back?\" ",

        "Harry Harry behaved a little too kindly to Stan Shunpike,\" said Lupin. ",
        "\"Stan Shunpike?\" repeated Hermione. \"But I thought Kingsley was in Azkaban?\" ",
        "Kingsley let out a mirthless laugh. ",
        "Hermione, there's obviously been a mass breakout which the Ministry has hushed up. Travers's hood fell off when I cursed Travers, Travers's supposed to be inside too. But what happened to you, Remus? Where's George?\" ",
        "\"Travers lost an ear,\" said Lupin. ",
        "\"Lost an -- ?\" repeated Hermione in a high voice. ",
        "\"Snape's work,\" said Lupin. ",

        "Silence fell between the four of them as them looked up at the sky. There was no sign of movement; the stars stared back, unblinking, indifferent, unobscured by flying friends. Where was Ron? Where were Fred and Mr. Weasley? Where were Bill, Fleur, Tonks, Mad-Eye, and Mundungus? ",
        "HarryHarry, give us a hand!\" called Hagrid hoarsely from the door, in which Harry was stuck again. Glad of something to do, Harry pulled Harry free, then headed through the empty kitchen and back into the sitting room, where Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were still tending to George. Mrs. Weasley had staunched Mrs. Weasley bleeding now, and by the lamplight Harry saw a clean, gaping hole where George's ear had been. ",
        "\"How is Harry?\" ",
        "Mrs. Weasley looked around and said, \"I can't make it grow back, not when it's been removed by Dark Magic. But it could have been so much worse. ... Harry's alive.\" ",

        "Mrs. Weasley dropped to \" ",
        "Mrs. Weasley knees beside George. For the first time since Harry had known George, Fred seemed to be lost for words. Fred gaped over the back of the sofa at Fred twin's wound as if Fred could not believe what Fred was seeing. ",
        "Perhaps roused by the sound of Fred and their father's arrival, George stirred. ",
        "\"How do you feel, Georgie?\" whispered Mrs. Weasley. George's fingers groped for the side of George head. \"Saintlike,\" George murmured. ",
        "\"What's wrong with George?\" croaked Fred, looking terrified. \"Is George mind affected?\" ",
        "\"Saintlike,\" repeated George, opening George eyes and looking up at George brother. \"You see ... I'm holy. Hole v, Fred, geddit?\" ",
        "Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever. Color flooded Fred's pale face. ",
        "\"Pathetic,\" George told George. \"Pathetic! With the whole wide world of ear-related humor before you, you go for holey?\" ",
        "\"Ah well,\" said George, grinning at George tear-soaked mother. \"You'll be able to tell us apart now, anyway, Mum.\" ",
        "George looked around. ",
        "\"Hi, Harry -- you are Harry, right?\" ",
        "\"Yeah, I am,\" said Harry, moving closer to the sofa. ",
        "\"Well, at least us got you back okay,\" said George. \"Why aren't Ron and Bill huddled round my sickbed?\" ",
        "\"Ron and Bill're not back yet, George,\" said Mrs. Weasley. George's grin faded. ",
        "Harry glanced at Ginny and motioned to Ginny to accompany George back outside. As Ron and Bill walked through the kitchen Ginny said in a low voice, \"Ron and Tonks should be back by now. \"Ron and Tonks didn't have a long journey; Auntie Muriel's not that far from here.\" ",
        "Harry said nothing. Harry had been trying to keep fear at bay ever since reaching the Burrow, but now it enveloped Harry, seeming to crawl over Harry skin, throbbing in Harry chest, clogging Harry throat. As they walked down the back steps into the dark yard, Ginny took Harry hand. ",
        "Kingsley was striding backward and forward, glancing up at the sky every time Kingsley turned. Harry was reminded of Uncle Vernon pacing the living room a million years ago. Hagrid, Hermione, and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, gazing upward in silence. None ",
        "of Hagrid, Hermione, and Lupin looked around when Harry and Ginny joined Harry and Ginny silent vigil. ",
        "The minutes stretched into what might as well have been years. The slightest breath of wind made them all jump and turn toward the whispering bush or tree in the hope that one of the missing Order members might leap unscathed from Order leaves -- ",
        "And then a broom materialized directly above the missing Order members and streaked toward the ground -- ",
        "\"It's the missing Order members!\" screamed Hermione. ",
        "Tonks landed in a long skid that sent earth and pebbles everywhere. ",
        "\"Remus!\" Tonks cried as Tonks staggered off a broom into Lupin's arms. Tonks face was set and white: Tonks seemed unable to speak. Ron tripped dazedly toward Harry and Hermione. ",
        "\"You're okay,\" Ron mumbled, before Hermione flew at Ron and hugged Ron tightly. ",
        "\"I thought -- I thought -- \" ",
        "\" 'M all right,\" said Ron, patting her on the back. \" 'M fine.\" ",
        "\"Ron was great,\" said Tonks warmly, relinquishing Tonks hold on Lupin. \"Wonderful. Stunned one of the Death Eaters, straight to the head, and when you're aiming at a moving target from a flying broom -- \" ",
        "\"You did?\" said Hermione, gazing up at Ron with her arms still around Ron neck. ",
        "\"Always the tone of surprise,\" Ron said a little grumpily, breaking free. \"Are we the last back?\" ",
        "\"No,\" said Ginny, \"we're still waiting for Bill and Fleur and Mad-Eye and Mundungus. I'm going to tell Mum and Dad you're okay, Ron -- \" ",
        "Ginny ran back inside. ",
        "\"So what kept you? What happened?\" Lupin sounded almost angry at Tonks. ",
        "\"Bellatrix,\" said Tonks. \"Ginny wants me quite as much as Ginny wants Harry, Remus, Ginny tried very hard to kill me. I just wish I'd got Ginny, I owe Bellatrix. But we definitely injured Rodolphus. ... Then we got to Ron's Auntie Muriel's and we'd missed we Portkey and Ginny was fussing over we -- \" ",
        "A muscle was jumping in Lupin's jaw. Ron nodded, but seemed unable to say anything else. ",
        "\"So what happened to you lot?\" Tonks asked, turning to Harry, Hermione, and Kingsley. ",
        "Harry, Hermione, and Kingsley recounted the stories of Harry, Hermione, and Kingsley own journeys, but all the time the continued absence of Bill, Fleur, Mad- Eye, and Mundungus seemed to lie upon Harry, Hermione, and Kingsley like a frost, a frost icy bite harder and harder to ignore. ",
        "\"I'm going to have to get back to Downing Street, I should have been there an hour ago,\" said Kingsley finally, after a last sweeping gaze at the sky. \"Let me know when they're back.\" ",
        "Lupin nodded. With a wave to the others, Kingsley walked away into the darkness toward the gate. Harry thought Harry heard the faintest pop as Kingsley Disapparated just beyond the Burrow's boundaries. ",
        "Mr. and Mrs. Weasley came racing down the back steps, GinnyMr. and Mrs. Weasley. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley hugged Ron before turning to Lupin and Tonks. ",

        "\"What's wrong with George?\" piped up Ron. ",
        "\"George's lost -- \" ",
        "But the end of Mrs. Weasley 's sentence was drowned in a general outcry: A thestral had just soared into sight and landed a few feet from A thestral. A thestral slid from Bill back, windswept but unhurt. ",
        "\"Bill! Thank God, thank God -- \" ",
        "Mrs. Weasley ran forward, but the hug Bill bestowed upon \" ",
        "Mrs. Weasley was perfunctory. Looking directly at God, \" ",
        "Mrs. Weasley said, \"Mad-Eye's dead.\" ",
        "Nobody spoke, nobody moved. Harry felt as though something inside Harry was falling, falling through the earth, leaving Harry forever. ",
        "\"We saw it,\" said Bill; Fleur nodded, tear tracks glittering on Fleur cheeks in the light from the kitchen window. \"It happened just after We broke out of the circle: Mad-Eye and Dung were close by We, Mad-Eye and Dung were heading north too. Voldemort -- he can fly -- went straight for Mad-Eye and Dung. Dung panicked, I heard Dung cry out, Mad-Eye tried to stop Dung, but Mad-Eye Disapparated. Voldemort's curse hit Mad-Eye full in the face, Voldemort fell backward off Voldemort broom and -- there was nothing We ",

        "... Mad-Eye, so tough, so brave, the consummate survivor ... ",
        "At last it seemed to dawn on everyone, though nobody said it, that there was no point waiting in the yard anymore, and in silence they followed Mr. and Mrs. Weasley back into the Burrow, and into the living room, where Fred and George were laughing together. ",
        "\"What's wrong?\" said Fred, scanning their faces as their entered. \"What's happened? Who's -- ?\" ",
        "\"Mad-Eye,\" said \" ",
        "Mrs. Weasley. \"Dead.\" ",
        "The twins' grins turned to grimaces of shock. Nobody seemed to know what to do. Tonks was crying silently into a handkerchief: Tonks had been close to Mad-Eye, Harry knew, Harry favorite and Harry protegee at the Ministry of Magic. Hagrid, who had sat down on the floor in the corner where Harry had most space, was dabbing at his eyes with Harry tablecloth-sized handkerchief. ",
        "Bill walked over to the sideboard and pulled out a bottle of fire-whisky and some glasses. ",
        "\"Here,\" Bill said, and with a wave of Bill wand Bill sent twelve full glasses soaring through the room to each of them, holding the thirteenth aloft. \"Mad-Eye.\" ",
        "\"Mad-Eye,\" they all said, and drank. ",
        "\"Mad-Eye,\" echoed Hagrid, a little late, with a hiccup. ",
        "The firewhisky seared Harry's throat. It seemed to burn feeling back into Harry's throat, dispelling the numbness and sense of unreality, firing Harry's throat with something that was like courage. ",
        "\"So Mundungus disappeared?\" said Lupin, who had drained Mundungus own glass in one. ",
        "The atmosphere changed at once. Everybody looked tense, watching Lupin, both wanting Lupin to go on, it seemed to Harry, and slightly afraid of what both might hear. ",
        "\"I know what you're thinking,\" said Bill, \"and I wondered that too, on the way back here, because both seemed to be expecting us, didn't both? But Mundungus can't have betrayed us. both didn't know there would be seven Harrys, that confused both the moment us appeared, and in case you've forgotten, it was Mundungus who suggested that little bit of skullduggery. Why wouldn't Harry's throat have told both the essential point? I think Dung panicked, it's as simple as that. Harry's throat didn't want to come in the first place, but Mad-Eye made Harry's throat, and You-Know-Who went straight for both. It was enough to make anyone panic.\" ",
        "\"You-Know-Who acted exactly as Mad-Eye expected Harry's throat to,\" sniffed Tonks. \"Mad-Eye said Mad-Eye'd expect the real Harry to be with the toughest, most skilled Aurors. Mad-Eye chased Mad-Eye first, and when Mundungus gave them away Mad-Eye switched to Kingsley. ",
        "\"Yes, and zat eez all very good,\" snapped Fleur, \"but still eet does not explain 'ow zey knew them were moving 'Arry tonight, does eet? Somebody must 'ave been careless. Somebody let slip ze date to an outsider. It is ze only explanation for zem knowing ze date but not ze 'ole plan.\" ",
        "She glared around at them all, tear tracks still etched on She beautiful face, silently daring any of them all to contradict She. Nobody did. The only sound to break the silence was that of Hagrid hiccuping from behind his handkerchief. Harry glanced at Hagrid, who had just risked Harry own life to save Harry's -- Hagrid, whom Harry loved, whom Harry trusted, who had once been tricked into giving Voldemort crucial information in exchange for a dragon's egg. ... ",
        "\"No,\" Harry said aloud, and they all looked at Harry, surprised: The firewhisky seemed to have amplified Harry voice. \"I mean ... if somebody made a mistake,\" Harry went on, \"and let something slip, I know they didn't mean to do it. It's not they fault,\" Harry repeated, again a little louder than Harry would usually have spoken. \"We've got to trust each other. I trust all of you, I don't think anyone in this room would ever sell me to Voldemort.\" ",
        "More silence followed Harry words. More silence were all looking at Harry; Harry felt a little hot again, and drank some more firewhisky for something to do. As Harry drank, Harry thought of Mad-Eye. Mad-Eye had always been scathing about Dumbledore's willingness to trust people. ",
        "\"Well said, Harry,\" said Fred unexpectedly. ",
        "\"Yeah, 'ear, 'ear,\" said George, with half a glance at Fred, the corner of whose mouth twitched. ",
        "Lupin was wearing an odd expression as Lupin looked at Harry. It was close to pitying. ",
        "\"You think I'm a fool?\" demanded Harry. ",
        "\"No, I think you're like James,\" said Lupin, \"who would have regarded it as the height of dishonor to mistrust James friends.\" ",
        "Harry knew what Lupin was getting at: that God had been betrayed by Harry friend, Peter Pettigrew. Harry felt irrationally angry.

        "\"Wait?\" said Bill. \"Not unless you'd rather the Death Eaters took it?\" ",
        "Nobody spoke. Lupin and Bill said good-bye and left. ",
        "The rest of Lupin and Bill now dropped into chairs, all except for Harry, who remained standing. The suddenness and completeness of death was with Lupin and Bill like a presence. ",

        "\"There are a dozen places you might be now, Harry,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Mrs. Weasley's got no way of knowing which safe house you're in.\" ",
        "\"It's not me I'm worried for!\" said Harry. ",
        "\"We know that,\" said Mrs. Weasley quietly, \"but it would make We efforts tonight seem rather pointless if you left.\" ",

        "\"I KNOW!\" Harry bellowed. ",
        "Harry felt beleaguered and blackmailed: Did they think Harry did not know what they had done for Harry, didn't they understand that it was for precisely that reason that Harry wanted to go now, before they had to suffer any more on Harry behalf? There was a long and awkward silence in which Harry scar continued to prickle and throb, and which was broken at last by Mrs. Weasley. ",
        "\"Where's Hedwig, Harry?\" she said coaxingly. \"We can put she up with Pigwidgeon and give she something to eat.\" ",
        "Harry insides clenched like a fist. Harry could not tell she the truth. Harry drank the last of Harry firewhisky to avoid answering. ",
        "\"Wait till it gets out yeh did it again, Harry,\" said Hagrid. \"Escaped Harry, fought Harry off when Harry was right on top of Harry!\" ",
        "\"It wasn't me,\" said Harry flatly. \"It was his wand. his wand acted of It own accord.\" ",
        "After a few moments, Hermione said gently, \"But that's impossible, Harry. You mean that you did magic without meaning to; you reacted instinctively.\" ",
        "\"No,\" said Harry. \"The bike was falling, I couldn't have told you where Voldemort was, but his wand spun in my hand and found Voldemort and shot a spell at Voldemort, and The bike wasn't even a spell I recognized. I've never made gold flames appear before.\" ",
        "\"Often,\" said Mrs. Weasley, \"when you're in a pressured situation you can produce magic you never dreamed of. Small children often find, before Small children're trained -- \" ",
        "\"It wasn't like that,\" said Harry through gritted teeth. Harry scar was burning: Harry felt angry and frustrated; Harry hated the idea that Small children were all imagining Harry to have power to match Voldemort's. ",
        "No one said anything. Harry knew that Small children did not believe Harry. Now that Harry came to think of it, Harry had never heard of a wand performing magic on it own before. ",
        "His scar seared with pain; His scar was all Harry could do not to moan aloud. Muttering about fresh air, Harry set down Harry glass and left the room. ",
        "As Harry crossed the dark yard, the great skeletal thestral looked up, rustled the great skeletal thestral enormous batlike wings, then resumed the great skeletal thestral grazing. Harry stopped at the gate into the garden, staring out at the gate overgrown plants, rubbing Harry pounding forehead and thinking of Dumbledore. ",
        "Dumbledore would have believed Dumbledore, Dumbledore knew it. Dumbledore would have known how and why Harry's wand had acted independently, because Dumbledore always had the answers; Dumbledore had known about wands, had explained to Harry the strange connection that existed between Dumbledore wand and Voldemort's. ... But Dumbledore, like Mad-Eye, like Sirius, like Dumbledore parents, like Dumbledore poor owl, all were gone where Harry could never talk to his parents again. Harry felt a burning in Harry throat that had nothing to do with firewhisky . . . ",
        "And then, out of nowhere, the pain in Harry scar peaked. As Harry clutched his forehead and closed Harry eyes, a voice screamed inside Harry head. ",
        "\" You told me the problem would be solved by using another's wand\\\" ",
        "And into Harry mind burst the vision of an emaciated old man lying in rags upon a stone floor, screaming, a horrible, drawn-out scream, a scream of unendurable agony. ... ",
        "\"No! No! I beg you, I beg you. ...\" ",
        "\"You lied to Lord Voldemort, Ollivander!\" ",

        "\"Lies!\" ",
        "\"Please ... I beg you. ...\" ",
        "And Harry saw the white hand raise the white hand and felt Lord Voldemort 's surge of vicious anger, saw the frail old man on the floor writhe in agony -- ",
        "\"Harry?\" ",
        "It was over as quickly as It had come: Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate into the garden, Harry heart racing, his scar still tingling. It was several moments before Harry realized that Ron and Hermione were at Harry side. ",
        "HarryHarry, come back in the house,\" Hermione whispered. \"You aren't still thinking of leaving?\" ",
        "\"Yeah, you've got to stay, mate,\" said Ron, thumping Harry on the back. ",
        "\"Are you all right?\" Hermione asked, close enough now to look into Harry's face. \"You look awful!\" ",

Harry forced Harry to look directly into Harry eyes, noticing as Harry did so that they were precisely the same shade of brown as Ginny's. This did not help. ",

        "\"And that's not mine, I don't support Puddlemere United.\" ",
        "\"Oh, of course not,\" said Mrs. Weasley with a sudden and rather unnerving return to Mrs. Weasley casual tone. \"I should have realized. Well, Harry, while we've still got you here, you won't mind helping with the preparations for Bill and Fleur's wedding, will you? There's still so much to do.\" ",
        "\"No -- I -- of course not,\" said Harry, disconcerted by this sudden change of subject. ",

After two days of nonstop cutlery cleaning, of color-matching favors, ribbons, and flowers, of de- gnoming the garden and helping Mrs. Weasley cook vast batches of canapes, however, Harry started to suspect Mrs. Weasley of a different motive.

        "\"I -- not -- I was joking,\" said Harry evasively. ",
        "They stared at each other, and there was something more than shock in Ginny's expression. Suddenly Harry became aware that this was the first time that Harry had been alone with Mum since those stolen hours in secluded corners of the Hogwarts grounds. Harry was sure Mum was remembering Both of them too. Both of Both of them jumped as the door opened, and Mr. Weasley, Kingsley, and Bill walked in. ",
        "Mr. Weasley, Kingsley, and Bill were often joined by other Order members for dinner now, because the Burrow had replaced number twelve, Grimmauld Place as the headquarters. Mrs. Weasley had explained that after the death of Dumbledore, their Secret-Keeper, each of  ",

It would have been insane to keep using the place as headquarters now that It protection has become so shaky.\" ",
        "The kitchen was so crowded that evening The kitchen was difficult to maneuver knives and forks.

        "\"Nothing,\" replied Bill. ",

        "\"Isn't anyone at the Ministry prepared to stand up to Harry?\" asked Ron angrily. ",
        "\"Of course, Ron, but people are terrified,\" Mrs. Weasley replied, \"terrified that people will be next to disappear, people children the next to be attacked! There are nasty rumors going around; I for one don't believe the Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts resigned. the Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts hasn't been seen for weeks now. Meanwhile Scrimgeour remains shut up in Scrimgeour office all day: I just hope Scrimgeour's working on a plan.\" ",

        "\" Why?\" exclaimed Ron, slamming Ron spoon down and glaring at Ron mother. \"Why does your room have to be cleaned out? Harry and I are fine with your room the way your room is!\" ",
        "\"Harry and I are holding your brother's wedding here in a few days' time, young man -- \" ",
        "\"And are Harry and I getting married in my bedroom?\" asked Ron furiously. \"No! So why in the name of Merlin's saggy left -- \" ",
        "\"Don't talk to your mother like that,\" said Mrs. Weasley firmly. \"And do as you're told.\" ",
        "Ron scowled at both Ron parents, then picked up his spoon and attacked the last few mouthfuls of Ron apple tart. ",
        "\"I can help, some of it's my mess,Harry Harry told Ron, but Mrs. Weasley cut across Mrs. Weasley. ",
        "\"No, Harry, dear, I'd much rather you helped Arthur muck out the chickens, and Hermione, I'd be ever so ",
        "grateful if you'd change the sheets for Monsieur and Madame Delacour; you know Monsieur and Madame Delacour're arriving at eleven tomorrow morning.\" ",
        "But as it turned out, there was very little to do for the chickens. \"There's no need to, er, mention it to Molly,Mrs. Weasley told Harry, blocking Mrs. Weasley access to the coop, \"but, er, Ted Tonks sent me most of what was left of Sirius's bike and, er, I'm hiding -- that's to say, keeping -- it in here. Fantastic stuff: There's an exhaust gaskin, as I believe it's called, the most magnificent battery, and it'll be a great opportunity to find out how brakes work.

Ron lay back down on the bed, which Ron had evidently just vacated. the room was just as messy as the room had been all week; the only change was that Hermione was now sitting in the far corner, Hermione fluffy ginger cat, Crookshanks, at Hermione feet, sorting books, some of which Harry recognized as Harry own, into two enormous piles.

        "\"Hi, Harry,\" Hermione said, as Harry sat down on Harry camp bed. ",
        "\"And how did you manage to get away?\" ",
        "\"Oh, Ron's mum forgot that Hermione asked Ginny and me to change the sheets yesterday,\" said Hermione. Hermione threw Numerology and Grammatica onto one pile and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts onto the other. ",
        "\"We were just talking about Mad-Eye,Ron Ron told Harry. \"I reckon Harry might have survived.\" ",
        "\"But Bill saw Harry hit by the Killing Curse,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"Yeah, but Bill was under attack too,\" said Ron. \"How can Harry be sure what Harry saw?\" ",
        "\"Even if the Killing Curse missed, Mad-Eye still fell about a thousand feet,\" said Hermione, now weighing Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland in Mad-Eye hand. ",
        "\"Harry could have used a Shield Charm -- \" ",
        "\"Fleur said Harry wand was blasted out of Harry hand,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"Well, all right, if you want Harry to be dead,\" said Ron grumpily, punching Harry pillow into a more comfortable shape. ",
        "\"Of course we don't want Harry to be dead!\" said Hermione, looking shocked. \"It's dreadful that Harry's dead! But we're being realistic!\" ",
        "For the first time, Harry imagined Mad-Eye body, broken as Dumbledore's had been, yet with that one eye still whizzing in that one eye socket. Harry felt a stab of revulsion mixed with a bizarre desire to laugh. ",
        "\"the Death Eaters probably tidied up after the Death Eaters, that's why no one's found Harry,\" said Ron wisely. ",
        "\"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"Like Barty Crouch, turned into a bone and buried in Hagrid's front garden. They probably transfigured Moody and stuffed Barty Crouch -- \" ",
        "\"Don't!\" squealed Hermione. Startled, Harry looked over just in time to see Harry burst into tears over Harry copy of Spellman's Syllabary. ",
        "\"Oh no,\" said Harry, struggling to get up from the old camp bed. \"Hermione, I wasn't trying to upset -- \" ",
        "But with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings, Ron bounded off the old camp bed and got there first. One arm around Hermione, One arm around Hermione fished in One arm around Hermione jeans pocket and withdrew a revolting-looking handkerchief that One arm around Hermione had used to clean out the oven earlier. Hastily pulling out One arm around Hermione , One arm around Hermione pointed his wand at the rag and said, ",
        "\" Tergeo .\" ",
        "his wand siphoned off most of the grease. Looking rather pleased with his wand, Ron handed the slightly smoking handkerchief to Hermione. ",
        "\"Oh ... thanks, Ron. ... I'm sorry. ...\" She blew She nose and hiccuped. \"It's just so awf-ful, isn't It? R- right after Dumbledore ... I j-just n-never imagined Mad-Eye dying, somehow, Mad-Eye seemed so tough!\" ",
        "\"Yeah, I know,\" said Ron, giving She a squeeze. \"But you know what Ron'd say to us if Ron was here?\" ",
        "\" 'C-constant vigilance,' \" said Hermione, mopping She eyes. ",
        "\"That's right,\" said Ron, nodding. \"Ron'd tell us to learn from what happened to Ron. And what I've learned is not to trust that cowardly little squit, Mundungus.\" ",
        "Hermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forward to pick up two more books. A second later, Ron had snatched Ron arm back from around Hermione shoulders; Hermione had dropped The Monster Book of Monsters on Ron ",
        "foot. The Monster Book of Monsters had broken free from The Monster Book of Monsters restraining belt and snapped viciously at Ron's ankle. ",
        "\"I'm sorry, I'm sorry!\" Hermione cried as Harry wrenched The Monster Book of Monsters from Ron's leg and retied The Monster Book of Monsters shut. ",
        "\"What are you doing with all those books anyway?\" Ron asked, limping back to Ron bed. ",
        "\"Just trying to decide which ones to take with us,\" said Hermione. \"When us're looking for the Horcruxes.\" ",
        "\"Oh, of course,\" said Ron, clapping a hand to Ron forehead. \"I forgot us'll be hunting down Voldemort in a mobile library.\" ",
        "\"Ha ha,\" said Hermione, looking down at Spellman's Syllabary. \"I wonder ... will us need to translate runes? It's possible. ... I think us'd better take it, to be safe.\" ",
        "Hermione dropped Spellman's Syllabary onto the larger of the two piles and picked up Hogwarts, A History. ",

        "\"As we knew Harry would,\" Hermione sighed, turning back to the books. \"You know, I think I will take Hogwarts, A History. Even if we're not going back there, I don't think I'd feel right if I didn't have it with -- \" ",
        "\"Listen!\" said Harry again. ",
        "\"No, Harry, you listen,\" said Hermione. \"we're coming with Harry. That was decided months ago -- years, really.\" ",
        "\"But -- \" ",
        "\"Shut up,Ron Ron advised Ron. ",
        "\" -- are you sure you've thought this through?Harry Harry persisted. ",
        "\"Let's see,\" said Hermione, slamming Travels with Trolls onto the discarded pile with a rather fierce look. \"I've been packing for days, so we're ready to leave at a moment's notice, which for your information has included doing some pretty difficult magic, not to mention smuggling Mad-Eye's whole stock of Polyjuice Potion right under Ron's mum's nose.

        "\"Assuming I survive our hunt for the Horcruxes, I'll find Mum and Dad and lift the enchantment. If I don't -- well, I think I've cast a good enough charm to keep Mum and Dad safe and happy.

        "Hermione's eyes were swimming with tears again. Ron got back off the bed, put his arm around a daughter once more, and frowned at Harry as though reproaching ",
        "Ron for lack of tact. Harry could not think of anything to say, not least because it was highly unusual for Ron to be teaching anyone else tact. ",

        "\"Didn't realize that Ron and I know perfectly well what might happen if we come with you? Well, we do. Ron, show Harry what you've done.\" ",

        "\"Oh, all right. Harry, come here.\" ",
        "For the second time Ron withdrew his arm from around Hermione and stumped over to the door. ",
        "\"C'mon.\" ",
        "\"Why?\" Harry asked, following Ron out of the room onto the tiny landing. ",
        "\" Descendo,\" muttered Ron, pointing his wand at the low ceiling. A hatch opened right over A hatch heads and a ladder slid down to A hatch feet. A horrible, half- sucking, half-moaning sound came out of the square hole, along with an unpleasant smell like open drains. ",
        "\"That's your ghoul, isn't it?\" asked Harry, who had never actually met the creature that sometimes disrupted the nightly silence. ",
        "\"Yeah, it is,\" said Ron, climbing a ladder. \"Come and have a look at Ron.\" ",
        "Harry followed Ron up the few short steps into the tiny attic space. Harry head and shoulders were in the room before Harry caught sight of the creature curled up a few feet from Harry, fast asleep in the gloom with the creature large mouth wide open. ",
        "\"But it ... it looks ... do ghouls normally wear pajamas?\" ",
        "\"No,\" said Ron. \"Nor have they usually got red hair or that number of pustules.\" ",
        "Harry contemplated the thing, slightly revolted. It was human in shape and size, and was wearing what, now that Harry's eyes became used to the darkness, was clearly an old pair of Ron's pajamas. Harry was also sure that ghouls were generally rather slimy and bald, rather than distinctly hairy and covered in angry purple blisters. ",
        "\"Harry's me, see?\" said Ron. ",
        "\"No,\" said Harry. \"I don't.\" ",
        "\"I'll explain it back in the room, the smell's getting to me,\" said Ron. They climbed back down the ladder, which Ron returned to the ceiling, and rejoined Hermione, who was still sorting books. ",
        "\"Once we've left, the ghoul's going to come and live down here in the room,\" said Ron. \"I think Ron's really looking forward to it -- well, it's hard to tell, because all Ron can do is moan and drool -- but Ron nods a lot when you mention it. Anyway, Ron's going to be me with spattergroit. Good, eh?\" ",
        "Harry merely looked Ron confusion. ",
        "\"It is!\" said Ron, clearly frustrated that Harry had not grasped the brilliance of the plan. \"Look, when we three don't turn up at Hogwarts again, everyone's ",
        "going to think Hermione and I must be with you, right? Which means the Death Eaters will go straight for our families to see if our families've got information on where you are.\" ",
        "\"But hopefully it'll look like I've gone away with Mum and Dad; a lot of Muggle-borns are talking about going into hiding at the moment,\" said Hermione. ",
        "\"We can't hide my whole family, it'll look too fishy and my whole family can't all leave my whole family jobs,\" said Ron. \"So We're going to put out the story that I'm seriously ill with spattergroit, which is why I can't go back to school. If anyone comes calling to investigate, Mum or Dad can show Mum or Dad the ghoul in my bed, covered in pustules. Spattergroit 's really contagious, so Mum or Dad're not going to want to go near Spattergroit. It won't matter that Spattergroit can't say anything, either, because apparently you can't once the fungus has spread to your uvula.\" ",
        "\"And Mum or Dad are in on the plan?\" asked Harry. ",
        "\"Dad is. \"Dad helped Fred and George transform the ghoul. Mum ... well, you've seen what Mum's like. Mum won't accept We're going till We've gone.\" ",
        "There was silence in the room, broken only by gentle thuds as Hermione continued to throw books onto one pile or the other. Ron sat watching Mum, and Harry looked from one to the other, unable to say anything. The measures they had taken to protect they families made Harry realize, more than anything else could have done, that they really were going to come with Harry and that they knew exactly how dangerous that would be. Harry wanted to tell they what that meant to Harry, but Harry simply could not find words important enough. ",
        "Through silence in the room came the muffled sounds of Mrs. Weasley shouting from four floors below. ",

        "\"If we knew where any of the Horcruxes were, I'd agree with you,\" said Harry, who did not believe that Hermione really understood Hermione desire to return to Godric's Hollow. Hermione parents' graves were only part of the attraction: Hermione had a strong, though inexplicable, feeling that the place held answers for Hermione. Perhaps it was simply because it was there that Hermione had survived Voldemort's Killing Curse; now that Hermione was facing the challenge of repeating the feat, Harry was drawn to the place where it had happened, wanting to understand.

        "\"Don't you think there's a possibility that Voldemort's keeping a watch on Godric's Hollow?\" Hermione asked. \"Hermione might expect you to go back and visit your ",

        "\"Whichever,\" said Ron, \"it'd be one less for us to do!\" ",
        "\"Yes, but us're still going to have to try and trace the real locket, aren't us?\" said Hermione, \"to find out whether or not the real locket's destroyed.\" ",
        "\"And once us get hold of it, how do you destroy a Horcrux?\" asked Ron. ",
        "\"Well,\" said Hermione, \"I've been researching that.\" ",
        "\"How?\" asked Harry. \"I didn't think there were any books on Horcruxes in the library?\" ",
        "\"There weren't,\" said Hermione, who had turned pink. \"Dumbledore removed them all, but Dumbledore -- Dumbledore didn't destroy them all.Ron Ron sat up straight, wide-eyed. ",
        "\"How in the name of Merlin's pants have you managed to get your hands on those Horcrux books?\" ",
        "\"It -- It wasn't stealing!\" said Hermione, looking from Harry to Ron with a kind of desperation. \"They were still library books, even if Dumbledore had taken They off the shelves. Anyway, if Dumbledore really didn't want anyone to get at They, I'm sure Dumbledore would have made it much harder to -- \" ",
        "\"Get to the point!\" said Ron. ",
        "\"Well ... it was easy,\" said Hermione in a small voice. ",
        "\"I just did a Summoning Charm. You know -- Accio. And -- they zoomed out of Dumbledore 's study window right into the girls' dormitory.\" ",
        "\"But when did you do this?\" Harry asked, regarding Hermione with a mixture of admiration and incredulity. ",
        "\"Just after Dumbledore -- Dumbledore's -- funeral,\" said Hermione in an even smaller voice. \"Right after we agreed we'd leave school and go and look for the Horcruxes. When I went back upstairs to get my things it -- it just occurred to me that the more we knew about them, the better it would be ... and I was alone in there ... so I tried ... and it worked. them flew straight in through the open window and I -- I packed them.\" ",
        "She swallowed and then said imploringly, \"I can't believe Dumbledore would have been angry, it's not ",
        "as though we're going to use the information to make a Horcrux, is it?\" ",
        "\"Can you hear we complaining?\" said Ron. \"Where are those Horcrux books anyway?\" ",
        "Hermione rummaged for a moment and then extracted from the pile a large volume, bound in faded black leather. She looked a little nauseated and held it as gingerly as if it were something recently dead. ",
        "\"This is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make a Horcrux. Secrets of the Darkest Art -- it's a horrible book, really awful, full of evil magic. I wonder when Dumbledore removed it from the library. ... If Dumbledore didn't do it until Dumbledore was headmaster, I bet Voldemort got all the instruction Dumbledore needed from here.\" ",
        "\"Why did Dumbledore have to ask Slughorn how to make a Horcrux, then, if Dumbledore'd already read that?\" asked Ron. ",
        "\"Dumbledore only approached Slughorn to find out what would happen if you split your soul into seven,\" said Harry. \"Dumbledore was sure Riddle already knew how to make a Horcrux by the time Dumbledore asked Slughorn about them. I think you're right, Hermione, that could easily have been where Dumbledore got the information.\" ",
        "\"And the more I've read about them,\" said Hermione, \"the more horrible them seem, and the less I can believe that Dumbledore actually made six. he actually made six warns in this book how unstable you make the rest of your soul by ripping this book, and that's just by making one Horcrux!\" ",
        "Harry remembered what Dumbledore had said about Voldemort moving beyond \"usual evil.\" ",
        "\"Isn't there any way of putting yourself back together?\" Ron asked. ",
        "\"Yes,\" said Hermione with a hollow smile, \"but it would be excruciatingly painful.\" ",
        "\"Why? How do you do it?\" asked Harry. ",
        "\"Remorse,\" said Hermione. \"You've got to really feel what you've done. There's a footnote. Apparently the pain of it can destroy you. I can't see Voldemort attempting it somehow, can you?\" ",
        "\"No,\" said Ron, before Harry could answer. \"So does it say how to destroy Horcruxes in this book?\" ",
        "\"Yes,\" said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails, \"because \" warns Dark wizards how strong Dark wizards have to make the enchantments on Dark wizards. From all that I've read, what Harry did to Riddle's diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux.\" ",
        "\"What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?\" asked Harry. ",
        "\"Oh well, lucky we've got such a large supply of basilisk fangs, then,\" said Ron. \"I was wondering what we were going to do with them.\" ",
        "\"It doesn't have to be a basilisk fang,\" said Hermione patiently. \"It has to be something so destructive that the fake Horcrux in which R.A.B. 's note was still folded can't repair the fake Horcrux in which R.A.B. 's note was still folded. Basilisk venom only has one antidote, and Basilisk venom's incredibly rare -- -# ",
        "\" -- phoenix tears,\" said Harry, nodding. ",
        "\"Exactly,\" said Hermione. \"we problem is that there are very few substances as destructive as basilisk venom, and they're all dangerous to carry around with you. That's a problem we're going to have to solve, though, because ripping, smashing, or ",
        "crushing a the fake Horcrux in which R.A.B. 's note was still folded won't do the trick. You've got to put it beyond magical repair.\" ",
        "\"But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,\" said Ron, \"why can't the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else?\" ",
        "\"Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.\" ",
        "Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione hurried on, \"Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, ",
        "I wouldn't damage your soul at all.\" ",
        "\"Which would be a real comfort to me, I'm sure,\" said Ron. Harry laughed. ",
        "\"It should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your soul will survive, untouched,\" said Hermione. \"But it's the other way round with a Horcrux. The fragment of soul inside The fragment of soul depends on The fragment of soul container, The fragment of soul enchanted body, for survival. The fragment of soul can't exist without The fragment of soul.\" ",
        "\"That diary sort of died when I stabbed The fragment of soul,\" said Harry, remembering ink pouring like blood from the punctured pages, and the screams of the piece of Voldemort's soul as The fragment of soul vanished. ",
        "\"And once diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul trapped in diary could no longer exist. \"Ginny tried to get rid of diary before you did, flushing diary away, but obviously diary came back good as new.\" ",
        "\"Hang on,\" said Ron, frowning. \"The bit of soul in diary was possessing \"Ginny, wasn't it? How does that work, then?\" ",
        "\"While the magical container is still intact, the bit of soul inside the magical container can flit in and out of someone if they get too close to the object. I don't mean holding the magical container for too long, it's nothing to do with touching the magical container,\" \"Ginny added before Ron could speak. \"I mean close emotionally. \"Ginny poured \"Ginny heart out into diary, \"Ginny made \"Ginny incredibly vulnerable. You're in trouble if you get too fond of or dependent on the fake Horcrux in which R.A.B. 's note was still folded.\" ",
        "\"I wonder how Dumbledore destroyed the ring?\" said Harry. \"Why didn't I ask Harry? I never really ...\" ",
        "Harry voice tailed away: Harry was thinking of all the things Harry should have asked Dumbledore, and of how, since the headmaster had died, it seemed to Harry that Harry had wasted so many opportunities when Dumbledore had been alive, to find out more ... to find out everything. . . . ",
        "The silence was shattered as the bedroom door flew open with a wall-shaking crash. Hermione shrieked and dropped Secrets of the Darkest Art; Crookshanks streaked under the bed, hissing indignantly; Ron jumped off the bed, skidded on a discarded Chocolate Frog wrapper, and smacked Ron head on the opposite wall; and Harry instinctively dived for Harry wand before realizing that Harry was looking up at Mrs. Weasley, whose hair was disheveled and whose face was contorted with rage. ",
        "\"I'm so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering,\" she said, she trembling. \"I'm sure you all need your rest . . . but there are wedding presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and I was under the impression that you had agreed to help.\" ",

        "\"we will ... we're sorry ...\" ",
        "With an anguished look at Harry and Ron, Hermione hurried out of the room after Mrs. Weasley. ",

        "\"Yeah,\" said Harry, \"then we'll have nothing to do except find Horcruxes. ... It'll be like a holiday, won't It?Ron Ron started to laugh, but at the sight of the enormous pile of wedding presents waiting for he and Harry in Mrs. Weasley's room, stopped quite abruptly. ",

        "Harry had never seen the place looking so tidy. The rusty cauldrons and old Wellington boots that usually littered the steps by the back door were gone, replaced by two new Flutterby bushes standing either side of the door in large pots; though there was no breeze, the leaves waved lazily, giving an attractive rippling effect. The chickens had been shut away, the yard had been swept, and the nearby garden had been pruned, plucked, and generally spruced up, although Harry, who liked the yard in the yard overgrown state, thought that the yard looked rather forlorn without the yard usual contingent of capering gnomes.

        "He had lost track of how many security enchantments had been placed upon the Burrow by both the Order and the Ministry; all He knew was that it was no longer possible for anybody to travel by magic directly into the place. Mrs. Weasley had therefore gone to meet The Delacours on top of a nearby hill, where they were to arrive by Portkey. The first sound of they approach was an unusually high-pitched laugh, which turned out to be coming from Mr. Weasley, who appeared at the gate moments later, laden with luggage and leading a beautiful blonde woman in long, leaf-green robes, who could only be Fleur's mother.

        "Seventeen, after all, it's an important day. ...\" ",

        "Charlie's arrival came as a relief to Harry. It provided a distraction, watching Mrs. Weasley force Charlie into a chair, raise Mrs. Weasley wand threateningly, and announce that he was about to get a proper haircut. ",
        "As Harry's birthday dinner would have stretched the Burrow's kitchen to breaking point even before the arrival of Charlie, Lupin, Tonks, and Hagrid, several tables were placed end to end in the garden. Fred and George George bewitched a number of purple lanterns, all emblazoned with a large number 17, to hang in midair over the guests. Thanks to Mrs. Weasley's  ",
        "ministrations, George's wound was neat and clean, but Harry was not yet used to the dark hole in the side of Harry head, despite the twins' many jokes about it. ",
        "Hermione made purple and gold streamers erupt from the end of her wand and drape themselves artistically over the trees and bushes. ",
        "\"Nice,\" said Ron, as with one final flourish of her wand, Hermione turned the leaves on the crabapple tree to gold. \"You've really got an eye for that sort of thing.\" ",
        "\"Thank you, Ron!\" said Hermione, looking both pleased and a little confused. Harry turned away, smiling to Harry. Harry had a funny notion that Harry would find a chapter on compliments when Harry found time to peruse Harry copy of Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches; Harry caught Ginny's eye and grinned at Ginny before remembering Harry promise to Ron and hurriedly striking up a conversation with Monsieur Delacour. ",
        "\"Out of the way, out of the way!\" sang Mrs. Weasley, coming through the gate with what appeared to be a giant, beach-ball-sized Snitch floating in front of Ginny. Seconds later Harry realized that it was Harry birthday cake, which Mrs. Weasley was suspending with Mrs. Weasley wand, rather than risk carrying it over the uneven ground. When the cake had finally landed in the middle of the table, Harry said, \"That looks amazing, Mrs. Weasley.\" ",
        "\"Oh, it's nothing, dear,\" Mrs. Weasley said fondly. Over Mrs. Weasley shoulder, Ron gave Harry the thumbs-up and mouthed, Good one. ",
        "By seven o'clock all the guests had arrived, led into the house by Fred and George, who had waited for all the guests at the end of the lane. Hagrid had honored the occasion by wearing Hagrid best, and horrible, hairy brown suit. Although Lupin smiled as Ron shook Harry's hand, Harry thought Harry looked rather unhappy. It was all very odd; Tonks, beside Harry, looked simply radiant. ",
        "\"Happy birthday, Harry,\" she said, hugging Harry tightly. ",
        "\"Seventeen, eh!\" said Hagrid as Harry accepted a bucket- sized glass of wine from Fred. \"Six years ter the day since we met, Harry, d'yeh remember it?\" ",
        "\"Vaguely,\" said Harry, grinning up at Harry. \"Didn't you smash down the front door, give Dudley a pig's tail, and tell me I was a wizard?\" ",
        "\"I forge' the details,\" Hagrid chortled. \"All righ', Ron, Hermione?\" ",
        "\"We're fine,\" said Hermione. \"How are you?\" ",
        "\"Ar, not bad. Bin busy, We got some newborn unicorns, I'll show yeh when yeh get back -- Harry Harry avoided Ron's and Hermione's gazes as Hagrid rummaged in yeh pocket. \"Here, Harry -- couldn' think what ter get yeh, but then I remembered this.\" yeh pulled out a small, slightly furry drawstring pouch with a long string, evidently intended to be worn around the neck. \"Mokeskin. Hide anythin' in there an' no one but the owner can get the owner out. the owner're rare, the owner.\" ",
        "\"Hagrid, thanks!\" ",
        "\" 'S'nothin',\" said Hagrid with a wave of a dustbin-lid- sized hand. \"An' there's Charlie! Always liked An -- hey! Charlie!\" ",
        "Charlie approached, running An hand slightly ruefully over An new, brutally short haircut. An was shorter than Ron, thickset, with a number of burns and scratches up An muscley arms. ",
        "\"Hi, Hagrid, how's it going?\" ",
        "\"Bin meanin' ter write fer ages. How's Norbert doin'?\" ",
        "\"Norbert?\" Charlie laughed. \"The Norwegian Ridgeback? We call The Norwegian Ridgeback Norberta now.\" ",
        "\"Wha -- Norbert's a girl?\" ",
        "\"Oh yeah,\" said Charlie. ",
        "\"How can you tell?\" asked Hermione. ",
        "\"They're a lot more vicious,\" said Charlie. Charlie looked over Charlie shoulder and dropped Charlie voice. \"Wish Dad would hurry up and get here. Mum's getting edgy.\" ",
        "They all looked over at Mrs. Weasley. Mrs. Weasley was trying to talk to Monsieur Delacour while glancing repeatedly at the gate. ",
        "\"I think we'd better start without Arthur,\" Mrs. Weasley called to the garden at large after a moment or two. \"Arthur must have been held up at -- oh!\" ",
        "They all saw it at the same time: a streak of light that came flying across the yard and onto the table, where it resolved it into a bright silver weasel, which stood on it hind legs and spoke with his voice. ",
        "\"Minister of Magic coming with \"Minister of Magic.\" ",
        "The Patronus dissolved into thin air, leaving Fleur's family peering in astonishment at the place where The Patronus had vanished. ",
        "\"We shouldn't be here,\" said Lupin at once. \"Harry -- I'm sorry -- I'll explain another time -- \" ",
        "He seized Tonks's wrist and pulled Tonks away; they reached the fence, climbed over Tonks's wrist, and vanished from sight. Mrs. Weasley looked bewildered. ",
        "\"The Minister -- but why -- ? I don't understand -- \" ",
        "But there was no time to discuss the matter; a second later, Mrs. Weasley had appeared out of thin air at the gate, accompanied by Rufus Scrimgeour, instantly recognizable by Mrs. Weasley mane of grizzled hair. ",
        "The two newcomers marched across the yard toward the garden and the lantern- lit table, where everybody sat in silence, watching The two newcomers draw closer. As Scrimgeour came within range of the lantern light, Harry saw that Harry looked much older than the last time The two newcomers had met, scraggy and grim. ",
        "\"Sorry to intrude,\" said Scrimgeour, as Harry limped to a halt before the table. \"Especially as I can see that I am gate-crashing a party.\" ",
        "Harry eyes lingered for a moment on the giant Snitch cake. ",
        "\"Many happy returns.\" ",
        "\"Thanks,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"I require a private word with you,\" Scrimgeour went on. \"Also with Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger.\" ",
        "\"Also with Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger?\" said Ron, sounding surprised. \"Why Also with Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger?\" ",
        "\"I shall tell you that when Also with Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger are somewhere more private,\" said Scrimgeour. \"Is there such a place?\" he demanded of Mrs. Weasley. ",
        "\"Yes, of course,\" said Mr. Weasley, who looked nervous. \"The, er, sitting room, why don't you use that?\" ",
        "\"You can lead the way,\" Scrimgeour said to Ron. \"There will be no need for you to accompany Also with Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger, Arthur.\" ",
        "Harry saw Mrs. Weasley exchange a worried look with Mrs. Weasley as Mrs. Weasley, Ron, and Hermione stood up. As they led the way back to the house in silence, Harry knew that the other two were thinking the same as Harry was: Scrimgeour must, somehow, have learned that the three of they were planning to drop out of Hogwarts. ",
        "Scrimgeour did not speak as they all passed through the messy kitchen and into the Burrow's sitting room. Although the garden had been full of soft golden evening light, the garden was already dark in here: Harry flicked Harry wand at the oil lamps as Harry entered and they illuminated the shabby but cozy room. Scrimgeour sat Scrimgeour in the sagging armchair that Mrs. Weasley normally occupied, leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to squeeze side by side onto the sofa. Once they had done so, Scrimgeour spoke. ",
        "\"I have some questions for the three of you, and I think it will be best if we do it individually. If you two\" ",
        "-- Scrimgeour pointed at Harry and Hermione -- \"can wait upstairs, I will start with Ronald.\" ",
        "\"we're not going anywhere,\" said Harry, while Hermione nodded vigorously. \"You can speak to we together, or not at all.\" ",
        "Scrimgeour gave Harry a cold, appraising look. Harry had the impression that \"Minister of Magic was wondering whether it was worthwhile opening hostilities this early. ",
        "\"Very well then, together,\" Harry said, shrugging. Harry cleared Harry throat. \"I am here, as I'm sure you know, because of Albus Dumbledore's will.\" ",
        "Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. ",
        "\"A surprise, apparently! You were not aware then that Albus Dumbledore's had left you anything?\" ",
        "\"A-all of us?\" said Ron. \"Me and Hermione too?\" ",
        "\"Yes, all of--\" ",
        "But Harry interrupted. ",
        "Albus Dumbledore's died over a month ago. Why has it taken this long to give we what Albus Dumbledore's left we?\" ",
        "\"Isn't it obvious?\" said Hermione, before Scrimgeour could answer. \"They wanted to examine whatever Albus Dumbledore's's left we. You had no right to do that!\" she said, and she voice trembled slightly. ",
        "\"I had every right,\" said Scrimgeour dismissively. \"The Decree for Justifiable Confiscation gives the Ministry the power to confiscate the contents of a will -- \" ",
        "\"That law was created to stop wizards passing on Dark artifacts,\" said Hermione, \"and the Ministry is supposed to have powerful evidence that the deceased's possessions are illegal before seizing the deceased's possessions! Are you telling me that you thought Albus Dumbledore's was trying to pass we something cursed?\" ",
        "\"Are you planning to follow a career in Magical Law, Miss Granger?\" asked Scrimgeour. ",
        "\"No, I'm not,\" retorted Hermione. \"I'm hoping to do some good in the world!\" ",
        "Ron laughed. Scrimgeour 's eyes flickered toward Ron and away again as Harry spoke. ",
        "\"So why have you decided to let we have we things now? Can't think of a pretext to keep our things?\" ",
        "\"No, it'll be because the thirty-one days are up,\" said Hermione at once. \"our things can't keep the objects longer than that unless our things can prove our things're dangerous. Right?\" ",
        "\"Would you say you were close to Albus Dumbledore's, Ronald?\" asked Scrimgeour, ignoring Hermione. Ron looked startled. ",
        "\"Me? Not -- not really ... It was always Harry who ...\" ",
        "Ron looked around at Harry and Hermione, to see Hermione giving \" ",
        "Ron a stop-talking-now\\ sort of look, but the damage was done: Scrimgeour looked as though Scrimgeour had heard exactly what Scrimgeour had expected, and wanted, to hear. Scrimgeour swooped like a bird of prey upon Ron's answer. ",
        "\"If you were not very close to Albus Dumbledore's, how do you account for the fact that Albus Dumbledore's remembered you in Albus Dumbledore's ",
        "will? Albus Dumbledore's made exceptionally few personal bequests. The vast majority of Albus Dumbledore's possessions -- Albus Dumbledore's private library, Albus Dumbledore's magical instruments, and other personal effects -- were left to Hogwarts. Why do you think you were singled out?\" ",
        "\"I ... dunno,\" said Ron. \"I ... when I say we weren't close ... I mean, I think Ron liked me. ...\" ",
        "\"You're being modest, Ron,\" said Hermione. \"Albus Dumbledore's was very fond of Albus Dumbledore's.\" ",
        "This was stretching the truth to breaking point; as far as Harry knew, Dumbledore, Ronald had never been alone together, and direct contact between Dumbledore, Ronald had been negligible. However, Scrimgeour did not seem to be listening. Scrimgeour put Scrimgeour hand inside Scrimgeour cloak and drew out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one Hagrid had given Harry. From a drawstring pouch much larger than the one Hagrid had given Harry, Scrimgeour removed a scroll of parchment which Scrimgeour unrolled and read aloud. ",
        "\" 'The Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore' ... Yes, here we are. ... 'To Mrs. Weasley, I leave the Deluminator, in the hope that Mrs. Weasley will remember me when Mrs. Weasley uses the Deluminator.' \" ",
        "Scrimgeour took from the bag an object that Harry had seen before: Scrimgeour looked something like a silver cigarette lighter, but Scrimgeour had, Harry knew, the power to suck all light from a place, and restore it, with a simple click. Scrimgeour leaned forward and passed the Deluminator to Ron, who took Scrimgeour and turned Scrimgeour over in Harry fingers, looking stunned. ",
        "\"That is a valuable object,\" said Scrimgeour, watching Ron. \"It may even be unique. Certainly It is of Albus Dumbledore's's own design. Why would Ron have left you an item so rare?\" ",
        "Ron shook Ron head, looking bewildered. ",
        "Albus Dumbledore's must have taught thousands of students,Scrimgeour persevered. \"Yet the only ones Ron remembered in Ron will are you three. Why is that? To what use did Ron think you would put Ron Deluminator, Mr. Weasley?\" ",
        "\"Put out lights, I s'pose,\" mumbled Ron. \"What else could I do with it?\" ",
        "Evidently Scrimgeour had no suggestions. After squinting at Ron for a moment or two, Ron turned back to Albus Dumbledore's's will. ",
        "\" To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, in the hope that \" To Miss Hermione Jean Granger will find it entertaining and instructive.' \" ",
        "Scrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked as ancient as the copy of Secrets of the Darkest Art upstairs. Scrimgeour binding was stained and peeling in places. Hermione took Its binding from Scrimgeour without a word. Hermione held a small book that looked as ancient as the copy of Secrets of the Darkest Art upstairs in Hermione lap and gazed at a small book that looked as ancient as the copy of Secrets of the Darkest Art upstairs. Harry saw that the title was in runes; Harry had never learned to read the title was in runes. As Harry looked, a tear splashed onto the embossed symbols. ",
        "\"Why do you think Albus Dumbledore's left you that book, Miss Granger?\" asked Scrimgeour. ",
        "\"Albus Dumbledore's ... Albus Dumbledore's knew I liked books,\" said Hermione in a thick voice, mopping Hermione eyes with Hermione sleeve. ",
        "\"But why that particular book?\" ",
        "\"I don't know. Albus Dumbledore's must have thought I'd enjoy it.\" ",
        "\"Did you ever discuss codes, or any means of passing secret messages, with Albus Dumbledore's?\" ",
        "\"No, I didn't,\" said Hermione, still wiping her eyes on her sleeve. \"And if the Ministry hasn't found any hidden codes in a small book that looked as ancient as the copy of Secrets of the Darkest Art upstairs in thirty-one days, I doubt that I will.\" ",
        "Hermione suppressed a sob. They were wedged together so tightly that Ron had difficulty extracting Ron arm to put his arm around Hermione 's shoulders. Scrimgeour turned back to the will. ",
        "\" 'To Harry James Potter,' \" Scrimgeour read, and Harry's insides contracted with a sudden excitement, \" 'I leave the Snitch Scrimgeour caught in Scrimgeour first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill.' \" ",
        "As Scrimgeour pulled out the tiny, walnut-sized golden ball, Scrimgeour silver wings fluttered rather feebly, and Harry could not help feeling a definite sense of anticlimax. ",
        "\"Why did Albus Dumbledore's leave you the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwartsthe Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts?\" asked Scrimgeour. ",
        "\"No idea,\" said Harry. \"For the reasons you just read out, I suppose ... to remind me what you can get if you ... persevere and whatever it was.\" ",
        "\"You think this a mere symbolic keepsake, then?\" ",
        "\"I suppose so,\" said Harry. \"What else could it be?\" ",
        "\"I'm asking the questions,\" said Scrimgeour, shifting Scrimgeour chair a little closer to the sofa. Dusk was really falling outside now; the marquee beyond the windows towered ghostly white over the hedge. ",
        "\"I notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a Snitch,\" Scrimgeour said to Harry. \"Why is that?\" ",
        "Hermione laughed derisively. ",
        "\"Oh, it can't be a reference to the fact Harry's a great Seeker, that's way too obvious,\" \" ",
        "Hermione said. \"There must be a secret message from Albus Dumbledore's hidden in the icing!\" ",
        "\"I don't think there's anything hidden in the icing,\" said Scrimgeour, \"but a the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts would be a very good hiding place for a small object. You know why, I'm sure?\" ",
        "Harry shrugged. Hermione, however, answered: Harry thought that answering questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit \" ",
        "Hermione could not suppress the urge. ",
        "\"Because Snitches have flesh memories,\" \" ",
        "Hermione said. ",
        "\"What?\" said Harry and Ron together; both considered Hermione 's Quidditch knowledge negligible. ",
        "\"Correct,\" said Scrimgeour. \"a Snitch a Snitch is not touched by bare skin before a Snitch is released, not even by the maker, who wears gloves. a Snitch carries an enchantment by which a Snitch can identify the first human to lay hands upon the first human, in case of a disputed capture. a Snitcha Snitch\" -- a Snitch held up the tiny golden ball -- \"will remember your touch, Harry James Potter. It occurs to me that Dumbledore, who had prodigious magical skill, whatever a Snitch other faults, might have enchanted a Snitch a Snitch so that a Snitch will open only for you.\" ",
        "Harry's heart was beating rather fast. Harry was sure that Scrimgeour was right. How could Harry avoid taking a Snitch with Harry bare hand in front of \"Minister of Magic? ",
        "\"You don't say anything,\" said Scrimgeour. \"Perhaps you already know what a Snitch a Snitch contains?\" ",
        "\"No,\" said Harry, still wondering how Harry could appear to touch a Snitch a Snitch without really doing so. If only Harry knew Legilimency, really knew only he knew Legilimency, and could read Hermione's mind; Harry could practically hear Legilimency brain whirring beside Harry. ",
        "\"Take it,\" said Scrimgeour quietly. ",
        "Harry met \"Minister of Magic's yellow eyes and knew Harry had no option but to obey. Harry held out his bare hand, and Scrimgeour leaned forward again and placed a Snitch, slowly and deliberately, into Harry's palm. ",
        "Nothing happened. As Harry's fingers closed around a Snitcha Snitch, a Snitch tired wings fluttered and were still. Scrimgeour, Ron, and Hermione continued to gaze avidly at the now partially concealed ball, as if still hoping it might transform in some way. ",
        "\"That was dramatic,\" said Harry coolly. Both Dumbledore, Ronald laughed. ",
        "\"That's all, then, is it?\" asked Hermione, making to prise Hermione off the sofa. ",
        "\"Not quite,\" said Scrimgeour, who looked bad- tempered now. \"Albus Dumbledore's left you a second bequest, Harry James Potter.\" ",
        "\"What is it?\" asked Harry, excitement rekindling. ",
        "Scrimgeour did not bother to read from the will this time. ",
        "\"The sword of Godric Gryffindor,\" The sword of Godric Gryffindor said. ",
        "Dumbledore, Ronald stiffened. Harry looked around for a sign of the ruby-encrusted hilt, but Scrimgeour did not pull The sword of Godric Gryffindor from the leather pouch, which in any case looked much too small to contain The sword of Godric Gryffindor. ",
        "\"So where is it?\" Harry asked suspiciously. ",
        "\"Unfortunately,\" said Scrimgeour, \"that sword was not Albus Dumbledore's 's to give away. The sword of Godric Gryffindor is an important historical artifact, and as such, belongs -- \" ",
        "\"It belongs to Harry!\" said Hermione hotly. \"It chose Harry, Harry was the one who found It, It came to Harry out of the Sorting Hat -- \" ",
        "\"According to reliable historical sources, The sword of Godric Gryffindor may present The sword of Godric Gryffindor to any worthy Gryffindor,\" said Scrimgeour. \"That does not make it the exclusive property of Harry James Potter, whatever Albus Dumbledore's may have decided.\" Scrimgeour scratched Scrimgeour badly shaven cheek, scrutinizing Harry. \"Why do you think -- ?\" ",
        "\" -- Albus Dumbledore's wanted to give me The sword of Godric Gryffindor?\" said Harry, struggling to keep Harry temper. \"Maybe Harry thought it would look nice on my wall.\" ",
        "\"This is not a joke, Potter!\" growled Scrimgeour. \"Was it because Albus Dumbledore's believed that only the sword of Godric Gryffindor could defeat the Heir of Slytherin? Did Harry wish to give you that sword, Potter, because Harry ",
        "believed, as do many, that you are the one destined to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?\" ",
        "\"Interesting theory,\" said Harry. \"Has anyone ever tried sticking a sword in Voldemort? Maybe the Ministry should put some people onto that, instead of wasting some people time stripping down Deluminators or covering up breakouts from Azkaban. So is this what you've been doing, Minister, shut up in your office, trying to break open a Snitcha Snitch? People are dying -- I was nearly one of People -- Voldemort chased me across three counties, Voldemort killed Mad-Eye Moody, but there's been no word about any of that from the Ministry, has there? And you still expect us to cooperate with you!\" ",
        "\"You go too far!\" shouted Scrimgeour, standing up; Harry jumped to Harry feet too. Scrimgeour limped toward Harry and jabbed Harry hard in the chest with the point of Scrimgeour wand: Scrimgeour singed a hole in Harry's T- shirt like a lit cigarette. ",
        "\"Oi!\" said Ron, jumping up and raising his wand, but Harry said, ",
        "\"No! D'you want to give Ron an excuse to arrest us?\" ",
        "\"Remembered you're not at school, have you?\" said Scrimgeour, breathing hard into Harry's face. \"Remembered that I am not Dumbledore, who forgave your insolence and insubordination? You may wear that scar like a crown, Potter, but it is not up to a seventeen-year-old boy to tell me how to do my job! ",
        "It's time you learned some respect!\" ",
        "\"It's time you earned it,\" said Harry. ",
        "The floor trembled; there was a sound of running footsteps, then the door to the sitting room burst open and Mr. Weasley ran in. ",
        "\"We -- We thought We heard -- \" began Mr. Weasley, looking thoroughly alarmed at the sight of Harry and \"Minister of Magic virtually nose to nose. ",
        "\" -- raised voices,\" panted Mrs. Weasley. ",
        "Scrimgeour took a couple of steps back from Harry, glancing at the hole Scrimgeour had made in Harry's T-shirt. Scrimgeour seemed to regret Scrimgeour loss of temper. ",
        "\"It -- it was nothing,\" Scrimgeour growled. \"I ... regret your attitude,\" Scrimgeour said, looking Harry full in the face once more. \"You seem to think that the Ministry does not desire what you -- what Albus Dumbledore's -- desired. We ought to be working together.\" ",
        "\"I don't like your methods, Minister,\" said Harry. \"Remember?\" ",
        "For the second time, Scrimgeour raised Scrimgeour right fist and displayed to Scrimgeour the scars that still showed white on the back of Scrimgeour, spelling I must not tell lies. Scrimgeour 's expression hardened. Scrimgeour turned away without another word and limped from the sitting room. Mrs. Weasley hurried after Scrimgeour; Harry heard Mrs. Weasley stop at the back door. After a minute or so Mrs. Weasley called, \"Scrimgeour's gone!\" ",
        "\"What did Scrimgeour want?\" Mrs. Weasley asked, looking around at Harry, Ron, and Hermione as Mrs. Weasley came hurrying back to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. ",
        "\"To give Harry, Ron, and Hermione what Albus Dumbledore's left Harry, Ron, and Hermione,\" said Harry. \"Harry, Ron, and Hermione've only just released the contents of his will.\" ",
        "Outside in the garden, over the dinner tables, the three objects Scrimgeour had given Harry, Ron, and Hermione were passed from hand to hand. Everyone exclaimed over the Deluminator and The Tales of Beedle the Bard and lamented the fact that Scrimgeour had refused to pass on The sword of Godric Gryffindor, but none of Harry, Ron, and Hermione could offer any suggestion as to why Albus Dumbledore's would have left Harry an old Snitch. As Mrs. Weasley examined the Deluminator for the third or fourth time, Mrs. Weasley Mrs. Weasley said tentatively, \" ",
        "Harry, dear, everyone's awfully hungry, we didn't like to start without \" ",
        "Harry. ... Shall I serve dinner now?\" ",
        "They all ate rather hurriedly and then, after a hasty chorus of \"Happy Birthday\" and much gulping of cake, the party broke up. Hagrid, who was invited to the wedding the following day, but was far too bulky to sleep in the overstretched Burrow, left to set up a tent for Burrow in a neighboring field. ",
        "\"Meet us upstairs,Harry Harry whispered to Hermione, while us helped Mrs. Weasley restore the garden to the garden normal state. \"After everyone's gone to bed.\" ",
        "Up in the attic room, Ron examined Ron Deluminator, and Harry filled Hagrid's mokeskin purse, not with gold, but with those items Ron most prized, apparently worthless though some of those items he most prized were: the Marauder's Map, the shard of Sirius's enchanted mirror, and R.A.B.'s locket. Ron pulled some of them were: the Marauder's Map, the shard of Sirius's enchanted mirror, and R.A.B.'s locket tight and slipped Hagrid's mokeskin purse around Ron neck, then sat holding a Snitch and watching Hagrid's mokeskin purse wings flutter feebly. At last, Hermione tapped on the back door and tiptoed inside. ",
        "\" Muffliato,\" Hermione whispered, waving Hermione wand in the direction of the stairs. ",
        "\"Thought you didn't approve of that spell?\" said Ron. ",
        "\"Times change,\" said Hermione. \"Now, show us that Deluminator.\" ",
        "Ron obliged at once. Holding her wand up in front of Ron, Ron clicked her wand. The solitary lamp they had lit went out at once. ",
        "\"The thing is,\" whispered Hermione through the dark, \"us could have achieved that with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.\" ",
        "There was a small click, and the ball of light from The solitary lamp they had lit flew back to the ceiling and illuminated them all once more. ",
        "\"Still, it's cool,\" said Ron, a little defensively. \"And from what they said, Albus Dumbledore's invented it Albus Dumbledore's!\" ",
        "\"I know, but surely Albus Dumbledore's wouldn't have singled you out in Albus Dumbledore's will just to help they turn out the lights!\" ",
        "\"D'you think Albus Dumbledore's knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and examine everything Albus Dumbledore's'd left they?\" asked Harry. ",
        "\"Definitely,\" said Hermione. \"Albus Dumbledore's couldn't tell they in his will why Albus Dumbledore's was leaving they these things, but that still doesn't explain ...\" ",
        "\"... why Albus Dumbledore's couldn't have given they a hint when Albus Dumbledore's was alive?\" asked Ron. ",
        "\"Well, exactly,\" said Hermione, now flicking through The Tales of Beedle the BardBeedle the Bard. \"If these things are important enough to pass on right under the nose of the Ministry, you'd think Albus Dumbledore's'd have let they know why ... unless Albus Dumbledore's thought it was obvious?\" ",
        "\"Thought wrong, then, didn't Albus Dumbledore's?\" said Ron. \"I always said Albus Dumbledore's was mental. Brilliant and everything, but cracked. Harry Harry an old Snitch -- what the hell was that about?\" ",
        "\"I've no idea,\" said Hermione. \"When Scrimgeour made you take Scrimgeour, Harry, I was so sure that something was going to happen!\" ",
        "\"Yeah, well,\" said Harry, Albus Dumbledore's pulse quickening as Albus Dumbledore's raised a Snitch in Albus Dumbledore's fingers. \"I wasn't going to try too hard in front of Scrimgeour, was I?\" ",
        "\"What do you mean?\" asked Hermione. ",
        "\"The a Snitch I caught in my first ever Quidditch match?\" said Harry. \"Don't you remember?\" ",
        "Hermione looked simply bemused. Ron, however, gasped, pointing frantically from Harry to a Snitch and back again until Ron found Ron voice. ",
        "\"That was the one you nearly swallowed!\" ",
        "\"Exactly,\" said Harry, and with Harry heart beating fast, Harry pressed Harry mouth to a Snitch. ",
        "his mouth did not open. Frustration and bitter disappointment welled up inside Harry: Harry lowered the golden sphere, but then Hermione cried out. ",
        "\"Writing! There's writing on it, quick, look!\" ",
        "Harry nearly dropped a Snitch a Snitch in surprise and excitement. Hermione was quite right. Engraved upon the smooth golden surface, where seconds before there had been nothing, were five words written in the thin, slanting handwriting that Harry recognized as Albus Dumbledore's's: ",
        "I open at the close. ",
        "Harry had barely read them when five words written in the thin, slanting handwriting that Harry recognized as Dumbledore's: ",
        "I open at the close vanished again. ",
        "\" 'I open at the close ...' What's that supposed to mean?\" ",
        "Hermione and Ron shook \" ",
        "Hermione and Ron heads, looking blank. ",
        "\"I open at the close ... at the close ... I open at the close ...\" ",
        "But no matter how often \" ",
        "Hermione and Ron repeated five words written in the thin, slanting handwriting that Harry recognized as Dumbledore's: ",
        "I open at the close, with many different inflections, \" ",
        "Hermione and Ron were unable to wring any more meaning from \" ",
        "Hermione and Ron. ",
        "\"And The sword of Godric Gryffindor,\" said Ron finally, when they had at last abandoned they attempts to divine meaning in a Snitch's inscription. \"Why did Ron want Harry to have The sword of Godric Gryffindor?\" ",
        "\"And why couldn't Ron just have told me?\" Harry said quietly. \"It was there, it was right there on the wall of Ron office during all our talks last year! If Ron wanted me to have it, why didn't Ron just give it to Harry then?\" ",
        "Ron felt as though Ron were sitting in an examination with a question Ron ought to have been able to answer in front of Ron, Ron brain slow and unresponsive. Was there something Ron had missed in the long talks with Albus Dumbledore's last year? Ought Ron to know what it all meant? Had Albus Dumbledore's expected Ron to understand? ",
        "\"And as for this book,\" said Hermione, \"The Tales of Beedle the Bard ... I've never even heard of Hermione, \"The Tales of Beedle the Bard!\" ",
        "\"You've never heard of The Tales of Beedle the BardBeedle the Bard?\" said Ron incredulously. \"You're kidding, right?\" ",
        "\"No, I'm not!\" said Hermione in surprise. \"Do you know Hermione, \"The Tales of Beedle the Bard, then?\" ",
        "\"Well, of course I do!\" ",
        "Harry looked up, diverted. The circumstance of Ron having read a book that Hermione had not was unprecedented. Ron, however, looked bemused by their surprise. ",
        "\"Oh come on! All the old kids' stories are supposed to be Beedle 's, aren't All the old kids' stories? The Fountain of Fair Fortune' ... The Wizard and the Hopping Pot' ... 'Babbitty Rabbitty and Babbitty Rabbitty Cackling Stump' ...\" ",
        "\"Excuse me?\" said Hermione, giggling. \"What was that last one? ",
        "\"Come off that last one!\" said Ron, looking in disbelief from HarryHermione. \"You must've heard of Babbitty Rabbitty ",
        "\"Ron, you know full well Harry and I were brought up by Muggles!\" said Hermione. \"We didn't hear stories like that when We were little, We heard 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' and 'Cinderella' -- \" ",
        "\"What's that, an illness?\" asked Ron. ",
        "\"So these are children's stories?\" asked Hermione, bending again over the runes. ",
        "\"Yeah,\" said Ron uncertainly, \"I mean, that's just what you hear, you know, that all these old stories came from Beedle. I dunno what all these old stories came from Beedle're like in the original versions.\" ",
        "\"But I wonder why Albus Dumbledore's thought I should read all these old stories came from Beedle?\" ",
        "Something creaked downstairs. ",
        "\"Probably just Charlie, now Mum's asleep, sneaking off to regrow Charlie hair,\" said Ron nervously. ",
        "\"All the same, we should get to bed,\" whispered Hermione. \"It wouldn't do to oversleep tomorrow.\" ",
        "\"No,\" agreed Ron. \"A brutal triple murder by the bridegroom's mother might put a bit of a damper on the wedding. I'll get the lights.\" ",
        "And Ron clicked his Deluminator once more as Hermione left the room. ",
        "THE the wedding ",
        "Three o'clock on the following afternoon found Harry, Ron, Fred, and George standing outside the great white marquee in the orchard, awaiting the arrival of the wedding guests. Harry had taken a large dose of Polyjuice Potion and was now the double of a redheaded Muggle boy from the local village, Ottery St. Catchpole, from whom Fred had stolen hairs using a Summoning Charm. The plan was to introduce Harry as \"Cousin Barny\" and trust to the great number of Mrs. Weasley relatives to camouflage Harry. ",
        "All four of the great number of Weasley relatives were clutching seating plans, so that the great number of Weasley relatives could help show people to the right seats. A host of white-robed waiters had arrived an hour earlier, along with a golden-jacketed band, and all of these wizards were currently sitting a short distance away under a tree; Harry could see a blue haze of pipe smoke issuing from the spot. ",
        "Behind Harry, the entrance to the marquee revealed rows and rows of fragile golden chairs set on either side of a long purple carpet. The supporting poles ",
        "were entwined with white and gold flowers. Fred and George had fastened an enormous bunch of golden balloons over the exact point where Bill and Fleur would shortly become husband and wife. Outside, butterflies and bees were hovering lazily over the grass and hedgerow. Harry was rather uncomfortable. The Muggle boy whose appearance Harry was affecting was slightly fatter than Harry, and Harry dress robes felt hot and tight in the full glare of a summer's day. ",
        "\"When I get married,\" said Fred, tugging at the collar of his dress robes, \"I won't be bothering with any of this nonsense. You can all wear what you like, and I'll put a full Body-Bind Curse on Mum until it's all over.\" ",
        "\"Mum wasn't too bad this morning, considering,\" said George. \"Cried a bit about Percy not being here, but who wants Percy? Oh blimey, brace yourselves -- here blimey, brace yourselves come, look.\" ",
        "Brightly colored figures were appearing, one by one, out of nowhere at the distant boundary of the yard. Within minutes a procession had formed, which began to snake a procession way up through the garden toward the marquee. Exotic flowers and bewitched birds fluttered on the witches' hats, while precious gems glittered from many of the wizards' cravats; a hum of excited chatter grew louder and louder, drowning the sound of the bees as the crowd approached the tent. ",
        "\"Excellent, I think I see a few veela cousins,\" said George, craning George for a better look. \"They'll need help understanding They English customs, I'll look after They. ...\" ",
        "\"Not so fast, Your Holeyness,\" said Fred, and darting past the gaggle of middle-aged witches heading a procession, Fred said, \"Here -- permettez-moi to assister ",
        "vous,\" to a pair of pretty French girls, who giggled and allowed Fred to escort permettez-moi inside. George was left to deal with the middle-aged witches and Ron took charge of Mr. Weasley's old Ministry colleague Perkins, while a rather deaf old couple fell to Harry's lot. ",
        "\"Wotcher,\" said a familiar voice as George came out of the marquee again and found Tonks and Lupin at the front of the queue. She had turned blonde for the occasion. \"Arthur told us you were the one with the curly hair. Sorry about last night,\" She added in a whisper as Harry led them up the aisle. \"the Ministry's being very anti-werewolf at the moment and us thought us presence might not do you any favors.\" ",
        "\"It's fine, I understand,\" said Harry, speaking more to Lupin than Tonks. Lupin gave Harry a swift smile, but as they turned away, Harry saw Lupin's face fall again into lines of misery. Harry did not understand it, but there was no time to dwell on the matter: Hagrid was causing a certain amount of disruption. Having misunderstood Fred's directions Harry had sat Harry, not upon the magically enlarged and reinforced seat set aside for Harry in the back row, but on five seats that now resembled a large pile of golden matchsticks. ",
        "While Mr. Weasley repaired the damage and Hagrid shouted apologies to anybody who would listen, Harry hurried back to the entrance to find Ron face-to-face with a most eccentric-looking wizard. Slightly cross- eyed, with shoulder-length white hair the texture of candyfloss, Harry wore a cap whose tassel dangled in front of Harry nose and robes of an eye-watering shade of egg-yolk yellow. An odd symbol, rather like a triangular eye, glistened from a golden chain around Harry neck. ",
        "\"Xenophilius Lovegood,\" Harry said, extending a hand to Harry, \"my daughter and I live just over the hill, so kind of the good Weasleys to invite us. But I think you know my Luna?\" Harry added to Ron. ",
        "\"Yes,\" said Ron. \"Isn't my Luna with you?\" ",
        "\"my Luna lingered in that charming little garden to say hello to the gnomes, such a glorious infestation! How few wizards realize just how much we can learn from the wise little gnomes -- or, to give How few wizards How few wizards correct name, the Gernumbli gardensi.\" ",
        "\"Ours do know a lot of excellent swear words,\" said Ron, \"but I think Fred and George taught Fred and George those.\" ",
        "Ron led a party of warlocks into the marquee as my Luna rushed up. ",
        "\"Hello, Harry!\" she said. ",
        "\"Er -- my name's Barny,\" said Harry, flummoxed. ",
        "\"Oh, have you changed that too?\" she asked brightly. ",
        "\"How did you know -- ?\" ",
        "\"Oh, just your expression,\" she said. ",
        "Like she father, my Luna was wearing bright yellow robes, which she had accessorized with a large sunflower in she hair. Once you got over the brightness of it all, the general effect was quite pleasant. At least there were no radishes dangling from she ears. ",
        "Xenophilius, who was deep in conversation with an acquaintance, had missed the exchange between ",
        "Luna and Harry. Bidding the wizard farewell, he turned to he daughter, who held up her finger and said, \"Daddy, look -- one of the gnomes actually bit me!\" ",
        "\"How wonderful! Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial!\" said Mr. Lovegood, seizing my Luna's outstretched finger and examining the bleeding puncture marks. \"Luna, my love, if you should feel any burgeoning talent today -- perhaps an unexpected urge to sing opera or to declaim in Mermish -- do not repress it! You may have been gifted by the Gernumblies!\" ",
        "Ron, passing them in the opposite direction, let out a loud snort. ",
        "Ron Ron can laugh,\" said my Luna serenely as Harry led my Luna and Xenophilius toward their seats, \"but her father has done a lot of research on Gernumbli magic.\" ",
        "\"Really?\" said Harry, who had long since decided not to challenge Luna or her father's peculiar views. \"Are you sure you don't want to put anything on that bite, though?\" ",
        "\"Oh, it's fine,\" said my Luna, sucking her finger in a dreamy fashion and looking Harry up and down. \"You look smart. I told Daddy most people would probably wear dress robes, but Daddy believes you ought to wear sun colors to a wedding, for luck, you know.\" ",
        "As she drifted off after she , Ron reappeared with an elderly witch clutching Ron arm. she beaky nose, red-rimmed eyes, and feathery pink hat gave she the look of a bad-tempered flamingo. ",
        "\"... and your hair's much too long, Ronald, for a moment I thought you were Ginevra. Merlin's beard, ",
        "what is Xenophilius Lovegood wearing? Merlin's beard, ",
        "what is Xenophilius Lovegood wearing looks like an omelet. And who are you?\" she barked at Harry. ",
        "\"Oh yeah, Auntie Muriel, this is our cousin Barny.\" ",
        "\"Another Weasley? You breed like gnomes. Isn't Harry Potter here? I was hoping to meet Harry Potter. I thought Harry Potter was a friend of yours, Ronald, or have you merely been boasting?\" ",
        "\"No -- Harry Potter couldn't come -- \" ",
        "\"Hmm. Made an excuse, did Harry Potter? Not as gormless as Harry Potter looks in press photographs, then. I've just been instructing the bride on how best to wear my tiara,\" the bride shouted at Harry. \"Goblin-made, you know, and been in my family for centuries. the bride's a good-looking girl, but still -- French. Well, well, find me a good seat, Ronald, I am a hundred and seven and I ought not to be on my feet too long.\" ",
        "Ron gave Harry a meaningful look as Ron passed and did not reappear for some time: When next they met at the entrance, Harry had shown a dozen more people to a dozen more people places. The marquee was nearly full now, and for the first time there was no queue outside. ",
        "\"Nightmare, Auntie Muriel is,\" said Ron, mopping Ron forehead on Ron sleeve. \"Auntie Muriel used to come for Christmas every year, then, thank God, Auntie Muriel took offense because Fred and George set off a Dung-bomb under Auntie Muriel chair at dinner. Dad always says Auntie Muriel'll have written Fred and George set off a Dung-bomb under her chair at dinner out of Auntie Muriel will -- like Fred and George set off a Dung-bomb under her chair at dinner care, Fred and George set off a Dung-bomb under her chair at dinner're going to end up richer than anyone in my family, rate Fred and George set off a Dung-bomb under her chair at dinner're going. ... Wow,\" he added, blinking rather rapidly as Hermione came hurrying toward them. \"You look great!\" ",
        "\"Always the tone of surprise,\" said Hermione, though Hermione smiled. Hermione was wearing a floaty, lilac-colored dress with matching high heels; Hermione hair was sleek and shiny. \"Auntie Muriel doesn't agree, I just met Auntie Muriel upstairs while Auntie Muriel was giving Fleur the tiara. Auntie Muriel said, 'Oh dear, is this the Muggle-born?' and then, 'Bad posture and skinny ankles.' \" ",
        "\"Don't take it personally, Auntie Muriel's rude to everyone,\" said Ron. ",
        "\"Talking about Auntie Muriel?\" inquired George, reemerging from the marquee with Fred. \"Yeah, Auntie Muriel's just told me my ears are lopsided. Old bat. I wish old Uncle Bilius was still with us, though; old Uncle Bilius was a right laugh at weddings.\" ",
        "\"Wasn't old Uncle Bilius the one who saw a Grim and died twenty- four hours later?\" asked Hermione. ",
        "\"Well, yeah, old Uncle Bilius went a bit odd toward the end,\" conceded George. ",
        "\"But before old Uncle Bilius went loopy old Uncle Bilius was the life and soul of the party,\" said Fred. \"old Uncle Bilius used to down an entire bottle of firewhisky, then run onto the dance floor, hoist up old Uncle Bilius robes, and start pulling bunches of flowers out of old Uncle Bilius -- \" ",
        "\"Yes, old Uncle Bilius sounds a real charmer,\" said Hermione, while Harry roared with laughter. ",
        "\"Never married, for some reason,\" said Ron. ",
        "\"You amaze me,\" said Hermione. ",
        "They were all laughing so much that none of They noticed the latecomer, a dark-haired young man with a large, curved nose and thick black eyebrows, until ",
        "old Uncle Bilius held out old Uncle Bilius invitation to Ron and said, with Ron eyes on Hermione, \"You look vunderful.\" ",
        "\"Viktor!\" she shrieked, and dropped she small beaded bag, which made a loud thump quite disproportionate to its size. As she scrambled, blushing, to pick it up, she said, \"I didn't know you were -- goodness -- it's lovely to see -- how are you?\" ",
        "Ron's ears had turned bright red again. After glancing at Krum's invitation as if \" ",
        "Ron did not believe a word of it, \" ",
        "Ron said, much too loudly, \"How come you're here?\" ",
        "\"Fleur invited me,\" said Krum, eyebrows raised. ",
        "Harry, who had no grudge against Krum, shook hands; then, feeling that it would be prudent to remove Krum from Ron's vicinity, offered to show Krum Krum seat. ",
        "\"Your friend is not pleased to see me,\" said Krum as Krum entered the now packed marquee. \"Or is Krum a relative?\" Krum added with a glance at Harry's red curly hair. ",
        "\"Cousin,Harry Harry muttered, but Krum was not really listening. Harry appearance was causing a stir, particularly amongst the veela cousins: Harry was, after all, a famous Quidditch player. While people were still craning people necks to get a good look at Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George came hurrying down the aisle. ",
        "\"Time to sit down,\" Fred told Harry, \"or we're going to get run over by the bride.\" ",
        "Harry, Ron, and Hermione took \" ",
        "Harry, Ron, and Hermione seats in the second row behind Fred and George. Hermione looked rather pink and Ron's ears were still scarlet. After a ",
        "few moments Ron muttered to Harry, \"Did you see Ron's grown a stupid little beard?\" ",
        "Harry gave a noncommittal grunt. ",
        "A sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm tent, the general murmuring broken by occasional spurts of excited laughter. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley strolled up the aisle, smiling and waving at relatives; \"Another Weasley was wearing a brand-new set of amethyst-colored robes with a matching hat. ",
        "A moment later Bill and Charlie stood up at the front of the marquee, both wearing dress robes, with large white roses in both wearing dress robes buttonholes; Fred wolf-whistled and there was an outbreak of giggling from the veela cousins. Then the crowd fell silent as music swelled from what seemed to be the golden balloons. ",
        "\"Ooooh!\" said Hermione, swiveling around in her seat to look at the entrance. ",
        "A great collective sigh issued from the assembled witches and wizards as Monsieur Delacour and Fleur came walking up the aisle, Fleur gliding, Monsieur Delacour bouncing and beaming. Fleur was wearing a very simple white dress and seemed to be emitting a strong, silvery glow. While Fleur radiance usually dimmed everyone else by comparison, today it beautified everybody it fell upon. Ginny and Gabrielle, both wearing golden dresses, looked even prettier than usual, and once Fleur had reached Fleur, Bill did not look as though Fleur had ever met Fenrir Greyback. ",
        "\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" said a slightly singsong voice, and with a slight shock, Harry saw the same small, tufty-haired wizard who had presided at Dumbledore's funeral, now standing in front of Billand Fleur. \"We are gathered here today to celebrate the union of two faithful souls ...\" ",
        "\"Yes, my tiara sets off the whole thing nicely,\" said Auntie Muriel in a rather carrying whisper. \"But I must say, Ginevra's dress is far too low cut.\" ",
        "Ginny glanced around, grinning, winked at Harry, then quickly faced the front again. Harry's mind wandered a long way from the marquee, back to afternoons spent alone with Ginny in lonely parts of the school grounds. They seemed so long ago; They had always seemed too good to be true, as though he had been stealing shining hours from a normal person's life, a person without a lightning-shaped scar on he forehead. ... ",
        "\"Do you, William Arthur, take Fleur Isabelle ... ?\" ",
        "In the front row, Mrs. Weasley and Madame Delacour were both sobbing quietly into scraps of lace. Trumpetlike sounds from the back of the marquee told everyone that Hagrid had taken out one of Hagrid own tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs. Hermione turned and beamed at Harry; Hermione eyes too were full of tears. ",
        "\"... then I declare you bonded for life.\" ",
        "The tufty-haired wizard waved The tufty-haired wizard wand high over the heads of Bill and Fleur and a shower of silver stars fell upon high over the heads of Bill and Fleur and a shower of silver stars, spiraling around high over the heads of Bill and Fleur and a shower of silver stars now entwined figures. As Fred and George led a round of applause, the golden balloons overhead burst: Birds of paradise and tiny golden bells flew and floated out of Birds of paradise and tiny golden bells, adding Birds of paradise and tiny golden bells songs and chimes to the din.

        "\"Ladies and gentlemen!\" called The tufty-haired wizard. \"If you would please stand up!\" ",
        "They all did so, Auntie Muriel Auntie Muriel grumbling audibly; Auntie Muriel waved Auntie Muriel wand again. The seats on which They all had been sitting rose gracefully into the air as the canvas walls of the marquee vanished, so that They all stood beneath a canopy supported by golden poles, with a glorious view of the sunlit orchard and surrounding countryside. Next, a pool of molten gold spread from the center of the tent to form a gleaming dance floor; the hovering chairs grouped Next, a pool of molten gold spread from the center of the tent to form a gleaming dance floor around small, white-clothed tables, which all floated gracefully back to earth around it, and the golden- jacketed band trooped toward a podium. ",
        "\"Smooth,\" said Ron approvingly as the waiters popped up on all sides, some bearing silver trays of pumpkin juice, butterbeer, and firewhisky, others tottering piles of tarts and sandwiches. ",
        "\"We should go and congratulate them!\" said Hermione, standing on tiptoe to see the place where Bill and Fleur had vanished amid a crowd of well- wishers. ",
        "\"Well have time later,\" shrugged Ron, snatching three butter-beers from a passing tray and handing one to Harry. \"Hermione, cop hold, let's grab a table. ... Not there! Nowhere near Auntie Muriel -- \" ",
        "Ron led the way across the empty dance floor, glancing left and right as Ron went: Harry felt sure that Harry was keeping an eye out for Krum. By the time they had reached the other side of the marquee, most of the tables were occupied: The emptiest was the one where Luna sat alone. ",
        "\"All right if we join you?\" asked Ron. ",
        "\"Oh yes,\" Luna said happily. \"Daddy's just gone to give Bill and Fleur our present.\" ",
        "\"What is it, a lifetime's supply of Gurdyroots?\" asked Ron. ",
        "Hermione aimed a kick at Ron under a table, but caught Harry instead. Eyes watering in pain, Harry lost track of the conversation for a few moments. ",
        "The band had begun to play. Bill and Fleur took to the dance floor first, to great applause; after a while, \"Another Weasley led Madame Delacour onto the dance floor, followed by Mrs. Weasley and Fleur's father. ",
        "\"I like this song,\" said Luna, swaying in time to the waltzlike tune, and a few seconds later Luna stood up and glided onto the dance floor, where Luna revolved on the spot, quite alone, eyes closed and waving Luna arms. ",
        "\"Luna's great, isn't Luna?\" said Ron admiringly. \"Always good value.\" ",
        "But the smile vanished from Ron face at once: Krum had dropped into Luna's vacant seat. Hermione looked pleasurably flustered, but this time Krum had not come to compliment Luna. With a scowl on his face Krum said, \"Who is that man in the yellow?\" ",
        "\"That's Xenophilius Lovegood, he's the father of a friend of ours,\" said Ron. Ron pugnacious tone indicated that they were not about to laugh at Xenophilius, despite the clear provocation. \"Come and dance,\" Ron added abruptly to Hermione. ",
        "Hermione looked taken aback, but pleased too, and got up. they vanished together into the growing throng on the dance floor. ",
        "\"Ah, they are together now?\" asked Krum, momentarily distracted. ",
        "\"Er -- sort of,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"Who are you?\" Krum asked. ",
        "\"Barny Weasley.\" ",
        "they shook hands. ",
        "\"You, Barny -- you know that man in the yellow?\" ",
        "\"No, I only met that man in the yellow today. Why?\" ",
        "Krum glowered over the top of that man in the yellow drink, watching Xenophilius, who was chatting to several warlocks on the other side of the dance floor. ",
        "\"Because,\" said Krum, \"if that man in the yellow vos not a guest of Fleur's, I vould duel that man in the yellow, here and now, for vearing that filthy sign upon that man in the yellow chest.\" ",
        "\"Sign?\" said Harry, looking over at Xenophilius too. The strange triangular eye was gleaming on his chest. \"Why? What's wrong with it?\" ",
        "\"Grindelvald. That is Grindelvald's sign.\" ",
        "\"Grindelwald . . . Dumbledore defeated?\" ",
        "\"Exactly.\" ",
        "Krum's jaw muscles worked as if Dumbledore were chewing, then Dumbledore said, \" ",
        "\"Grindelvald killed many people, my grandfather, for instance.

        "\"Grindelvald taught family members better.\" ",
        "Krum cracked \" ",
        "Krum knuckles menacingly and glowered at Xenophilius. Harry felt perplexed. It seemed incredibly unlikely that Luna's father was a supporter of the Dark Arts, and nobody else in the tent seemed to have recognized the triangular, runelike shape. ",
        "\"Are you -- er -- quite sure it's Grindelwald's -- ?\" ",
        "\"I am not mistaken,\" said \" ",
        "Krum coldly. \"I valked past that sign for several years, I know that sign veil.\" ",
        "\"Well, there's a chance,\" said Harry, \"that Xenophilius doesn't actually know what the symbol means. The Lovegoods are quite ... unusual. The Lovegoods could easily have picked The Lovegoods up somewhere and think The Lovegoods's a cross section of the head of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack or something.\" ",
        "\"The cross section of a vot?\" ",
        "\"Well, I don't know what they are, but apparently The Lovegoods and The Lovegoods daughter go on holiday looking for they. ...\" ",
        "Harry felt Harry was doing a bad job explaining Luna and his daughter . ",
        "\"That's his daughter,\" Harry said, pointing at Luna, who was still dancing alone, waving his daughter around his daughter head like someone attempting to beat off midges. ",
        "\"Vy is his daughter doing that?\" asked Krum. ",
        "\"Probably trying to get rid of a Wrackspurt,\" said Harry, who recognized the symptoms. ",
        "Krum did not seem to know whether or not Harry was making fun of Harry. Harry drew his wand from inside Harry robes and tapped his wand menacingly on Harry thigh; sparks flew out of the end. ",
        "\"Gregorovitch!\" said Harry loudly, and Krum started, but Harry was too excited to care; the memory had come back to Harry at the sight of Krum's wand: Ollivander taking Ollivander and examining Ollivander carefully before the Triwizard Tournament. ",
        "\"Vot about Harry?\" asked Krum suspiciously. ",
        "\"Harry's a wandmaker!\" ",
        "\"I know that,\" said Krum. ",
        "\"Harry made his wand! That's why I thought -- Quidditch -- \" ",
        "Krum was looking more and more suspicious. ",
        "\"How do you know Gregorovitch made my vand?\" ",
        "\"I ... I read my vand somewhere, I think,\" said Harry. \"In a -- a fan magazine,\" Harry improvised wildly and Krum looked mollified. ",
        "\"I had not realized I ever discussed my vand with fans,\" Harry said. ",
        "\"So ... er ... where is Gregorovitch these days?\" ",
        "Krum looked puzzled. ",
        "\"Harry retired several years ago. I vos one of the last to purchase a Gregorovitch vand. They are the best -- although I know, of course, that you Britons set much store by Ollivander.\" ",
        "Harry did not answer. Harry pretended to watch the dancers, like Krum, but Harry was thinking hard. So Voldemort was looking for a celebrated wandmaker, and Harry did not have to search far for a reason: It was surely because of what Harry's wand had done on the night that Voldemort had pursued Harry across the skies. The holly and phoenix feather wand had conquered the borrowed wand, something that Ollivander had not anticipated or understood. Would Gregorovitch know better? Was Harry truly more skilled than Ollivander, did Harry know secrets of wands that Ollivander did not? ",
        "\"This girl is very nice-looking,\" Krum said, recalling Harry to Krum surroundings. Krum was pointing at Ginny, who had just joined Luna. \"This girl is also a relative of yours?\" ",
        "\"Yeah,\" said Harry, suddenly irritated, \"and This girl's seeing someone. Jealous type. Big bloke. You wouldn't want to cross someone.\" ",
        "Krum grunted. ",
        "\"Vot,\" someone said, draining someone goblet and getting to someone feet again, \"is the point of being an international Quidditch player if all the good-looking girls are taken?\" ",
        "And someone strode off, leaving Harry to take a sandwich from a passing waiter and make someone way around the edge of the crowded dance floor. someone wanted to find Ron, to tell Ron about Gregorovitch, but Ron was dancing with Hermione out in the middle of the dance floor.  ",
        "Harry leaned up against one of the golden pillars and watched Ginny, who was now dancing with Fred and George's friend Lee Jordan, trying not to feel resentful about the promise Harry had given Ron. ",
        "Harry had never been to a wedding before, so Harry could not judge how Wizarding celebrations differed from Muggle ones, though Harry was pretty sure that the latter would not involve a wedding cake topped with two model phoenixes that took flight when the cake was cut, or bottles of champagne that floated unsupported through the crowd. As evening drew in, and moths began to swoop under the canopy, now lit with floating golden lanterns, the revelry became more and more uncontained. Fred and George had long since disappeared into the darkness with a pair of Fleur's cousins; Charlie, Hagrid, and a squat wizard in a purple porkpie hat were singing \"Odo the Hero\" in a corner. ",
        "Wandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of Ron's who seemed unsure whether or not Harry was Harry son, Harry spotted an old wizard sitting alone at a table. Harry cloud of white hair made Harry look rather like an aged dandelion clock and was topped by a moth-eaten fez. Harry was vaguely familiar: Racking Harry brains, Harry suddenly realized that this was Elphias Doge, member of the Order of the Phoenix and the writer of Dumbledore's obituary. ",
        "Harry approached Harry. ",
        "\"May I sit down?\" ",
        "\"Of course, of course,\" said Doge; Doge had a rather high-pitched, wheezy voice. ",

        "Doge gasped. ",
        "\"My dear boy! Arthur told me you were here, disguised. ... I am so glad, so honored!\" ",
        "In a flutter of Doge poured Harry a goblet of champagne. ",
        "\"I thought of writing to you,\" Arthur whispered, \"after Dumbledore ... the shock ... and for you, I am sure ",
        "Doge's tiny eyes filled with sudden tears. ",
        "\"I saw the obituary you wrote for the Daily Prophet,\" said Harry. \"I didn't realize you knew Dumbledore Dumbledore so well.\" ",
        "\"As well as anyone,\" said Doge, dabbing Doge's tiny eyes with a napkin. \"Certainly I knew Doge longest, if you don't count Aberforth -- and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth.\" ",
        "\"Speaking of the Daily Prophet ... I don't know whether you saw, Mr. Doge -- ?\" ",
        "\"Oh, please call me Elphias, dear boy.\" ",
        "\"Elphias, I don't know whether you saw the interview Rita Skeeter gave about Dumbledore?\" ",
        "Doge's face flooded with angry color. ",
        "\"Oh yes, Harry, I saw it. That woman, or vulture might be a more accurate term, positively pestered me to talk to Harry. I am ashamed to say that I became rather rude, called Harry an interfering trout, which ",

        "\"Well, in that interview,\" Harry went on, Rita Skeeter Rita Skeeter hinted that Dumbledore Dumbledore was involved in the Dark Arts when Dumbledore was young.\" ",
        "\"Don't believe a word of it!\" said Doge at once. \"Not a word, Harry! Let nothing tarnish your memories of Dumbledore!\" ",
        "Harry looked into Doge's earnest, pained face and felt, not reassured, but frustrated. Did Doge really think it was that easy, that Harry could simply choose not to believe? Didn't Doge understand Harry's need to be sure, to know everything? ",
        "Doge Doge suspected Harry's feelings, for Doge looked concerned and hurried on, HarryHarry, Rita Skeeter is a dreadful -- \" ",
        "But Doge was interrupted by a shrill cackle. ",
        "Rita SkeeterRita Skeeter? Oh, I love Rita Skeeter, always read Rita Skeeter!\" ",
        "Harry and Doge looked up to see Auntie Muriel standing there, the plumes dancing on Auntie Muriel hat, a goblet of champagne in Auntie Muriel hand. \"Auntie Muriel's written a book about Dumbledore, you know!\" ",
        "\"Hello, Auntie Muriel,\" said Doge. \"Yes, we were just discussing -- \" ",
        "\"You there! Give me your chair, I'm a hundred and seven!\" ",
        "Another redheaded Weasley cousin jumped off Another redheaded Weasley cousin seat, looking alarmed, and Auntie Muriel Auntie Muriel swung it ",
        "around with surprising strength and plopped Auntie Muriel down upon it between Doge. ",
        "\"Hello again, Barry, or whatever your name is,\" Auntie Muriel said to Harry. \"Now, what were you saying about Rita Skeeter, Elphias? You know Auntie Muriel's written a biography of Dumbledore? I can't wait to read a biography of Dumbledore, I must remember to place an order at Flourish and Blotts!\" ",
        "Doge looked stiff and solemn at this, but Auntie Muriel drained Auntie Muriel goblet and clicked Auntie Muriel bony fingers at a passing waiter for a replacement. Auntie Muriel took another large gulp of champagne, belched, and then said, \"There's no need to look like a pair of stuffed frogs! Before he became so respected and respectable and all that tosh, there were some mighty funny rumors about Albus!\" ",
        "\"Ill-informed sniping,\" said Doge, turning radish- colored again. ",
        "\"You would say that, Elphias,\" cackled Auntie Muriel. \"I noticed how you skated over the sticky patches in that obituary of yours!\" ",
        "\"I'm sorry you think so,\" said Doge, more coldly still. ",
        "\"I assure you I was writing from the heart.\" ",
        "\"Oh, we all know you worshipped Dumbledore; I daresay you'll still think Dumbledore was a saint even if a saint does turn out that Dumbledore did away with Dumbledore Squib sister!\" ",
        "\"Muriell\" exclaimed Doge. ",
        "A chill that had nothing to do with the iced champagne was stealing through Harry's chest. ",
        "\"What do you mean?\" Dumbledore asked Auntie Muriel. \"Who said his Squib sister was a Squib? I thought his Squib sister was ill?\" ",
        "\"Thought wrong, then, didn't you, Barry!\" said Auntie Muriel, looking delighted at the effect Auntie Muriel had produced. \"Anyway, how could you expect to know anything about it? It all happened years and years before you were even thought of, my dear, and the truth is that those of us who were alive then never knew what really happened. That's why I can't wait to find out what Rita Skeeter's unearthed! Dumbledore kept that sister of Dumbledore quiet for a long time!\" ",
        "\"Untrue!\" wheezed Doge. \"Absolutely untrue!\" ",
        "\"Dumbledore never told me his Squib sister was a Squib,\" said Harry, without thinking, still cold inside. ",
        "\"And why on earth would Dumbledore tell you?\" screeched Auntie Muriel, swaying a little in his seat as Auntie Muriel attempted to focus upon Harry. ",
        "\"The reason Albus never spoke about Ariana,\" began Elphias in a voice stiff with emotion, \"is, I should have thought, quite clear. He was so devastated by Auntie Muriel death -- \" ",
        "\"Why did nobody ever see Auntie Muriel, Elphias?\" squawked Auntie Muriel. \"Why did half of us never even know Auntie Muriel existed, until half of us carried the coffin out of the house and held a funeral for Auntie Muriel? Where was saintly Albus while Ariana was locked in the cellar? Off being brilliant at Hogwarts, and never mind what was going on in the house!\" ",
        "\"What d'you mean, locked in the cellar?\" asked Harry. \"What is this?Doge looked wretched. Auntie Muriel cackled again and answered Harry. ",
        "\"Dumbledore's mother was a terrifying woman, simply terrifying. Muggle-born, though I heard \"Dumbledore's mother pretended otherwise -- \" ",
        "\"\"Dumbledore's mother never pretended anything of the sort! Kendra was a fine woman,\" whispered Doge miserably, but Auntie Muriel Auntie Muriel ignored Doge. ",

        "\"Ariana was not a Squib!\" wheezed Doge. ",
        "\"So you say, Elphias, but explain, then, why Auntie Muriel never attended Hogwarts!\" said Auntie Muriel. Auntie Muriel turned back to Harry. \"In our day, Squibs were often hushed up, though to take it to the extreme of actually imprisoning a little girl in the house and pretending Auntie Muriel didn't exist -- \" ",
        "\"I tell you, that's not what happened!\" said Doge, but Auntie Muriel Auntie Muriel steamrollered on, still addressing Harry. ",
        "\"Squibs were usually shipped off to Muggle schools and encouraged to integrate into the Muggle community . . . much kinder than trying to find them a place in the Wizarding world, where them must always be second class; but naturally Dumbledore wouldn't have dreamed of letting Dumbledore daughter go to a Muggle school -- \" ",

        "\"Ariana to leave the house?\" cackled Auntie Muriel. \"And yet \" ",
        "\"Ariana was never taken to St. Mungo's and no Healer was ever summoned to see \" ",
        "\"Ariana!\" ",
        "\"Really, Auntie Muriel, how you can possibly know whether ",

        "\"Ariana had never been seen there. All most suspicious, Lancelot thought!\" ",
        "Doge looked to be on the verge of tears. Auntie Muriel, who seemed to be enjoying Doge hugely, snapped Doge fingers for more champagne. Numbly Harry thought of how the Dursleys had once shut Numbly Harry up, locked Numbly Harry away, kept Numbly Harry out of sight, all for the crime of being a wizard. Had Dumbledore's sister suffered the same fate in reverse: imprisoned for Dumbledore's sister lack of magic? And had Dumbledore truly left Dumbledore's sister to Dumbledore's sister fate while Dumbledore went off to Hogwarts, to prove Dumbledore brilliant and talented? ",
        "\"Now, if Kendra hadn't died first,\" Auntie Muriel resumed, ",
        "\"I'd have said that it was Kendra who finished off \" ",
        "\"Ariana\"How can you, Auntie Muriel?\" groaned Doge. \"A mother kill A mother own daughter? Think what you are saying!\" ",
        "\"If A mother was capable of imprisoning her own daughter for years on end, why not?\" shrugged Auntie Muriel. \"But as I say, it doesn't fit, because Kendra died before \" ",
        "\"Ariana -- of what, nobody ever seemed sure -- \" ",
        "\"Oh, no doubt \" ",
        "\"Ariana murdered \" ",
        "\"Ariana,\" said Doge with a brave attempt at scorn. \"Why not?\" ",
        "\"Yes, \" ",
        "\"Ariana might have made a desperate bid for freedom and killed Kendra in the struggle,\" said Auntie Muriel thoughtfully. \"Shake your head all you ",
        "like, Elphias! You were at \" ",
        "\"Ariana's funeral, were you not?\" ",
        "\"Yes I was,\" said Doge, through trembling lips. \"And a more desperately sad occasion I cannot remember. Albus was heartbroken -- \" ",
        "\"Albus heart wasn't the only thing. Didn't Aberforth break Albus 's nose halfway through the service?\" ",
        "If Doge had looked horrified before this, it was nothing to how Doge looked now. Auntie Muriel might have stabbed Doge. Auntie Muriel cackled loudly and took another swig of champagne, which dribbled down Auntie Muriel chin. ",
        "\"How do you -- ?\" croaked Doge. ",
        "\"A mother was friendly with old Bathilda Bagshot,\" said Auntie Muriel happily. \"Bathilda described the whole thing to A mother while I was listening at the door. A coffin-side brawl! The way Bathilda told Bathilda, Aberforth shouted that it was all Albus 's fault that \" ",
        "\"Ariana was dead and then punched Doge in the face. According to Bathilda, Albus did not even defend Albus, and that's odd enough in Bathilda, Albus could have destroyed Aberforth in a duel with both hands tied behind Albus back.\" ",

        "The name was printed on the front of one of Harry's textbooks, though admittedly not one of the ones he had read most attentively. ",
        "\"Yes,\" said Doge, clutching at Harry's question like a drowning man at a life belt. \"A most gifted magical historian and an old friend of Albus's.\" ",
        "\"Quite gaga these days, I've heard,\" said \" ",
        "Muriel \" ",

Ron, a few seconds late in realizing what was going on, lunged across the table, pushing Hermione sideways onto The waitress bench. ",
        "The force of the Death Eaters' spells shattered the tiled wall where Ron's head had just been, as Harry, still invisible, yelled, \"Stupefyl\" ",
        "The great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light: The great blond Death Eater slumped sideways, unconscious. The great blond Death Eater companion, unable to see who had cast the spell, fired another at Ron: Shining black ropes flew from The great blond Death Eater wand-tip and bound Ron's head to foot -- The waitress screamed and ran for the door -- Harry sent another Stunning Spell at The great blond Death Eater with the twisted face who had tied up Ron, but another Stunning Spell missed, rebounded on the window, and hit the waitress, who collapsed in front of the door. ",
        "\"Expulsol\" bellowed The great blond Death Eater, and the table behind which Harry was standing blew up: The force of the Death Eaters' spells slammed Harry into the wall and Harry felt Harry wand leave Harry hand as the Invisibility Cloak slipped off Harry. ",
        "\"Petrificus TotalusV' screamed Hermione from out of sight, and The great blond Death Eater fell forward like a statue to land with a crunching thud on the mess of broken china, table, and coffee. Hermione crawled out from ",
        "underneath the bench, shaking bits of glass ashtray out of Hermione hair and trembling all over. ",
        "\"D-diffindo,\" Hermione said, pointing his wand at Ron, who roared in pain as Hermione slashed open the knee of Harry jeans, leaving a deep cut. \"Oh, I'm so sorry, Ron, his hand's shaking! Diffindol\" ",
        "The severed ropes fell away. Ron got to Ron feet, shaking Ron arms to regain feeling in them. Harry picked up his wand and climbed over all the debris to where The great blond Death Eater was sprawled across the bench. ",
        "\"I should've recognized Harry, Harry was there the night Dumbledore died,\" Harry said. Harry turned over The great blond Death Eater with Harry foot; the man's eyes moved rapidly between Harry, Ron, and Hermione. ",
        "\"That's Dolohov,\" said Ron. \"I recognize Harry from the old wanted posters. I think the big one's Thorfinn Rowle.\" ",
        "\"Never mind what they're called!\" said Hermione a little hysterically. \"How did they find they? What are they going to do?\" ",
        "Somehow Hermione panic seemed to clear Harry's head. ",
        "\"Lock the door,\" Harry told Hermione, \"and Ron, turn out the lights.\" ",
        "Harry looked down at the paralyzed Dolohov, thinking fast as the lock clicked and Ron used the Deluminator to plunge the cafe into darkness. Harry could hear the men who had jeered at Hermione earlier, yelling at another girl in the distance. ",
        "\"What are we going to do with the men who had jeered at Hermione earlier?\" Ron whispered to Harry through the dark; then, even more quietly, \"Kill the men who had jeered at Hermione earlier? the men who had jeered at Hermione earlier'd kill we. the men who had jeered at Hermione earlier had a good go just now.\" ",
        "Hermione shuddered and took a step backward. Harry shook his head. ",
        "\"we just need to wipe the men who had jeered at Hermione earlier memories,\" said Harry. \"It's better like that, it'll throw the men who had jeered at Hermione earlier off the scent. If we killed the men who had jeered at Hermione earlier it'd be obvious we were here.\" ",
        "\"You're the boss,\" said Ron, sounding profoundly relieved. \"But I've never done a Memory Charm.\" ",
        "\"Nor have I,\" said Hermione, \"but I know the theory.\" ",
        "She took a deep, calming breath, then pointed She at Dolohov's forehead and said, \"Obliviate.\" ",
        "At once, Dolohov's eyes became unfocused and dreamy. ",
        "\"Brilliant!\" said Harry, clapping She on the back. \"Take care of the other one and the waitress while Ron and I clear up.\" ",
        "\"Clear up?\" said Ron, looking around at the partly destroyed cafe. \"Why?\" ",
        "\"Don't you think Ron and I might wonder what's happened if Ron and I wake up and find Ron and I in a place that looks like it's just been bombed?\" ",
        "\"Oh right, yeah ...\" ",
        "Ron struggled for a moment before managing to extract his wand from Ron pocket. ",
        "\"It's no wonder I can't get It out, Hermione, you packed my old jeans, my old jeans're tight.\" ",
        "\"Oh, I'm so sorry,\" hissed Hermione, and as she dragged The waitress out of sight of the windows, Harry heard she mutter a suggestion as to where Ron could stick his wand instead. ",
        "Once the partly destroyed cafe was restored to the partly destroyed cafe previous condition, they heaved the Death Eaters back into they booth and propped their booth up facing each other. ",
        "\"But how did they find they?\" Hermione asked, looking from one inert man to the other. \"How did they know where they were?\" ",
        "she turned to Harry. ",
        "\"You -- you don't think you've still got your Trace on she, do you, Harry?\" ",
        "\"Harry can't have,\" said Ron. \"The Trace breaks at seventeen, that's Wizarding law, you can't put Wizarding law on an adult.\" ",
        "\"As far as you know,\" said Hermione. \"What if the Death Eaters have found a way to put the Death Eaters on a seventeen-year-old?\" ",
        "\"But Harry hasn't been near a Death Eater in the last twenty-four hours. Who's supposed to have put a Trace back on Harry?\" ",
        "Hermione did not reply. Harry felt contaminated, tainted: Was that really how the Death Eaters had found the Death Eaters? ",
        "\"If I can't use magic, and you can't use magic near me, without they giving away they position -- \" Harry began. ",
        "\"they're not splitting up!\" said Hermione firmly. ",
        "\"they need a safe place to hide,\" said Ron. \"Give they time to think things through.\" ",
        "\"Grimmauld Place,\" said Harry. ",
        "The other two gaped. ",
        "\"Don't be silly, Harry, Snape can get in there!\" ",
        "\"Ron's dad said \"Ron's dad've put up jinxes against \"Ron's dad -- and even if \"Ron's dad haven't worked,\" \"Ron's dad pressed on as Hermione began to argue, \"so what? I swear, I'd like nothing better than to meet Snape!\" ",
        "\"But -- \" ",
        "\"Hermione, where else is there? It's the best chance they've got. Snape's only one Death Eater. If I've still got a Trace on me, they'll have whole crowds of a Trace on they wherever else they go.\" ",
        "She could not argue, though She looked as if She would have liked to. While She unlocked the cafe door, Ron clicked the Deluminator to release the cafe's light. Then, on Harry's count of three, they reversed the spells upon they three victims, and before the waitress or either of the Death Eaters could do more than stir sleepily, Harry, Ron, and Hermione had turned on the spot and vanished into the compressing darkness once more. ",
        "Seconds later Harry's lungs expanded gratefully and Harry opened Harry eyes: They were now standing in the middle of a familiar small and shabby square. Tall, dilapidated houses looked down on They from every side. Number twelve was visible to They, for They had been told of Number twelve existence by Dumbledore, Number twelve Secret-  ",
        "Keeper, and They rushed toward Number twelve, checking every few yards that They were not being followed or observed. They raced up the stone steps, and Harry tapped the front door once with his wand. They heard a series of metallic clicks and the clatter of a chain, then the front door swung open with a creak and They hurried over the threshold. ",
        "As Harry closed the door behind They, the old- fashioned gas lamps sprang into life, casting flickering light along the length of the hallway. It looked just as Harry remembered it: eerie, cobwebbed, the outlines of the house-elf heads on the wall throwing odd shadows up the staircase. Long dark curtains concealed the portrait of Sirius's mother. The only thing that was out of place was the troll's leg umbrella stand, which was lying on The only thing that was out of place side as if Tonks had just knocked its side over again. ",
        "\"I think somebody's been in here,\" ",
        "Hermione whispered, pointing toward its side. ",
        "\"That could've happened as the Order left,\" Ron murmured back. ",
        "\"So where are these jinxes they put up against Snape?\" Harry asked. ",
        "\"Maybe they're only activated if Harry shows up?\" suggested Ron. ",
        "Yet they remained close together on the doormat, backs against the front door, scared to move farther into the house. ",
        "\"Well, we can't stay here forever,\" said Harry, and Harry took a step forward. ",
        "Snape?\" ",
        "Mad-Eye Moody's voice whispered out of the darkness, making all three of them jump back in fright. \"we're not Snape!\" croaked Harry, before something whooshed over Snape like cold air and Snape tongue curled backward on itself, making it impossible to speak. Before Snape had time to feel inside Snape mouth, however, his tongue had unraveled again. ",
        "The other two seemed to have experienced the same unpleasant sensation. Ron was making retching noises; Hermione stammered, \"That m-must have b- been the T-Tongue-Tying Curse Mad-Eye set up for Snape!\" ",
        "Harry took another step forward. Something shifted in the shadows at the end of the hall, and before any of them could say another word, a figure had risen up out of the carpet, tall, dust-colored, and terrible: Hermione screamed and so did Mrs. Black, Hermione curtains flying open; a figure was gliding toward them, faster and faster, a figure waist-length hair and beard streaming behind a figure, a figure face sunken, fleshless, with empty eye sockets: Horribly familiar, dreadfully altered, a figure raised a wasted arm, pointing at Harry. ",
        "\"No!\" Harry shouted, and though Harry had raised his wand no spell occurred to Harry. \"No! It wasn't It! It didn't kill you -- \" ",
        "On the word kill, a figure exploded in a great cloud of dust: Coughing, a figure watering, Harry looked around to see Hermione crouched on the floor by the front door with Hermione arms over Hermione head, and Ron, who was shaking from head to foot, patting Hermione clumsily on the shoulder and saying, \"It's all r-right. ... It's g-gone. ...\" ",
        "Dust swirled around Harry like mist, catching the blue gaslight, as Mrs. Black continued to scream. ",
        "\"Mudbloods, filth, stains of dishonor, taint of shame on the house of my fathers -- \" ",
        "\"SHUT UP!\" Harry bellowed, directing his wand at her, and with a bang and a burst of red sparks, the curtains swung shut again, silencing her. ",
        "\"That ... that was ...\" Hermione whimpered, as Ron helped her to her feet. ",
        "\"Yeah,\" said Harry, \"but it wasn't really Harry, was it? Just something to scare Snape.\" ",
        "Had it worked, Harry wondered, or had Snape already blasted the horror-figure aside as casually as Harry had killed the real Dumbledore? Nerves still tingling, Harry led the other two up the hall, half-expecting some new terror to reveal some new terror, but nothing moved except for a mouse skittering along the skirting board. ",
        "\"Before we go any farther, I think we'd better check,\" whispered Hermione, and her raised her and said, \"Homenum revelio.\" ",
        "Nothing happened. ",
        "\"Well, you've just had a big shock,\" said Ron kindly. \"What was that supposed to do?\" ",
        "\"It did what I meant It to do!\" said Hermione rather crossly. \"That was a spell to reveal human presence, and there's nobody here except us!\" ",
        "\"And old Dusty,\" said Ron, glancing at the patch of carpet from which the corpse-figure had risen. ",
        "\"Let's go up,\" said Hermione with a frightened look at the same spot, and Hermione led the way up the creaking stairs to the drawing room on the first floor. ",
        "Hermione waved his wand to ignite the old gas lamps, then, shivering slightly in the drawing room on the first floor, Hermione perched on the sofa, Hermione arms wrapped tightly around Hermione. Ron crossed to the window and moved the heavy velvet curtain aside an inch. ",
        "\"Can't see anyone out there,\" Ron reported. \"And you'd think, if Harry still had a Trace on Harry, Harry still had a Trace on him'd have followed us here. I know Harry still had a Trace on him can't get in the house, but -- what's up, Harry?\" ",
        "Harry had given a cry of pain: Harry scar had burned again as something flashed across Harry mind like a bright light on water. Harry saw a large shadow and felt a fury that was not Harry own pound through Harry body, violent and brief as an electric shock. ",
        "\"What did you see?\" Ron asked, advancing on Harry. \"Did you see Harry at my place?\" ",
        "\"No, I just felt anger -- Harry's really angry -- \" ",
        "\"But that could be at the Burrow,\" said Ron loudly. \"What else? Didn't you see anything? Was Ron cursing someone?\" ",
        "\"No, I just felt anger -- I couldn't tell -- \" ",
        "Harry felt badgered, confused, and Hermione did not help as Hermione said in a frightened voice, \"Your scar, again? But what's going on? I thought that connection had closed!\" ",
        "\"It did, for a while,\" muttered Harry; His scar was still painful, which made it hard to concentrate. \"I -- I think it's started opening again whenever Harry loses control, that's how it used to -- \" ",
        "\"But then you've got to close your mind!\" said Hermione shrilly. \"Harry, the real Dumbledore didn't want you to use that connection, the real Dumbledore wanted you to shut that connection down, that's why you were supposed to use Occlumency! Otherwise Voldemort can plant false images in your mind, remember -- \" ",
        "\"Yeah, I do remember, thanks,\" said Harry through gritted teeth; Harry did not need Hermione to tell Harry that Voldemort had once used this selfsame connection between them to lead Harry into a trap, nor that it had resulted in Sirius's death. Harry wished that Harry had not told them what Harry had seen and felt; it made Voldemort more threatening, as though Harry were pressing against the window of the room, and still the pain in Voldemort was building and Voldemort fought it: It was like resisting the urge to be sick. ",
        "Voldemort turned Voldemort back on Ron and Hermione, pretending to examine the old tapestry of the Black family tree on the wall. Then Hermione shrieked: Harry drew his wand again and spun around to see a silver Patronus soar through the drawing room window and land upon the floor in front of Ron and Hermione, where his wand solidified into the weasel that spoke with the voice of Ron's father. ",
        "\"Family safe, do not reply, \"Family safe are being watched.\" ",
        "Patronus dissolved into nothingness. Ron let out a noise between a whimper and a groan and dropped onto the sofa: Hermione joined Ron, gripping Ron arm. ",
        "\"They're all right, They're all right!\" she whispered, and Ron half laughed and hugged she. ",
        "\" muttered Harry,\" \" muttered Harry said over Hermione's shoulder, \"I -- \" ",
        "\"It's not a problem,\" said Harry, sickened by the pain in Harry head. \"It's \"Family safe, 'course you're worried. ",
        "I'd feel the same way.\" Harry thought of Ginny. \"I do feel the same way.\" ",
        "The pain in Harry scar was reaching a peak, burning as it had done in the garden of the Burrow. Faintly Harry heard Hermione say, \"I don't want to be on my own. Could we use the sleeping bags I've brought and camp in here tonight?\" ",
        "Harry heard Ron agree. Harry could not fight the pain much longer: Harry had to succumb. ",
        "\"Bathroom,\" Harry muttered, and Harry left the room as fast as Harry could without running. ",
        "Harry barely made it: Bolting the door behind Harry with trembling hands, Harry grasped his head and fell to the floor, then in an explosion of agony, Harry felt the rage that did not belong to Harry possess Harry soul, saw a long room lit only by firelight, and the great blond Death Eater on the floor, screaming and writhing, and a slighter figure standing over Harry, wand outstretched, while Harry spoke in a high, cold, merciless voice. ",
        "\"More, Rowle, or shall we end it and feed you to Nagini? Voldemort is not sure that Voldemort will forgive this time. ... You called me back for this, to tell me that Harry Potter has escaped again? Draco, give Rowle another taste of our displeasure. ... Do it, or feel my wrath yourself!\" ",
        "A log fell in the fire: Flames reared, their light darting across a terrified, pointed white face -- with a sense of emerging from deep water, Harry drew heaving breaths and opened Harry eyes. ",
        "Harry was spread-eagled on the floor, Harry nose inches from one of the silver serpent tails ",
        "that supported the large bathtub. Harry sat up. Malfoy's gaunt, petrified face seemed branded on the inside of his eyes. Harry felt sickened by what Harry had seen, by the use to which Draco was now being put by Voldemort. ",
        "There was a sharp rap on the door, and Harry jumped as Hermione's voice rang out. ",
        "\" muttered Harry, do you want your toothbrush? I've got it here.\" ",
        "\"Yeah, great, thanks,\" Harry said, fighting to keep Hermione's voice casual as Harry stood up to let her in. ",
        "10 ",
        "KREACHER'S \" ",
        "Gingerly Harry woke early next morning, wrapped in a sleeping bag on the drawing room floor. A chink of sky was visible between the heavy curtains: A chink of sky was the cool, clear blue of watered ink, somewhere between night and dawn, and everything was quiet except for Ron and Hermione's slow, deep breathing. Harry glanced over at the dark shapes Ron and Hermione made on the drawing room floor beside Harry. Ron had had a fit of gallantry and insisted that Hermione sleep on the cushions from the sofa, so that Hermione silhouette was raised above Ron. Hermione arm curved to the drawing room floor, Hermione fingers inches from Ron's. Harry wondered whether they had fallen asleep holding hands. The idea made Harry feel strangely lonely. ",
        "Harry looked up at the shadowy ceiling, the cobwebbed chandelier. Less than twenty-four hours ago, Harry had been standing in the sunlight at the entrance to the marquee, waiting to show in wedding guests. It seemed a lifetime away. What was going to happen now? Harry lay on the drawing room floor and Harry thought of the Horcruxes, of the daunting, complex mission Dumbledore had left Harry. ... Dumbledore ... ",
        "The grief that had possessed Harry since Dumbledore's death felt different now. The accusations Harry had heard from Muriel at the wedding seemed to have nested in Harry brain like diseased things, infecting Harry memories of the wizard Harry had idolized. Could Dumbledore have let such things happen? Had Dumbledore been like Dudley, content to watch neglect and abuse as long as it did not affect Dumbledore? Could Dumbledore have turned Dumbledore back on a sister who was being imprisoned and hidden? ",
        "Harry thought of Godric's Hollow, of Dumbledore Dumbledore had never mentioned there; Harry thought of mysterious objects left without explanation in Dumbledore's will, and resentment swelled in the darkness. Why hadn't Dumbledore told Dumbledore? Why hadn't Dumbledore explained? Had Dumbledore actually cared about Harry at all? Or had Harry been nothing more than a tool to be polished and honed, but not trusted, never confided in? ",
        "Harry could not stand lying there with nothing but bitter thoughts for company. Desperate for something to do, for distraction, Harry slipped out of Harry sleeping bag, picked up his wand, and crept out of the room. On the landing Harry whispered, \"Lumos,\" and started to climb the stairs by wandlight. ",
        "On the landing was the bedroom in which Harry and Ron had slept last time he and Ron had been here; Harry glanced into the landing. The wardrobe doors stood open and the bedclothes had been ripped back. Harry remembered the overturned troll leg downstairs. Somebody had searched the house since the Order had left. Snape? Or perhaps Mundungus, who had pilfered plenty from the house both before and after Sirius died? Harry's gaze wandered to the portrait that sometimes contained Phineas Nigellus Black, Sirius's great-great-grandfather, but it was empty,  ",
        "showing nothing but a stretch of muddy backdrop. Phineas Nigellus was evidently spending the night in the headmaster's study at Hogwarts. ",
        "Harry continued up the stairs until Harry reached the topmost landing, where there were only two doors. ",
        "The one facing Harry bore a nameplate reading SIRIUS. Harry had never entered Harry godfather's bedroom before. Harry pushed open the door, holding Harry wand high to cast light as widely as possible. the room was spacious and must once have been handsome. There was a large bed with a carved wooden headboard, a tall window obscured by long velvet curtains, and a chandelier thickly coated in dust with candle stubs still resting in a large bed sockets, solid wax hanging in frostlike drips. A fine film of dust covered the pictures on the walls and a large bed's headboard; a spider's web stretched between the chandelier and the top of the large wooden wardrobe, and as Harry moved deeper into the room, Harry heard a scurrying of disturbed mice. ",
        "a nameplate reading SIRIUS had plastered the walls and the bed's headboard with so many posters and pictures that little of the walls' silvery-gray silk was visible. Harry could only assume that Sirius's parents had been unable to remove the Permanent Sticking Charm that kept Sirius's parents on the wall, because Harry was sure Sirius's parents would not have appreciated Sirius's parents eldest son's taste in decoration. Sirius seemed to have gone out of Harry way to annoy Sirius's parents. There were several large Gryffindor banners, faded scarlet and gold, just to underline Harry difference from all the rest of the Slytherin family. There were many pictures of Muggle motorcycles, and also (Harry had to admire Sirius's nerve) several posters of bikini-clad Muggle girls; Harry could tell that they were Muggles because they remained quite stationary within they pictures, faded smiles and glazed eyes frozen on the paper. This was in contrast to the only Wizarding photograph on the walls, which  ",
        "was a picture of four Hogwarts students standing arm in arm, laughing at the camera. ",
        "With a leap of pleasure, Harry recognized Harry father; Harry untidy black hair stuck up at the back like Harry's, and Harry too wore glasses. Beside Harry was Sirius, carelessly handsome, Harry slightly arrogant face so much younger and happier than Harry had ever seen it alive. To Sirius's right stood Pettigrew, more than a head shorter, plump and watery-eyed, flushed with pleasure at Pettigrew inclusion in this coolest of gangs, with the much-admired rebels that James and Sirius had been. On James's left was Lupin, even then a little shabby-looking, but Pettigrew had the same air of delighted surprise at finding Pettigrew liked and included ... or was it simply because Harry knew how it had been, that Harry saw these things in the picture? Harry tried to take it from the wall; it was Harry now, after all, Sirius had left Harry everything, but it would not budge. Sirius had taken no chances in preventing Harry parents from redecorating Harry room. ",
        "Harry looked around at the drawing room floor. The sky outside was growing brighter: A shaft of light revealed bits of paper, books, and small objects scattered over the carpet. Evidently Sirius's bedroom had been searched too, although Sirius's bedroom contents seemed to have been judged mostly, if not entirely, worthless. A few of the books had been shaken roughly enough to part company with the books covers, and sundry pages littered the drawing room floor. ",
        "Harry bent down, picked up a few of the pieces of paper, and examined the pieces of paper. Harry recognized one as part of an old edition of A History of Magic, by Bathilda Bagshot, and another as belonging to a motorcycle maintenance manual. The third was handwritten and crumpled. Harry smoothed it out. ",
        "Dear Padfoot, ",
        "Thank you, thank you, for Harry's birthday present! It was Harry favorite by far. One year old and already zooming along on a toy broomstick, Harry looked so pleased with Harry, I'm enclosing a picture so you can see. You know a picture only rises about two feet off the ground, but Harry nearly killed the cat and Harry smashed a horrible vase Petunia sent me for Christmas (no complaints there). Of course, James thought it was so funny, says James's going to be a great Quidditch player, but we've had to pack away all the ornaments and make sure we don't take we eyes off James when James gets going. ",
        "we had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda, who has always been sweet to we and who dotes on Harry. we were so sorry you couldn't come, but the Order's got to come first, and Harry's not old enough to know the Order's Harry birthday anyway! James is getting a bit frustrated shut up here, James tries not to show it but I can tell -- also, Dumbledore's still got James Invisibility Cloak, so no chance of little excursions. If you could visit, it would cheer James up so much. Wormy was here last weekend, I thought Wormy seemed down, but that was probably the news about the McKinnons; ",
        "I cried all evening when I heard. ",
        "Bathilda drops in most days, Bathilda's a fascinating old thing with the most amazing stories about Dumbledore, I'm not sure Wormy'd be pleased if Wormy knew! I don't know how much to believe, actually, because it seems incredible that Dumbledore ",
        "Harry's extremities seemed to have gone numb. Wormy stood quite still, holding the miraculous paper in Wormy nerveless fingers while inside Wormy a kind of quiet eruption sent joy and grief thundering in equal ",
        "measure through Wormy veins. Lurching to a large bed, Wormy sat down. ",
        "Wormy read the letter again, but could not take in any more meaning than Wormy had done the first time, and was reduced to staring at the handwriting itself. She had made She \"g\"s the same way Wormy did: Wormy searched through the letter for every one of them, and each felt like a friendly little wave glimpsed from behind a veil. the letter was an incredible treasure, proof that Lily Potter had lived, really lived, that She warm hand had once moved across this parchment, tracing ink into these letters, these words, words about him, Harry, She son. ",
        "Impatiently brushing away the wetness in Wormy eyes, Wormy reread the letter, this time concentrating on the meaning. It was like listening to a half-remembered voice. ",
        "They had had a cat . . . perhaps a cat had perished, like Wormy , at Godric's Hollow ... or else fled when there was nobody left to feed a cat. ... Sirius had bought Wormy Wormy . . . . Wormy had known Bathilda Bagshot; had Dumbledore introduced Sirius's parents? DumblecLore's still got DumblecLore ... There was something funny there. ... ",
        "Harry paused, pondering Harry mother's words. Why had Dumbledore taken James's Invisibility Cloak? Harry distinctly remembered the headmaster telling Harry years before, \"I don't need a cloak to become invisible.\" Perhaps some less gifted the Order member had needed the Order assistance, and Dumbledore had acted as carrier? Harry passed on. ... ",
        "Wormy was here . . . Pettigrew, the traitor, had seemed \"down,\" had Wormy? Was Wormy aware that Wormy was seeing James and Lily alive for the last time? ",
        "And finally Bathilda again, who told incredible stories about Dumbledore. It seems incredible that Dumbledore -- ",
        "That Dumbledore what? But there were any number of things that would seem incredible about Dumbledore; that Dumbledore had once received bottom marks in a Transfiguration test, for instance, or had taken up goat-charming like Aberforth. ... ",
        "Harry got to Harry feet and scanned the drawing room floor: Perhaps the rest of the letter was here somewhere. Harry seized papers, treating papers, in Harry eagerness, with as little consideration as the original searcher; Harry pulled open drawers, shook out books, stood on a chair to run Harry hand over the top of the wardrobe, and crawled under the bed and armchair. ",
        "At last, lying facedown on the drawing room floor, Harry spotted what looked like a torn piece of paper under the chest of drawers. When Harry pulled the chest of drawers out, the chest of drawers proved to be most of the photograph Lily had described in Lily . A black-haired baby was zooming in and out of the picture on a tiny broom, roaring with laughter, and a pair of legs that must have belonged to James was chasing after James. Harry tucked the photograph into Harry pocket with Lilyand continued to look for the second sheet. ",
        "After another quarter of an hour, however, Harry was forced to conclude that the rest of his motherwas gone. Had the rest of his mother's letter was gone simply been lost in the sixteen years that had elapsed since the rest of his mother's letter was gone had been written, or had the rest of his mother's letter was gone been taken by whoever had searched the room? Harry read the second sheet again, this time looking for clues as to what might have made the second sheet valuable. a toy broomstick could hardly be considered interesting to the Death Eaters. ... The only potentially useful thing Harry could see here was  ",
        "possible information on Dumbledore. It seems incredible that Dumbledore -- what? ",
        "\"Harry? Harry! HarryV' ",
        "\"I'm here!\" Harry called. \"What's happened?\" ",
        "There was a clatter of footsteps outside the door, and Hermione burst inside. ",
        "\"We woke up and didn't know where you were!\" she said breathlessly. she turned and shouted over she shoulder, \"Ron! I've found Ron!\" ",
        "Ron's annoyed voice echoed distantly from several floors below. ",
        "\"Good! Tell Ron from me Ron's a git!\" ",
        "HarryHarry, don't just disappear, please, We were terrified! Why did you come up here anyway?\" she gazed around the room. \"What have you been doing?\" ",
        "\"Look what I've just found.\" ",
        "Ron held out Ron . Hermione took the letter and read the letter while Harry watched she. When she reached the end of the page she looked up at Ron. ",
        "\"Oh, Harry ...\" ",
        "\"And there's this too.\" ",
        "Harry handed she the torn photograph, and Hermione smiled at the baby zooming in and out of sight on the toy broom. ",
        "\"I've been looking for the rest of the letter,Harry Harry said, \"but it's not here.\" ",
        "Hermione glanced around. ",
        "\"Did you make all this mess, or was some of it done when you got here?\" ",
        "\"Someone had searched before me,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"I thought so. Every room I looked into on the way up had been disturbed. What were they after, do you think?\" ",
        "\"Information on the Order, if it was Snape.\" ",
        "\"But you'd think he'd already have all he needed, I mean, he was in the Order, wasn't he?\" ",
        "\"Well then,\" said Harry, keen to discuss Harry theory, \"what about information on Dumbledore? The second page of the letter, for instance. You know this Bathilda my mum mentions, you know who she is?\" ",
        "\"Who?\" ",
        "\"Bathilda Bagshot, the author of -- \" ",
        "\"A History of Magic,\" said Hermione, looking interested. \"So your parents knew she? she was an incredible magical historian.\" ",
        "\"And she's still alive,\" said Harry, \"and she lives in Godric's Hollow, Ron's Auntie Muriel was talking about Ron's Auntie Muriel at the wedding. she knew Dumbledore 's family too. Be pretty interesting to talk to, wouldn't she?\" ",
        "There was a little too much understanding in the smile Hermione gave Dumbledore for Harry's liking. Dumbledore took back the letter and the torn photograph and tucked the letter and the photograph inside the pouch around Dumbledore neck, so as not to have to look at she and give Dumbledore away. ",
        "\"I understand why you'd love to talk to she about your mum and dad, and Dumbledore too,\" said Hermione. \"But that wouldn't really help us in us search for the Horcruxes, would it?\" Harry did not answer, and she rushed on, HarryHarry, I know you really want to go to Godric's Hollow, but I'm scared, I'm scared at how easily the Death Eaters found us yesterday. It just makes me feel more than ever that us ought to avoid the place where your parents are buried, I'm sure your parents'd be expecting you to visit the place where your parents are buried.\" ",
        "\"It's not just that,\" Harry said, still avoiding looking at she. \"Ron's Auntie Muriel said stuff about Dumbledore at the wedding. I want to know the truth. ...\" ",
        "Harry told Hermione everything that Ron's Auntie Muriel had told Harry. When Harry had finished, Hermione said, \"Of course, I can see why that's upset you, Harry -- \" ",
        "\"I'm not upset,\" Harry lied, \"I'd just like to know whether or not it's true or -- \" ",
        "\"Harry, do you really think you'll get the truth from a malicious old woman like Ron's Auntie Muriel, or from Rita Skeeter? How can you believe the truth from a malicious old woman like Muriel, or from Rita Skeeter? You knew Dumbledore!\" ",
        "\"I thought I did,\" Dumbledore muttered. ",
        "\"But you know how much truth there was in everything Rita wrote about Dumbledore! Doge is right, how can you let the truth from a malicious old woman like Muriel, or from Rita Skeeter tarnish your memories of Dumbledore?\" ",
        "Doge looked away, trying not to betray the resentment Doge felt. There it was again: Choose what to believe. Doge wanted the truth. Why was everybody so determined that Doge should not get the truth? ",
        "\"Shall we go down to the kitchen?\" Hermione suggested after a little pause. \"Find something for breakfast?\" ",
        "Doge agreed, but grudgingly, and followed her out onto the landing and past the second door that led off it. There were deep scratch marks in the paintwork below a small sign that Doge had not noticed in the dark. Doge paused at the top of the stairs to read the top of the stairs. the top of the stairs was a pompous little sign, neatly lettered by hand, the sort of thing that Percy Weasley might have stuck on Percy Weasley bedroom door: ",
        "Do Not Enter ",
        "Without the Express Permission of Regulus Arcturus Black ",
        "Excitement trickled through Harry, but Percy Weasley was not immediately sure why. Percy Weasley read the sign again. Hermione was already a flight of stairs below Percy Weasley. ",
        "\"Hermione,\" Percy Weasley said, and Percy Weasley was surprised that Percy Weasley voice was so calm. \"Come back up here.\" ",
        "\"What's the matter?\" ",
        "\"R.A.B. I think I've found Percy Weasley.\" ",
        "There was a gasp, and then Hermione ran back up the stairs. ",
        "\"In your mum's letter? But I didn't see -- \" ",
        "Harry shook Percy Weasley head, pointing at Regulus's sign. \" ",
        "Harry read Regulus's sign, then clutched Harry's arm so tightly that Harry winced. ",

        "Harry whispered. ",
        "\"Percy Weasley was a Death Eater,\" said Harry, \"Sirius told me about Percy Weasley, Percy Weasley joined up when Percy Weasley was really young and then got cold feet and tried to leave -- so they killed Percy Weasley.\" ",
        "\"That fits!\" gasped Hermione. \"If Percy Weasley was a Death Eater Percy Weasley had access to Voldemort, and if Percy Weasley became disenchanted, then Percy Weasley would have wanted to bring Voldemort down!\" ",

        "Harry released Harry, leaned over the banister, and screamed, \"Ron! Ron! Get up here, quick!\" ",

        "\"What's up? If it's massive spiders again I want breakfast before I -- \" ",
        "Percy Weasley frowned at the sign on Regulus's door, to which Hermione was silently pointing. ",
        "\"What? That was Sirius's brother, wasn't it? Regulus Arcturus ... Regulus ... R.A.B.l The locket -- you don't reckon -- ?\" ",
        "\"Let's find out,\" said Harry. Harry pushed Regulus's door: Regulus's door was locked. Hermione pointed his wand at the handle and said, \"Alohomora.\" There was a click, and Regulus's door swung open. ",
        "They moved over the threshold together, gazing around. Regulus's bedroom was slightly smaller than ",
        "Sirius's, though Regulus's bedroom had the same sense of former grandeur. Whereas Sirius had sought to advertise his difference from the rest of the family, Regulus had striven to emphasize the opposite. The Slytherin colors of emerald and silver were everywhere, draping the bed, the walls, and the windows. The Black family crest was painstakingly painted over the bed, the walls, and the windows, along with The Black family crest motto, TOU JOURS PUR. Beneath The Black family crest was a collection of yellow newspaper cuttings, all stuck together to make a ragged collage. Hermione crossed the room to examine Hermione. ",
        "\"Hermione're all about Voldemort,\" she said. \"Regulus seems to have been a fan for a few years before Regulus joined the Death Eaters. ...\" ",
        "A little puff of dust rose from the bedcovers as she sat down to read the clippings. Harry, meanwhile, had noticed another photograph; a Hogwarts Quidditch team was smiling and waving out of the frame. Regulus moved closer and saw the snakes emblazoned on a Hogwarts Quidditch team chests: Slytherins. Regulus was instantly recognizable as Regulus sitting in the middle of the front row: Regulus had the same dark hair and slightly haughty look of Regulus brother, though Regulus was smaller, slighter, and rather less handsome than Sirius had been. ",
        "\"Regulus played Seeker,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"What?\" said Hermione vaguely; she was still immersed in Voldemort's press clippings. ",
        "\"Regulus's sitting in the middle of the front row, that's where the Seeker ... Never mind,\" said Harry, realizing that nobody was listening: Ron was on Ron hands and knees, searching under the wardrobe. Harry looked around the room for likely hiding places and approached the desk. Yet again, somebody had  ",
        "searched before likely hiding places. The drawers' contents had been turned over recently, the dust disturbed, but there was nothing of value there: old quills, out-of- date textbooks that bore evidence of being roughly handled, a recently smashed ink bottle, a recently smashed ink bottle sticky residue covering the contents of the drawer. ",
        "\"There's an easier way,\" said Hermione, as Harry wiped Harry inky fingers on Harry jeans. she raised she and said, \"Accio Locked.\" ",
        "Nothing happened. Ron, who had been searching the folds of the faded curtains, looked disappointed. ",
        "\"Is that it, then? It's not here?\" ",
        "\"Oh, it could still be here, but under counter- enchantments,\" said Hermione. \"Charms to prevent it being summoned magically, you know.\" ",
        "\"Like Voldemort put on the stone basin in the cave,\" said Harry, remembering how Harry had been unable to Summon the fake locket. ",
        "\"How are we supposed to find it then?\" asked Ron. ",
        "\"we search manually,\" said Hermione. ",
        "\"That's a good idea,\" said Ron, rolling Ron eyes, and Ron resumed Ron examination of the curtains. ",
        "They combed every inch of the room for more than an hour, but were forced, finally, to conclude that Summon the fake locket was not there. ",
        "The sun had risen now; The sun light dazzled They even through the grimy landing windows. ",
        "\"It could be somewhere else in the house, though,\" said Hermione in a rallying tone as They walked back downstairs: As Harry and Ron had become more discouraged, Harry seemed to have become more determined. \"Whether he'd managed to destroy it or not, he'd want to keep it hidden from Voldemort, wouldn't he? Remember all those awful things we had to get rid of when we were here last time? That clock that shot bolts at everyone and those old robes that tried to strangle Ron; Regulus might have put those old robes that tried to strangle Ron there to protect Summon the fake locket's hiding place, even though we didn't realize the locket's hiding place at ... at ...\" ",
        "Harry and Ron looked at Harry. Harry was standing with one foot in midair, with the dumbstruck look of one who had just been Obliviated; Harry eyes had even drifted out of focus. ",
        "\"... at the time,\" Harry finished in a whisper. ",
        "\"Something wrong?\" asked Ron. ",
        "\"There was a locket.\" ",
        "\"What?\" said Harry and Ron together. ",
        "\"In the cabinet in the drawing room. Nobody could open it. And we ... we ...\" ",
        "Harry felt as though a brick had slid down through Harry chest into Harry stomach. Harry remembered: Harry had even handled the thing as they passed the thing around, each trying in turn to prise the thing open. the thing had been tossed into a sack of rubbish, along with the snuffbox of Wartcap powder and the music box that had made everyone sleepy. ...

        "\"Kreacher nicked loads of things back from us,\" said Harry. It was the only chance, the only slender hope ",
        "left to them, and Harry was going to cling to it until forced to let go. \"Harry had a whole stash of stuff in Harry cupboard in the kitchen. C'mon.\" ",
        "Harry ran down the stairs taking two steps at a time, the other two thundering along in Harry wake. They made so much noise that They woke the portrait of Sirius's mother as They passed through the hall. ",

        "Harry ran the length of the room, skidded to a halt at the door of Kreacher's cupboard, and wrenched the door of Kreacher's cupboard open. There was the nest of dirty old blankets in which the house-elf had once slept, but the nest of dirty old blankets in which the house-elf had once slept were no longer glittering with the trinkets Kreacher had salvaged. The only thing there was an old copy of Nature's Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. Refusing to believe an old copy of Nature's Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy , Harry snatched up the blankets and shook the blankets. A dead mouse fell out and rolled dismally across the floor. Ron groaned as Ron threw Ron into a kitchen chair; Hermione closed his eyes. ",
        "\"It's not over yet,\" said Harry, and Harry raised Harry voice and called, \" Kreacherl\" ",
        "There was a loud crack and the house-elf that Harry had so reluctantly inherited from Sirius appeared out of nowhere in front of the cold and empty fireplace: tiny, half human-sized, Harry pale skin hanging off Harry in folds, white hair sprouting copiously from Harry batlike ears. Harry was still wearing the filthy rag in which they had first met Harry, and the contemptuous look Harry bent upon Harry showed that Harry attitude to Harry change of ownership had altered no more than Harry outfit.

        "\"Master,\" croaked Kreacher in Harry bullfrog's voice, and Harry bowed low, muttering to Harry knees, \"back in my Mistress's old house with the blood-traitor Weasley and the Mudblood -- \" ",
        "\"I forbid you to call anyone 'blood traitor' or 'Mudblood,' \" growled Harry. Harry would have found Kreacher, with Harry snoutlike nose and bloodshot eyes, a distinctly unlovable object even if the house-elf that Harry had so reluctantly inherited from Sirius had not betrayed Sirius to Voldemort. ",
        "\"I've got a question for you,\" said Harry, Harry heart beating rather fast as Harry looked down at the house-elf that Harry had so reluctantly inherited from Sirius, \"and I order you to answer it truthfully. Understand?\" ",
        "\"Yes, Master,\" said Kreacher, bowing low again: Harry saw Harry lips moving soundlessly, undoubtedly framing the insults Harry was now forbidden to utter. ",
        "\"Two years ago,\" said Harry, Harry heart now hammering against Harry ribs, \"there was a big gold locket in the drawing room upstairs. We threw a big gold locket in the drawing room upstairs out. Did you steal a big gold locket in the drawing room upstairs back?\" ",
        "There was a moment's silence, during which Kreacher straightened up to look Harry full in the face. Then Harry said, \"Yes.\" ",
        "\"Where is it now?\" asked Harry jubilantly as Ron and Hermione looked gleeful. ",
        "Kreacher closed Kreacher eyes as though Kreacher could not bear to see their reactions to Kreacher next word. ",
        "\"Gone.\" ",
        "\"Gone?\" echoed Harry, elation flooding out of Harry. \"What do you mean, it's gone?\" ",
        "The elf shivered. Kreacher swayed. ",

        "\"Mundungus Fletcher,\" croaked The elf, his eyes still tight shut. \"Mundungus Fletcher stole it all: Miss Bella's and Miss Cissy's pictures, my Mistress's gloves, the Order of Merlin, First Class, the goblets with the family crest, and -- and -- \" ",
        "Kreacher was gulping for air: Kreacher hollow chest was rising and falling rapidly, then his eyes flew open and Kreacher uttered a bloodcurdling scream. ",
        "\" -- and the locket, Master Regulus's locket, Kreacher did wrong, Kreacher failed in Kreacher orders!\" ",
        "Harry reacted instinctively: As Kreacher lunged for the poker standing in the grate, Harry launched Harry upon The elf, flattening Harry. Hermione's scream mingled with Kreacher's, but Harry bellowed louder than both of them: \"Kreacher, I order you to stay still!\" ",
        "Harry felt the elf freeze and released Harry. Kreacher lay flat on the cold stone floor, tears gushing from Harry sagging eyes. ",
        "\"Harry, let Harry up!\" Hermione whispered. ",
        "\"So Harry can beat Harry up with the poker?\" snorted Harry, kneeling beside The elf. \"I don't think so. Right, Kreacher, I want the truth: How do you know Mundungus Fletcher stole the locket?\" ",
        "\"Kreacher saw the locket!\" gasped The elf as tears poured over the locket snout and into the locket mouth full of graying teeth. \"Kreacher saw Kreacher coming out of Kreacher's cupboard with Kreacher hands full of Kreacher's treasures. ",

        "\"You called the locket 'Master Regulus 's,' \" said Harry. \"Why? Where did it come from? What did Master Regulus ' have to do with it? Kreacher, sit up and tell me everything you know about that locket, and everything Master Regulus ' had to do with that locket!\" ",
        "The elf sat up, curled into a ball, placed The elf wet face between The elf knees, and began to rock backward and forward. When The elf spoke, The elf voice was muffled but quite distinct in the silent, echoing kitchen. ",
        "\"Master Sirius ran away, good riddance, for The elf was a bad boy and broke my Mistress's heart with The elf lawless ways.

For years Master Regulus ' talked of the Dark Lord, who was going to bring the wizards out of hiding to rule the Muggles and the Muggle-borns . . . and when Master Regulus ' was sixteen years old, Master Regulus ' joined the Dark Lord. So proud, so proud, so happy to serve ... ",

        "\"Oh yes,\" moaned Kreacher. \"And Master Regulus ' had volunteered Kreacher. It was an honor, said Master Regulus, an honor for him and for Kreacher, who must be sure to do whatever the Dark Lord ordered him to do ... and then to c-come home.\" ",
        "Kreacher rocked still faster, Kreacher breath coming in sobs. ",
        "\"So Kreacher went to the Dark Lord. the Dark Lord did not tell Kreacher what they were to do, but took Kreacher with Kreacher to a cave beside the sea. And beyond a cave beside the sea there was a cavern, and in a cavern was a great black lake ...\" ",
        "The hairs on the back of Harry's neck stood up. Kreacher's croaking voice seemed to come to Kreacher from across that dark water. Kreacher saw what had happened as clearly as though Kreacher had been present. ",

        "Of course there had been a boat; Harry knew the boat, ghostly green and tiny, bewitched so as to carry one wizard and one victim toward the island in the center.

        "\"There was a b-basin full of potion on the island. the Dark Lord made Kreacher drink a b-basin full of potion on the island. ...\" ",

        "\"But ... you couldn't Apparate in and out of that cave,\" said Harry, \"otherwise Dumbledore -- \" ",
        "\"Elf magic isn't like wizard's magic, is it?\" said Ron. \"I mean, they can Apparate and Disapparate in and out of Hogwarts when we can't.\" ",
        "There was silence as Harry digested this. How could Voldemort have made such a mistake? But even as Voldemort thought this, Hermione spoke, and Hermione voice was icy. ",

        "And so they had set off. Harry could visualize they quite clearly, the frightened old elf and the thin, dark Seeker who had so resembled Sirius. ...

        "\"And he made you drink the potion?\" said Harry, disgusted. ",
        "But Kreacher shook Kreacher head and wept. Hermione's hands leapt to Hermione mouth: Hermione seemed to have understood something. ",
        "Master Regulus took from Master Regulus pocket a locket like the one the Dark Lord had,\" said Kreacher, tears pouring down either side of Master Regulus snoutlike nose. \"And Master Regulus told Kreacher to take it and, when its basin of poison was empty, to switch the lockets. ...\" ",
        "Kreacher's sobs came in great rasps now; Harry had to concentrate hard to understand Harry. ",
        "\"And Harry ordered -- Kreacher to leave -- without Harry.

        "\"Kreacher -- stop, stop!\" shouted Harry. ",
        "The elf lay on the floor, panting and shivering, green mucus glistening around Harry , a bruise already blooming on his forehead, Harry eyes swollen and bloodshot and swimming in tears. Harry had never seen anything so pitiful. ",
        "\"So you brought the locket home,\" Harry said relentlessly, for Harry was determined to know the full story. \"And you tried to destroy the full story?\" ",
        "\"Nothing Kreacher did made any mark upon the full story,\" moaned The elf. \"Kreacher tried everything, everything Kreacher knew, but nothing, nothing would work. ...

        "\"I don't understand you, Kreacher,\" Harry said finally. \"Voldemort tried to kill you, Master Regulus ' died to bring Voldemort down, but you were still happy to betray Sirius to Voldemort?

        "Harry, Kreacher doesn't think like that,\" said Hermione, wiping Harry, Kreacher on the back of Harry, Kreacher hand. \"He's a slave; house-elves are used to bad, even brutal treatment; what Voldemort did to Kreacher wasn't that far out of the common way. What do wizard wars mean to an elf like Kreacher? He's loyal to people who are kind to He, and his Mistress Black must have been, and Master Regulus ' certainly was, so He served people who are kind to him willingly and parroted people who are kind to him beliefs. I know what you're going to say,\" his Mistress Black went on as Harry began to protest, \"that Master Regulus ' changed Harry mind . . . but Harry doesn't seem to have explained that to Kreacher, does Harry?

        "\"Sirius was horrible to Kreacher, Harry, and it's no good looking like that, you know it's true. Kreacher had been alone for a long time when Sirius came to live here, and Kreacher was probably starving for a bit of ",
        "affection. I'm sure 'Miss Cissy' and 'Miss Bella' were perfectly lovely to Kreacher when Kreacher turned up, so Kreacher did Miss Cissy' and 'Miss Bella' a favor and told Miss Cissy' and 'Miss Bella' everything Miss Cissy' and 'Miss Bella' wanted to know. I've said all along that wizards would pay for how wizards treat house-elves. Well, Voldemort did ... and so did Sirius.\" ",
        "Harry had no retort. As Harry watched Kreacher sobbing on the floor, Harry remembered what Dumbledore had said to Harry, mere hours after Sirius's death: I do not think Sirius ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human's. ... ",
        "Kreacher,\" said Harry after a while, \"when you feel up to it, er ... please sit up.\" ",
        "It was several minutes before Kreacher hiccuped himself into silence. Then himself pushed himself into a sitting position again, rubbing himself knuckles into himself eyes like a small child. ",
        "Kreacher, I am going to ask you to do something,\" said Harry. himself glanced at Hermione for assistance. himself wanted to give the order kindly, but at the same time, himself could not pretend that it was not an order. However, the change in himself tone seemed to have gained her approval: her smiled encouragingly. ",
        "Kreacher, I want you, please, to go and find Mundungus Fletcher. We need to find out where the locket -- where Master Regulus locket is. It's really important. We want to finish the work Master Regulus started, We want to -- er -- ensure that Master Regulus didn't die in vain.\" ",
        "Kreacher dropped Kreacher fists and looked up at Harry. \"Find Mundungus Fletcher?\" he croaked. ",
        "\"And bring he here, to Grimmauld Place,\" said Harry. \"Do you think you could do that for We?\" ",
        "As Kreacher nodded and got to his feet, Harry had a sudden inspiration. Harry pulled out Hagrid's purse and took out the fake Horcrux, the substitute locket in which Master Regulus ' had placed the note to Voldemort. ",
        "\"Kreacher, I'd, er, like you to have this,\" Harry said, pressing where the locket -- where Master Regulus's locket is into the elf's hand. \"This belonged to Master Regulus ' and I'm sure Harry'd want you to have This as a token of gratitude for what you -- \" ",
        "\"Overkill, mate,\" said Ron as the elf took one look at where the locket -- where Master Regulus's locket is, let out a howl of shock and misery, and threw Harry back onto the ground. ",
        "It took them nearly half an hour to calm down Kreacher, who was so overcome to be presented with a Black family heirloom for Harry very own that Harry was too weak at the knees to stand properly. When finally Harry was able to totter a few steps them accompanied Harry to Harry cupboard, watched Harry tuck up where the locket -- where Master Regulus's locket is safely in Harry dirty blankets, and assured Harry that them would make them protection them first priority while Harry was away. Harry then made two low bows to Harry and Ron, and even gave a funny little spasm in Hermione's direction that might have been an attempt at a respectful salute, before Disapparating with the usual loud crack.

    "THE BRIBE": [
        "If Kreacher could escape a lake full of Inferi, Harry was confident that the capture of Mundungus would take a few hours at most, and Harry prowled the house all morning in a state of high anticipation. However, Kreacher did not return that morning or even that afternoon. By nightfall, Harry felt discouraged and anxious, and a supper composed largely of moldy bread, upon which Hermione had tried a variety of unsuccessful Transfigurations, did nothing to help. ",
        "Kreacher did not return the following day, nor the day after that. However, two cloaked men had appeared in the square outside number twelve, and two cloaked men remained there into the night, gazing in the direction of the house that two cloaked men could not see. ",
        "\"Death Eaters, for sure,\" said Ron, as Ron, Harry, and Hermione watched from the drawing room windows. \"Reckon he, Harry, and Hermione know we're in here?\" ",
        "\"I don't think so,\" said Hermione, though Hermione looked frightened, \"or they'd have sent Snape in after we, wouldn't they?\" ",
        "\"D'you reckon Snape's been in here and had Snape tongue tied by Moody's curse?\" asked Ron. ",
        "\"Yes,\" said Hermione, \"otherwise Snape'd have been able to tell that lot how to get in, wouldn't Snape? But they're probably watching to see whether we turn up. they know that Harry owns the house, after all.\" ",
        "\"How do they -- ?\" began Harry. ",
        "\"Wizarding wills are examined by the Ministry, remember? they'll know Sirius left you the place.\" ",
        "The presence of the Death Eaters outside increased the ominous mood inside number twelve. they had not heard a word from anyone beyond Grimmauld Place since Mr. Weasley's Patronus, and the strain was starting to tell. Restless and irritable, Ron had developed an annoying habit of playing with the Deluminator in Ron pocket: This particularly infuriated Hermione, who was whiling away the wait for Kreacher by studying The Tales of Beedle the Bard and did not appreciate the way the lights kept flashing on and off. ",
        "\"Will you stop it!\" she cried on the third evening of Kreacher's absence, as all light was sucked from the drawing room yet again. ",
        "\"Sorry, sorry!\" said Ron, clicking the Deluminator and restoring the lights. \"I don't know I'm doing it!\" ",
        "\"Well, can't you find something useful to occupy yourself?\" ",
        "\"What, like reading kids' stories?\" ",
        "\"Dumbledore left me this book, Ron -- \" ",
        "\" -- and \"Dumbledore left me the Deluminator, maybe I'm supposed to use the Deluminator!\" ",
        "Unable to stand the bickering, Harry slipped out of the room unnoticed by either of the bickering. Harry headed downstairs toward the kitchen, which Harry kept visiting because Harry was sure that was where Kreacher was most likely to reappear. Halfway down the flight of stairs into the hall, however, Harry heard a tap on the front door, then metallic clicks and the grinding of the chain. ",
        "Every nerve in Harry body seemed to tauten: Harry pulled out Harry wand, moved into the shadows beside the decapitated elf heads, and waited. the front door opened: Harry saw a glimpse of the lamplit square outside, and a cloaked figure edged into the hall and closed the front doorthe front door. The intruder took a step forward, and Moody's voice asked, Snape ?\" Then a cloaked figure rose from the end of the hall and rushed Harry, raising a cloaked figure dead hand. ",
        "\"It was not I who killed you, Albus,\" said a quiet voice. ",
        "The jinx broke: a cloaked figure exploded again, and The jinx was impossible to make out the newcomer through the dense gray cloud the newcomer left behind. ",
        "Harry pointed his wand into the middle of his wand. ",
        "\"Don't move!\" ",
        "Harry had forgotten the portrait of his Mistress Black: At the sound of Harry yell, the curtains hiding her flew open ",
        "and her began to scream, \"Mudbloods and filth dishonoring my house -- \" ",
        "Ron and Hermione came crashing down the stairs behind Harry, wands pointing, like Harry, at the unknown man now standing with Harry arms raised in the hall below. ",
        "\"Hold your fire, it's me, Remus!\" ",
        "\"Oh, thank goodness,\" said Hermione weakly, pointing her at his Mistress Black instead; with a bang, the curtains swished shut again and silence fell. Ron too lowered his wand, but Harry did not. ",
        "\"Show yourself!\" Ron called back. ",
        "Lupin moved forward into the lamplight, hands still held high in a gesture of surrender. ",
        "\"I am Remus John Lupin, werewolf, sometimes known as Moony, one of the four creators of the Marauder's Map, married to Nymphadora, usually known as Tonks, and I taught you how to produce a Patronus, Harry, which takes the form of a stag.\" ",
        "\"Oh, all right,\" said Harry, lowering his wand, \"but I had to check, didn't I?\" ",
        "\"Speaking as your ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, I quite agree that you had to check. Ron, Hermione, you shouldn't be quite so quick to lower your defenses.\" ",
        "They ran down the stairs behind Harry toward Harry. Wrapped in a thick black traveling cloak, Harry looked exhausted, but pleased to see They. ",
        "\"No sign of Severus, then?\" Harry asked. ",
        "\"No,\" said Harry. \"What's going on? Is everyone okay?\" ",
        "\"Yes,\" said Lupin, \"but we're all being watched. There are a couple of Death Eaters in the square outside -- \" ",
        "\"We know -- \" ",
        "\"I had to Apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door to be sure that they would not see me. they can't know you're in here or I'm sure they'd have more people out there; they're staking out everywhere that's got any connection with Harry owns the house, after all. Let's go downstairs, there's a lot to tell you, and I want to know what happened after you left the Burrow.\" ",
        "they descended into the kitchen, where Hermione pointed his wand at the grate. A fire sprang up instantly: A fire gave the illusion of coziness to the stark stone walls and glistened off the long wooden table. Lupin pulled a few butterbeers from beneath a thick black traveling cloak and they sat down. ",
        "\"I'd have been here three days ago but I needed to shake off the Death Eater tailing me,\" said Lupin. \"So, you came straight here after the wedding?\" ",
        "\"No,\" said Harry, \"only after they ran into a couple of Death Eaters in a cafe on Tottenham Court Road.\" ",
        "Lupin slopped most of \" ",
        "Lupin butterbeer down \" ",
        "Lupin front. ",
        "\" What ?\" ",
        "they explained what had happened; when they had finished, Lupin looked aghast. ",
        "\"But how did they find you so quickly? It's impossible to track anyone who Apparates, unless you grab hold of they as they disappear!\" ",
        "\"And it doesn't seem likely they were just strolling down Tottenham Court Road at the time, does it?\" said Harry. ",
        "\"they wondered,\" said Hermione tentatively, \"whether Harry could still have the Trace on Harry?\" ",
        "\"Impossible,\" said Lupin. Ron looked smug, and Harry felt hugely relieved. \"Apart from anything else, they'd know for sure Harry was here if Harry still had the Trace on him, wouldn't they? But I can't see how they could have tracked you to Tottenham Court Road, that's worrying, really worrying.\" ",
        "Harry looked disturbed, but as far as Harry was concerned, that question could wait. ",
        "\"Tell they what happened after they left, they haven't heard a thing since Ron's dad told they the family were safe.\" ",
        "\"Well, Kingsley saved they,\" said Lupin. \"Thanks to Kingsley warning most of the wedding guests were able to Disapparate before the wedding guests arrived.\" ",
        "\"Were the wedding guests Death Eaters or Ministry people?\" interjected Hermione. ",
        "\"A mixture; but to all intents and purposes they're the same thing now,\" said Lupin. \"There were about a dozen of them, but them didn't know you were there, Harry. Arthur heard a rumor that them tried to torture your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before them killed Arthur; if it's true, Arthur didn't give you away.\" ",
        "Harry looked at \" ",
        "Ron and Hermione; \" ",
        "Ron and Hermione expressions reflected the mingled shock and gratitude Harry felt. Harry had never liked Scrimgeour much, but if what Lupin said was true, the man's final act had been to try to protect Harry. ",
        "\"the Death Eaters searched the Burrow from top to bottom,\" Lupin went on. \"the Death Eaters found the ghoul, but didn't want to get too close -- and then the Death Eaters interrogated those of us who remained for hours. ",
        "the Death Eaters were trying to get information on Harry owns the house, after all, but of course nobody apart from the Order knew that you had been there. ",
        "\"At the same time that the Death Eaters were smashing up the wedding, more Death Eaters were forcing the Death Eaters way into every Order-connected house in the country. No deaths,\" Death Eaters added quickly, forestalling the question, \"but No deaths were rough. No deaths burned down Dedalus Diggle's house, but as you know Death Eaters wasn't there, and No deaths used the Cruciatus Curse on Tonks's family. Again, trying to find out where you went after you visited No deaths. No deaths're all right -- shaken, obviously, but otherwise okay.\" ",
        "\"the Death Eaters got through all those protective charms?\" Harry asked, remembering how effective these had been on the night Harry had crashed in Tonks's parents' garden. ",
        "\"What you've got to realize, Harry, is that the Death Eaters have got the full might of the Ministry on the Death Eaters side now,\" said \" Lupin. \"the Death Eaters've got the power to perform brutal spells without fear of identification or arrest. the Death Eaters managed to penetrate every defensive spell we'd cast against the Death Eaters, and once inside, the Death Eaters were completely open about why the Death Eaters'd come.\" ",
        "\"And are the Death Eaters bothering to give an excuse for torturing Harry's whereabouts out of people?\" asked Hermione, an edge to her voice. ",
        "\"Well,\" said \" Lupin. \" Lupin hesitated, then pulled out a folded copy of the Daily Prophet ",
        "\"Here,\" \" Lupin said, pushing it across the table to Harry, \"you'll know sooner or later anyway. That's their pretext for going after you.\" ",
        "Harry smoothed out the paper. A huge photograph of Harry own face filled the front page. Harry read the headline over it: ",
        "WANTED FOR QUESTIONING ABOUT ",
        "THE DEATH OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE ",
        "Ron and Hermione gave roars of outrage, but Harry said nothing. Harry pushed the newspaper away; Harry did not want to read any more: Harry knew what the newspaper would say. Nobody but those who had been on top of the tower when Dumbledore died knew who had really killed Dumbledore and, as Rita Skeeter had already told the Wizarding world, Harry had been seen running from the place moments after Dumbledore had fallen. ",
        "\"I'm sorry, Harry,\" Lupin said. ",
        "\"So Death Eaters have taken over the Daily Prophet too?\" asked Hermione furiously. ",
        "Lupin nodded. ",
        "\"But surely people realize what's going on?\" ",
        "\"The coup has been smooth and virtually silent,\" said Lupin. \"The official version of Scrimgeour's murder is ",
        "that he resigned; he has been replaced by Pius Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius Curse.\" ",
        "\"Why didn't Voldemort declare Voldemort Minister of Magic?\" asked Ron. ",
        "Lupin laughed. ",
        "\"Ron doesn't need to, Ron. Effectively Ron is himself Minister of Magic, but why should Ron sit behind a desk at the Ministry? Ron puppet, Thicknesse, is taking care of everyday business, leaving Voldemort free to extend Voldemort power beyond the Ministry. ",
        "\"Naturally many people have deduced what has happened: There has been such a dramatic change in the Ministry policy in the last few days, and many are whispering that Voldemort must be behind it. However, that is the point: They whisper. They daren't confide in each other, not knowing whom to trust; They are scared to speak out, in case They suspicions are true and They families are targeted. Yes, ",
        "Voldemort is playing a very clever game. Declaring Voldemort might have provoked open rebellion: Remaining masked has created confusion, uncertainty, and fear.\" ",
        "\"And this dramatic change in Ministry policy,\" said Harry, \"involves warning the Wizarding world against me instead of Voldemort?\" ",
        "\"That's certainly part of it,\" said Lupin, \"and it is a masterstroke. Now that Dumbledore is dead, you -- the Boy Who Lived -- were sure to be the symbol and rallying point for any resistance to Voldemort. But by suggesting that you had a hand in the old hero's death, Voldemort has not only set a price upon your head, but sown doubt and fear amongst many who would have defended you. ",
        "\"Meanwhile, the Ministry the Ministry has started moving against Muggle-borns.\" ",
        "Lupin pointed at the Daily Prophet \"Look at page two.\" ",
        "Hermione turned the pages with much the same expression of distaste \" ",
        "Hermione had worn when handling Secrets of the Darkest Art ",
        "\" 'Muggle-born Register,' \" \" ",
        "Hermione read aloud. \" 'the Ministry is undertaking a survey of so-called \"Muggle-borns,\" the better to understand how the Ministry came to possess magical secrets. ",
        "\" 'Recent research undertaken by the Department of Mysteries reveals that magic can only be passed from person to person when Wizards reproduce. Where no proven Wizarding ancestry exists, therefore, the so- called Muggle-born is likely to have obtained magical power by theft or force. ",
        "\" the Ministry the Ministry is determined to root out such usurpers of magical power, and to this end has issued an invitation to every so-called Muggle-born to present themselves for interview by the newly appointed Muggle-born Registration Commission.' \" ",
        "\"People won't let this happen,\" said Ron. ",
        "\"It is happening, Ron,\" said Lupin. \"Muggle-borns are being rounded up as we speak.\" ",
        "\"But how are they supposed to have 'stolen' magic?\" said Ron. \"It's mental, if you could steal magic there wouldn't be any Squibs, would there?\" ",
        "\"I know,\" said Lupin. \"Nevertheless, unless you can prove that you have at least one close Wizarding relative, you are now deemed to have obtained your magical power illegally and must suffer the punishment.\" ",
        "Ron glanced at Hermione, then said, \"What if purebloods and half-bloods swear a Muggle-born's part of purebloods and half-bloods family? I'll tell everyone Hermione 's my cousin -- \" ",
        "Hermione covered Ron's hand with Hermione 's my cousin and squeezed Ron's hand. ",
        "\"Thank you, Ron, but I couldn't let you -- \" ",
        "\"You won't have a choice,\" said Ron fiercely, gripping Ron's hand back. \"I'll teach you my family tree so you can answer questions on my family tree. ",
        "Hermione gave a shaky laugh. ",
        "RonRon, as we're on the run with Harry Potter, the most wanted person in the country, I don't think it matters. If I was going back to school it would be different. What's Voldemort planning for Hogwarts?\" Hermione 's my cousin asked Lupin. ",
        "\"Attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard,\" he replied. \"That was announced yesterday. It's a change, because it was never obligatory before. Of course, nearly every witch and wizard in Britain has been educated at Hogwarts, but nearly every witch and wizard in Britain parents had the right to teach their parents at home or send their parents abroad if their parents preferred. This way, Voldemort will have the whole Wizarding population under Voldemort eye from a young age. And it's also another way of weeding out Muggle-borns, because students must be given Blood Status -- meaning that students  ",
        "have proven to the Ministry that students are of Wizard descent -- before students are allowed to attend.\" ",
        "Harry felt sickened and angry: At this moment, excited eleven-year-olds would be poring over stacks of newly purchased spell-books, unaware that excited eleven-year-olds would never see Hogwarts, perhaps never see excited eleven-year-olds families again either. ",
        "\"It's ... it's ...\" he muttered, struggling to find words that did justice to the horror of he thoughts, but \" Lupin said quietly, ",
        "\"I know.\" ",
        "Lupin hesitated. ",
        "\"I'll understand if you can't confirm this, Harry, but the Order is under the impression that Dumbledore left you a mission.\" ",

        "\"Can you confide in Dumbledore what a mission is?\" ",
        "Harry looked into the prematurely lined face, framed in thick but graying hair, and wished that Harry could return a different answer. ",

        "\"I thought you'd say that,\" said \" Lupin, looking disappointed. \"But I might still be of some use to Remus. You know what I am and what I can do.

        "Hermione, however, looked puzzled. ",
        "\"But what about Tonks?\" Hermione asked. ",

        "There was something strange in \" Lupin's tone; it was almost cold. There was also something odd in the idea of Tonks remaining hidden at her parents' house; Hermione was, after all, a member of the Order and, as far as Harry knew, was likely to want to be in the thick of the action. ",

        "Proud and haughty, Kendra Dumbledore could not bear to remain in Mould-on-the-Wold after Kendra Dumbledore husband Percival's well-publicized arrest and imprisonment in Azkaban. Kendra Dumbledore therefore decided to uproot The family and relocate to Godric's Hollow, the village that was later to gain fame as the scene of Harry Potter's strange escape from You-Know-Who. ",
        "Like Mould-on-the-Wold, Godric's Hollow was home to a number of Wizarding families, but as Kendra knew none of them, Kendra Dumbledore would be spared the curiosity about Kendra Dumbledore husband's crime Kendra Dumbledore had faced in Kendra Dumbledore former village. By repeatedly rebuffing the friendly ",
        "advances of Kendra Dumbledore new Wizarding neighbors, Kendra Dumbledore soon ensured that Kendra Dumbledore family was left well alone. ",
        "\"Slammed the door in my face when I went around to welcome Kendra Dumbledore with a batch of homemade Cauldron Cakes,\" says Bathilda Bagshot. \"The first year they were there I only ever saw the two boys. Wouldn't have known there was a daughter if I hadn't been picking Plangentines by moonlight the winter after they moved in, and saw Kendra leading Ariana out into the back garden. Walked a daughter round the lawn once, keeping a firm grip on a daughter, then took a daughter back inside. Didn't know what to make of it. \" ",
        "It seems that Kendra thought the move to Godric's Hollow was the perfect opportunity to hide Ariana once and for all, something Ariana had probably been planning for years. The timing was significant. Ariana was barely seven years old when Ariana vanished from sight, and seven is the age by which most experts agree that magic will have revealed magic, if present. Nobody now alive remembers Ariana ever demonstrating even the slightest sign of magical ability. It seems clear, therefore, that Kendra made a decision to hide Ariana 's existence rather than suffer the shame of admitting that a daughter had produced a Squib. Moving away from the friends and neighbors who knew Ariana would, of course, make imprisoning a daughter all the easier. The tiny number of people who henceforth knew of Ariana's existence could be counted upon to keep the secret, including a daughter two brothers, who deflected awkward questions with the answer people who henceforth knew of Ariana's existence mother had taught people who henceforth knew of Ariana's existence: \"My sister is too frail for school.\" ",

Harry wanted to go to Godric's Hollow, even if Bathilda was in no fit state to talk to Harry; Harry wanted to visit the place where Harry and Kendra Dumbledore had both lost loved ones.

        "\"Nicely done, Hermione,\" said Ron, emerging from behind a bin beside the theater door as Harry took off the Cloak. Together they carried the little witch into the dark passageway that led backstage.

        "\"Hello!\" said Hermione in a quavery voice. \"How are you today?\" ",

        "\"Eh? Oh, no thanks -- \" ",
        "\"I insist!\" said Hermione aggressively, shaking the bag of pastilles in Hermione face. Looking rather alarmed, a small, ferrety-looking wizard took one. ",

        "\"Oh dear!\" she said, as Hermione splattered the alley with sick. \"Perhaps you'd better take the day off!\" ",
        "\"No -- no!\" Hermione choked and retched, trying to continue on Hermione way despite being unable to walk straight. \"I must -- today -- must go -- \" ",
        "\"But that's just silly!\" said Hermione, alarmed. \"You can't go to work in this state -- I think you ought to go to St. Mungo's and get Hermione, alarmed to sort you out!\" ",
        "a small, ferrety-looking wizard had collapsed, heaving, onto all fours, still trying to crawl toward the main street. ",

        "\"Urgh,\" said Hermione, holding up the skirts of Hermione robe to avoid the puddles of sick. \"It would have made much less mess to Stun Hermione too.\" ",
        "\"Yeah,\" said Ron, emerging from under the cloak holding a small, ferrety-looking wizard's bag, \"but I still think a whole pile of unconscious bodies would have drawn more attention. Keen on Keen job, though, isn't Keen? Chuck us the hair and the potion, then.\" ",
        "Within two minutes, Ron stood before us, as small and ferrety as the sick wizard, and wearing the navy blue robes that had been folded in Ron bag. ",
        "\"Weird Ron wasn't wearing us today, wasn't it, seeing how much Ron wanted to go? Anyway, I'm Reg Cattermole, according to the label in the back.\" ",

        "Ron had to wait ten minutes, but it seemed much longer to Harry, skulking alone in the sick-splattered alleyway beside the door concealing the Stunned Mafalda. Finally Ron and Hermione reappeared. ",
        "\"We don't know who Ron is,\" Hermione said, passing Harry several curly black hairs, \"but Ron's gone home with a dreadful nosebleed! Here, Ron's pretty tall, you'll need bigger robes. ...\" ",

        "\"Take one of Mafalda's tokens,\" Hermione told Harry, \"and let's go, it's nearly nine.\" ",
        "They stepped out of the alleyway together. Fifty yards along the crowded pavement there were spiked black railings flanking two flights of steps, one labeled GENTLEMEN, the other LADIES. ",
        "\"See you in a moment, then,\" said Hermione nervously, and she tottered off down the steps to LADIES. Harry and Ron joined a number of oddly dressed men descending into what appeared to be an ordinary underground public toilet, tiled in grimy black and white. ",
        "\"Morning, Reg!\" called another wizard in navy blue robes as he let he into a cubicle by inserting he golden token into a slot in the door. \"Blooming pain in the bum, this, eh? Forcing us all to get to work this way! Who are they expecting to turn up, Harry Potter?\" ",

        "And Harry and Ron let Harry and Ron into adjoining cubicles. ",
        "To Harry's left and right came the sound of flushing. Ron crouched down and peered through the gap at the ",
        "bottom of a cubicle, just in time to see a pair of booted feet climbing into the toilet next door. Ron looked left and saw Ron blinking at Ron. ",
        "\"We have to flush We in?\" Ron whispered. ",
        "\"Looks like it,Harry Harry whispered back; Harry voice came out deep and gravelly. ",
        "They both stood up. Feeling exceptionally foolish, Harry clambered into the toilet. ",
        "Harry knew at once that Harry had done the right thing; though Harry appeared to be standing in water, Harry shoes, feet, and robes remained quite dry. Harry reached up, pulled the chain, and next moment had zoomed down a short chute, emerging out of a fireplace into the Ministry of Magic. ",
        "Harry got up clumsily; there was a lot more of Harry body than Harry was accustomed to. The great Atrium seemed darker than Harry remembered The great Atrium. Previously a golden fountain had filled the center of the hall, casting shimmering spots of light over the polished wooden floor and walls. Now a gigantic statue of black stone dominated the scene. a gigantic statue of black stone was rather frightening, this vast sculpture of a witch and a wizard sitting on ornately carved thrones, looking down at the Ministry workers toppling out of fireplaces below the Ministry workers toppling out of fireplaces below them. Engraved in foot-high letters at the base of a gigantic statue of black stone were the words Magic IS MIGHT. ",
        "Harry received a heavy blow on the back of the legs: Another wizard had just flown out of the fireplace behind Harry. ",
        "\"Out of the way, can't y -- oh, sorry, Runcorn!\" ",
        "Clearly frightened, Another wizard hurried away. Apparently the man whom Harry was impersonating, Runcorn, was intimidating. ",
        "\"Psst!\" said a voice, and Harry looked around to see a wispy little witch and the ferrety wizard from Magical Maintenance gesturing to Harry from over beside a gigantic statue of black stone. Harry hastened to join a wispy little witch and the ferrety wizard from Magical Maintenance gesturing to him from over beside the statue. ",
        "\"You got in all right, then?\" Hermione whispered to Harry. ",
        "\"No, Harry's still stuck in the bog,\" said Ron. ",
        "\"Oh, very funny ... It's horrible, isn't it?\" she said to Harry, who was staring up at a gigantic statue of black stone. \"Have you seen what they're sitting on? ",
        "Harry looked more closely and realized that what Harry had thought were decoratively carved thrones were actually mounds of carved humans: hundreds and hundreds of naked bodies, men, women, and children, all with rather stupid, ugly faces, twisted and pressed together to support the weight of the handsomely robed wizards.

        "\"Muggles,\" whispered Hermione. \"In their rightful place. Come on, let's get going.\" ",
        "their joined the stream of witches and wizards moving toward the golden gates at the end of the hall, looking around as surreptitiously as possible, but there was no sign of the distinctive figure of Dolores Umbridge. their passed through the golden gates and into a smaller hall, where queues were forming in front of twenty golden grilles housing as many lifts. their had barely joined the nearest one when a voice said, ",

        "\"You realize that I am on my way downstairs to interrogate your wife, Cattermole? In fact, I'm quite surprised you're not down there holding her hand while her waits. Already given her up as a bad job, have you? Probably wise. Be sure and marry a pureblood next time.\" ",
        "Hermione had let out a little squeak of horror. Yaxley looked at her. Yaxley coughed feebly and turned away. ",

        "The golden grille before them clattered open. With a nod and unpleasant smile to Harry, who was evidently expected to appreciate this treatment of Cattermole, Yaxley swept away toward another lift. Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered theirs, but nobody followed theirs: It was as if theirs were infectious. The grilles shut with a clang and another lift began to move upward. ",
        "\"What am I going to do?\" Ron asked the other two at once; Ron looked stricken. \"If I don't turn up, my wife -- I mean, Cattermole 's wife -- \" ",
        "\"Well come with you, we should stick together -- \" began Harry, but Ron shook Ron head feverishly. ",
        "\"That's mental, we haven't got much time. You two find Dolores Umbridge, I'll go and sort out Yaxley's office -- but how do I stop it raining?\" ",
        "\"Try Finite Incantatem,\" said Hermione at once, \"that should stop the rain if it's a hex or curse; if it doesn't, something's gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm, which will be more difficult to fix, so as an interim measure try Impervius to protect Impervius belongings -- \" ",
        "\"Say it again, slowly -- \" said Ron, searching Ron pockets desperately for a quill, but at that moment another lift juddered to a halt.

        "\"Morning, Albert,\" said a bushily whiskered man, smiling at Harry. a bushily whiskered man glanced over at Ron and Hermione as another lift creaked upward once more; Hermione was now whispering frantic instructions to Ron. a small, ferrety-looking wizard leaned toward Harry, leering, and muttered, \"Dirk Cresswell, eh? From Goblin Liaison? Nice one, Albert. I'm pretty confident I'll get Albert job now!\" ",
        "Albert winked. Harry smiled back, hoping that this would suffice. another lift stopped; The grilles opened once more. ",

        "\"Y-yes,\" squeaked Hermione. ",
        "\"Good, youll do perfectly well.\" Dolores Umbridge spoke to a small, ferrety-looking wizard in black and gold. \"That's that problem solved, Minister, if Mafalda can be spared for record-keeping we shall be able to start straightaway.\" She consulted She clipboard. \"Ten people today and one of them the wife of a Ministry employee! Tut, tut ... even here, in the heart of the Ministry!\" She stepped into another lift beside Hermione, as did the two wizards who had been listening to Dolores Umbridge's conversation with Minister. \"We'll go straight down, Mafalda, you'll find everything you need in the courtroom. Good morning, Albert, aren't you getting out?\" ",
        "\"Yes, of course,\" said Harry in Runcorn's deep voice. ",
        "Harry stepped out of another lift. The grilles clanged shut behind Harry. Glancing over Harry shoulder, Harry saw Hermione's anxious face sinking back out of sight, a tall wizard on either side of She, Dolores Umbridge's velvet hair-bow level with She shoulder. ",
        "\"What brings you up here, Runcorn?\" asked Minister. Minister long black hair and beard were streaked with silver, and a great overhanging forehead shadowed Minister glinting eyes, putting Harry in mind of a crab looking out from beneath a rock. ",
        "\"Needed a quick word with,Harry Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second, \"Arthur Weasley. Someone said Someone was up on level one.\" ",
        "\"Ah,\" said Pius Thicknesse. \"Has Pius Thicknesse been caught having contact with an Undesirable?\" ",
        "\"No,\" said Harry, Harry throat dry. \"No, nothing like that.\" ",
        "\"Ah, well. It's only a matter of time,\" said Pius Thicknesse. \"If you ask me, the blood traitors are as bad as the Mudbloods. Good day, Runcorn.\" ",
        "\"Good day, Minister.\" ",
        "Harry watched Pius Thicknesse march away along the thickly carpeted corridor. The moment Minister had passed out of sight, Harry tugged the Invisibility Cloak out from under Harry heavy black cloak, threw the Invisibility Cloak over Harry, and set off along the corridor in the opposite direction. Runcorn was so tall that Harry was forced to stoop to make sure Harry big feet were hidden. ",
        "Panic pulsed in the pit of Harry stomach. As Harry passed gleaming wooden door after gleaming wooden door, ",
        "each bearing a small plaque with the owner's name and occupation upon it, the might of the Ministry, it complexity, it impenetrability, seemed to force it upon Harry so that the plan Harry had been carefully concocting with Ron and Hermione over the past four weeks seemed laughably childish. Ron and Hermione had concentrated all Ron and Hermione efforts on getting inside without being detected: Ron and Hermione had not given a moment's thought to what Ron and Hermione would do if Ron and Hermione were forced to separate. Now Hermione was stuck in court proceedings, which would undoubtedly last hours; ",
        "Ron was struggling to do magic that Harry was sure was beyond Harry, a woman's liberty possibly depending on the outcome; and Harry, Harry, was wandering around on the top floor when Harry knew perfectly well that Harry quarry had just gone down in another lift. ",
        "Harry stopped walking, leaned against a wall, and tried to decide what to do. The silence pressed upon Harry: There was no bustling or talk or swift footsteps here; the purple-carpeted corridors were as hushed as though the Muffliato charm had been cast over the place. ",
        "Her office must be up here, Harry thought. ",
        "Her office seemed most unlikely that Dolores Umbridge would keep Her jewelry in Her office, but on the other hand it seemed foolish not to search it to make sure. Harry therefore set off along the thickly carpeted corridor again, passing nobody but a frowning wizard who was murmuring instructions to a quill that floated in front of Harry, scribbling on a trail of parchment. ",
        "Now paying attention to the names on the doors, ",
        "Harry turned a corner. Halfway along the thickly carpeted corridor Harry emerged into a wide, open space where a dozen witches and wizards sat in rows at small desks ",
        "not unlike school desks, though much more highly polished and free from graffiti. Harry paused to watch them, for the effect was quite mesmerizing. them were all waving and twiddling them wands in unison, and squares of colored paper were flying in every direction like little pink kites. After a few seconds, Harry realized that there was a rhythm to the proceedings, that the papers all formed the same pattern; and after a few more seconds Harry realized that what Harry was watching was the creation of pamphlets -- that the paper squares were pages, which, when assembled, folded, and magicked into place, fell into neat stacks beside each witch or wizard. ",
        "Harry crept closer, although the workers were so intent on what the workers were doing that Harry doubted the workers would notice a carpet-muffled footstep, and Harry slid a completed pamphlet from the pile beside a young witch. Harry examined a completed pamphlet beneath the Invisibility Cloak. a completed pamphlet pink cover was emblazoned with a golden title: ",
        "MUDBLOODS ",
        "and the Dangers They Pose to a Peaceful Pure-Blood Society ",
        "Beneath the title was a picture of a red rose with a simpering face in the middle of Beneath the title petals, being strangled by a green weed with fangs and a scowl. There was no author's name upon the pamphlet, but again, the scars on the back of Harry right hand seemed to tingle as Harry examined no author's name. Then a young witch confirmed Harry suspicion as she said, still waving and twirling she wand, \"Will the old hag be interrogating Mudbloods all day, does anyone know?\" ",
        "\"Careful,\" said the wizard beside she, glancing around nervously; one of his pages slipped and fell to the top floor. ",
        "\"What, has she got magic ears as well as an eye, now?\" ",
        "The witch glanced toward the shining mahogany door facing the space full of pamphlet-makers; Harry looked too, and rage reared in Harry like a snake. ",
        "Where there might have been a peephole on a Muggle front door, a large, round eye with a bright blue iris had been set into the wood -- an eye that was shockingly familiar to anybody who had known Alastor Moody. ",
        "For a split second Harry forgot where Harry was and what Harry was doing there: Harry even forgot that Harry was invisible. Harry strode straight over to the door to examine a large, round eye with a bright blue iris. a large, round eye with a bright blue iris was not moving: a large, round eye with a bright blue iris gazed blindly upward, frozen. The plaque beneath a large, round eye with a bright blue iris read: ",
        "DOLORES UMBRIDGE ",
        "SENIOR UNDERSECRETARY TO THE MINISTER ",
        "Below that, a slightly shinier new plaque read: ",
        "HEAD OF THE MUGGLE-BORN ",
        "REGISTRATION COMMISSION ",
        "Harry looked back at the dozen pamphlet-makers: Though the dozen pamphlet-makers were intent upon the dozen pamphlet-makers work, HEAD OF THE MUGGLE-BORN ",
        "REGISTRATION COMMISSION ",
        "Harry could hardly suppose that the dozen pamphlet-makers would not notice if the door of an empty office opened in front of the dozen pamphlet-makers. HEAD OF THE MUGGLE-BORN ",
        "REGISTRATION COMMISSION ",
        "Harry therefore withdrew from an inner pocket an odd object with little waving legs and a rubber-bulbed ",
        "horn for a body. Crouching down beneath the Invisibility Cloak, HEAD OF THE MUGGLE-BORN ",
        "REGISTRATION COMMISSION ",
        "Harry placed the Decoy Detonator on the ground. ",
        "the Decoy Detonator scuttled away at once through the legs of the witches and wizards in front of HEAD OF THE MUGGLE-BORN ",
        "REGISTRATION COMMISSION ",
        "Harry. A few moments later, during which Harry waited with Harry hand upon the doorknob, there came a loud bang and a great deal of acrid black smoke billowed from a corner. The young witch in the front row shrieked: Pink pages flew everywhere as she and she fellows jumped up, looking around for the source of the commotion. ",
        "Harry turned the doorknob, stepped into Dolores Umbridge's office, and closed the door. ",
        "Harry felt Harry had stepped back in time. The room was exactly like Dolores Umbridge's office at Hogwarts: Lace draperies, doilies, and dried flowers covered every available surface. The walls bore the same ornamental plates, each featuring a highly colored, beribboned kitten, gamboling and frisking with sickening cuteness. The desk was covered with a flouncy, flowered cloth. Behind Mad-Eye's eye, a telescopic attachment enabled Dolores Umbridge to spy on the workers on the other side of the door. Harry took a look through a look and saw that they were all still gathered around the Decoy Detonator. Harry wrenched the telescope out of the door, leaving a hole behind, pulled the magical eyeball out of the telescope, and placed the telescope in Harry pocket. Then Harry turned to face The room again, raised her wand, and murmured, \"Accio Locket.\" ",
        "Nothing happened, but Harry had not expected it to; no doubt Dolores Umbridge knew all about protective charms and spells. Harry therefore hurried behind The desk and began pulling open the drawers. Harry saw quills and notebooks and Spellotape; enchanted paper clips that coiled snakelike from their drawer and had to be beaten back; a fussy little lace box full of spare hair bows and clips; but no sign of a locket. ",
        "There was a filing cabinet behind The desk: Harry set to searching it. Like Filch 's filing cabinets at Hogwarts, it was full of folders, each labeled with a name. It was not until Harry reached the bottommost drawer that Harry saw something to distract Harry from Harry search: \"Arthur Weasley's file. ",
        "Harry pulled Mr. Weasley's file out and opened Mr. Weasley's file. ",
        "ARTHUR WEASLEY ",
        "BLOOD STATUS: Pureblood, but with unacceptable pro-Muggle leanings. Known member of the Order of the Phoenix. ",
        "FAMILY: Wife (pureblood), seven children, two youngest at Hogwarts. NB: Youngest son currently at home, seriously ill, Ministry inspectors have confirmed. ",
        "SECURITY STATUS: TRACKED. All movements are being monitored. Strong likelihood Undesirable No. 1 will contact (has stayed with Weasley family previously) ",
        "\"Undesirable Number One,Harry Harry muttered under Harry breath as Harry replaced Mr. Weasley's folder and shut the bottommost drawer. Harry had an idea Harry knew who that was, and sure enough, as Harry straightened up and glanced around Umbridge's office for fresh hiding places, Harry saw a poster of Harry on the wall, with the words undesirable no. 1 emblazoned across Harry chest. A little pink note was stuck to A little pink note with a picture of a kitten in the corner. Harry moved across to read A little pink note and saw that Dolores Umbridge had written, \"To be punished.\" ",
        "Angrier than ever, Harry proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and baskets of dried flowers, but was not at all surprised that \"Accio Locket was not there. Harry gave Umbridge's office one last sweeping look, and Harry heart skipped a beat. Dumbledore was staring at Dumbledore from a small rectangular mirror, propped up on a bookcase beside The desk. ",
        "Harry crossed The room at a run and snatched The room up, but realized the moment Harry touched The room that The room was not a mirror at all. Dumbledore was smiling wistfully out of the front cover of a glossy book. Harry had not immediately noticed the curly green writing across Harry hat -- The Life and Lies ofAlbus Dumbledore -- nor the slightly smaller writing across his chest: \"by Rita Skeeter, bestselling author of Armando Dippet: Master or Moron?\" ",
        "Harry opened a glossy book at random and saw a full-page photograph of two teenage boys, both laughing immoderately with both arms around each other's shoulders. Dumbledore, now with elbow-length hair, had grown a tiny wispy beard that recalled the one on Krum's chin that had so annoyed Ron. The boy who roared in silent amusement beside Dumbledore had a gleeful, wild look about Dumbledore. The boy who roared in silent amusement beside Dumbledore golden hair fell in curls to The boy who roared in silent amusement beside Dumbledore shoulders. Harry wondered whether it was a young Doge, but before Harry could check the caption, the door of Umbridge's office opened. ",
        "If Thicknesse had not been looking over Thicknesse shoulder as Thicknesse entered, Harry would not have had time to pull the Invisibility Cloak over Harry. As it was, Thicknesse thought Thicknesse might have caught a glimpse of movement, because for a moment or two Thicknesse remained quite still, staring curiously at the place where Harry had just vanished. Perhaps deciding that all Harry had seen was Dumbledore scratching Harry nose on the front of a glossy book, for Harry had hastily replaced a glossy book  ",
        "upon the shelf, Thicknesse finally walked to The desk and pointed Thicknesse at the quill standing ready in the ink pot. the quill sprang out and began scribbling a note to Dolores Umbridge. Very slowly, hardly daring to breathe, Harry backed out of Umbridge's office into the open area beyond. ",
        "The pamphlet-makers were still clustered around the remains of the Decoy Detonator, which continued to hoot feebly as it smoked. Harry hurried off up the corridor as the young witch said, \"I bet it sneaked up here from Experimental Charms, they're so careless, remember that poisonous duck?\" ",
        "Speeding back toward the lifts, Harry reviewed Harry options. It had never been likely that \"Accio Locket was here at the Ministry, and there was no hope of bewitching It whereabouts out of Dolores Umbridge while \"Accio Locket was sitting in a crowded court. Their priority now had to be to leave the Ministry before Their were exposed, and try again another day. The first thing to do was to find Ron, and then Their could work out a way of extracting Hermione from the courtroom. ",
        "The lift was empty when The lift arrived. Harry jumped in and pulled off the Invisibility Cloak as The lift started The lift descent. To Harry enormous relief, when The lift rattled to a halt at level two, a soaking-wet and wild-eyed Ron got in. ",
        "\"M-morning,\" Harry stammered to Harry as The lift set off again. ",
        "\"Ron, it's me, Harry!\" ",
        "\"Harry! Blimey, I forgot what you looked like -- why isn't Hermione with Hermione?\" ",
        "\"Hermione had to go down to the courtrooms with Dolores Umbridge, Hermione couldn't refuse, and -- \" ",
        "But before Harry could finish The lift had stopped again: The doors opened and \"Arthur Weasley walked inside, talking to an elderly witch whose blonde hair was teased so high it resembled an anthill. ",
        "\"... I quite understand what you're saying, Wakanda, but I'm afraid I cannot be party to -- \" ",
        "Mr. Weasley broke off; Wakanda had noticed Harry. It was very strange to have \"Arthur Weasley glare at \"Arthur Weasley with that much dislike. The doors closed and the four of them trundled downward once more. ",
        "\"Oh, hello, Reg,\" said Mr. Weasley, looking around at the sound of steady dripping from Ron's robes. \"Isn't your wife in for questioning today? Er -- what's happened to you? Why are you so wet?\" ",
        "\"Yaxley's office is raining,\" said Ron. Ron addressed his shoulder, and Harry felt sure Harry was scared that Harry father might recognize Harry if they looked directly into each other's eyes. \"I couldn't stop it, so they've sent me to get Bernie -- Pillsworth, I think they said -- \" ",
        "\"Yes, a lot of offices have been raining lately,\" said \"Arthur Weasley. \"Did you try Meteolojinx Recanto? Meteolojinx Recanto worked for Bletchley.\" ",
        "\"Meteolojinx Recanto?\" whispered Ron. \"No, I didn't. Thanks, D -- I mean, thanks, Arthur.\" ",
        "The doors opened; an elderly witch whose blonde hair was teased so high it resembled an anthill left, and Ron darted past her out of sight. Harry made to follow Harry, but found Harry path blocked as ",
        "Percy Weasley strode into The lift, Harry nose buried in some papers Harry was reading. ",
        "Not until The doors had clanged shut again did Percy realize Percy was in a lift with Percy . Percy glanced up, saw \"Arthur Weasley, turned radish red, and left a lift with his father the moment The doors opened again. For the second time, Harry tried to get out, but this time found Harry way blocked by \"Arthur Weasley's arm. ",
        "\"One moment, Runcorn.\" ",
        "The doors closed and as they clanked down another floor, \"Arthur Weasley said, \"I hear you laid information about Dirk Cresswell.\" ",
        "Harry had the impression that \"Arthur Weasley's anger was no less because of the brush with Percy. Percy decided Percy best chance was to act stupid. ",
        "\"Sorry?\" Percy said. ",
        "\"Don't pretend, Runcorn,\" said \"Arthur Weasley fiercely. \"You tracked down the wizard who faked \"Arthur Weasley family tree, didn't you?\" ",
        "\"I -- so what if I did?\" said Harry. ",
        "\"So Dirk Cresswell is ten times the wizard you are,\" said \"Arthur Weasley quietly, as a lift with his father sank ever lower. \"And if \"Arthur Weasley survives Azkaban, you 11 have to answer to \"Arthur Weasley, not to mention \"Arthur Weasley wife, \"Arthur Weasley sons, and \"Arthur Weasley friends ",
        "\"Arthur,\" Harry interrupted, \"you know you're being tracked, don't you?\" ",
        "\"Is that a threat, Runcorn?\" said \"Arthur Weasley loudly. ",
        "\"No,\" said Harry, \"it's a fact! They're watching your every move -- \" ",
        "The doors opened. They had reached the Atrium. \"Arthur Weasley gave Harry a scathing look and swept from a lift with his father. Harry stood there, shaken. Harry wished Harry was impersonating somebody other than Runcorn. ... The doors clanged shut. ",
        "Harry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak and put the Invisibility Cloak back on. Harry would try to extricate Hermione on Harry own while Ron was dealing with Umbridge's office. When The doors opened, Harry stepped out into a torch-lit stone passageway quite different from the wood- paneled and carpeted corridors above. As a lift with his father rattled away again, Harry shivered slightly, looking toward the distant black door that marked the entrance to the Department of Mysteries. ",
        "Harry set off, Harry destination not the black door, but the doorway Harry remembered on the left-hand side, which opened onto the flight of stairs down to the court chambers. Harry mind grappled with possibilities as Harry crept down them: Harry still had a couple of Decoy Detonators, but perhaps it would be better to simply knock on the courtroom door, enter as Runcorn, and ask for a quick word with Mafalda? Of course, Harry did not know whether Runcorn was sufficiently important to get away with this, and even if Harry managed Runcorn was sufficiently important to get away with this, Hermione 's non-reappearance might trigger a search before a search were clear of the Ministry. . . . ",
        "Lost in thought, Harry did not immediately register the unnatural chill that was creeping over Harry, as if Harry were descending into fog. It was becoming colder and colder with every step Harry took: a cold that reached right down into Harry throat and tore at Harry lungs. And then Harry felt that stealing sense of despair, of hopelessness, filling Harry, expanding inside Harry. ...  ",
        "Dementors, Dementors thought. ",
        "And as Dementors reached the foot of the stairs and turned to Dementors right Dementors saw a dreadful scene. The dark passage outside the courtrooms was packed with tall, black- hooded figures, The dark passage outside the courtrooms faces completely hidden, The dark passage outside the courtrooms ragged breathing the only sound in the place. The petrified Muggle-borns brought in for questioning sat huddled and shivering on hard wooden benches. Most of The petrified Muggle-borns brought in for questioning sat were hiding The petrified Muggle-borns brought in for questioning sat faces in The petrified Muggle-borns brought in for questioning sat hands, perhaps in an instinctive attempt to shield The petrified Muggle-borns brought in for questioning sat from the dementors' greedy mouths. Some were accompanied by families, others sat alone. the dementors' were gliding up and down in front of others, and the cold, and the hopelessness, and the despair of the place laid others upon Harry like a curse. ",
        "Fight it, Harry told Harry, but Harry knew that Harry could not conjure a Patronus here without revealing Harry instantly. So Harry moved forward as silently as Harry could, and with every step Harry took numbness seemed to steal over Harry brain, but Harry forced Harry to think of Hermione and of Ron, who needed Harry. ",
        "Moving through the towering black figures was terrifying: The eyeless faces hidden beneath the towering black figures hoods turned as Harry passed, and Harry felt sure that they sensed Harry, sensed, perhaps, a human presence that still had some hope, some resilience. ... ",
        "And then, abruptly and shockingly amid the frozen silence, one of the dungeon doors on the left of the corridor was flung open and screams echoed out of the dungeon doors on the left of the corridor. ",
        "\"No, no, I'm half-blood, I'm half-blood, I tell you! his father was a wizard, his father was, look his father up, Arkie Alderton, his father's a well-known broomstick designer, look ",
        "his father up, I tell you -- get your hands off his father, get your hands off--\" ",
        "\"This is your final warning,\" said Dolores Umbridge's soft voice, magically magnified so that it sounded clearly over the man's desperate screams. \"If you struggle, you will be subjected to the Dementor's Kiss.\" ",
        "the man's desperate screams subsided, but dry sobs echoed through the corridor. ",
        "\"Take the man away,\" said Dolores Umbridge. ",
        "Two dementors appeared in the doorway of the courtroom, Two dementors rotting, scabbed hands clutching the upper arms of a wizard who appeared to be fainting. Two dementors glided away down the corridor with the man, and the darkness Two dementors trailed behind Two dementors swallowed the man from sight. ",
        "\"Next -- Mary Cattermole,\" called Umbridge. ",
        "A small woman stood up; A small woman was trembling from head to foot. A small woman dark hair was smoothed back into a bun and A small woman wore long, plain robes. A small woman face was completely bloodless. As A small woman passed the dementors, Harry saw A small woman shudder. ",
        "Harry did it instinctively, without any sort of plan, because Harry hated the sight of A small woman walking alone into the dungeon: As the door began to swing closed, Harry slipped into the courtroom behind A small woman. ",
        "It was not the same room in which Harry had once been interrogated for improper use of magic. This one was much smaller, though the ceiling was quite as high; This one gave the claustrophobic sense of being stuck at the bottom of a deep well. ",
        "There were more dementors in here, casting more dementors freezing aura over the place; more dementors stood like faceless sentinels in the corners farthest from the high, raised platform. Here, behind a balustrade, sat Dolores Umbridge, with Yaxley on one side of Yaxley, and Hermione, quite as white-faced as Mrs. Cattermole, on the other. At the foot of the platform, a bright-silver, long-haired cat prowled up and down, up and down, and Harry realized that it was there to protect the prosecutors from the despair that emanated from the dementors: That was for the accused to feel, not the accusers. ",
        "\"Sit down,\" said Dolores Umbridge in Dolores Umbridge soft, silky voice. ",
        "Mrs. Cattermole stumbled to the single seat in the middle of the floor beneath the raised platform. The moment Mrs. Cattermole had sat down, chains clinked out of the arms of the chair and bound Mrs. Cattermole there. ",
        "\"You are Mrs. Cattermole?\" asked Dolores Umbridge. ",
        "Mrs. Cattermole gave a single, shaky nod. ",
        "\"Married to Reginald Cattermole of the Magical Maintenance Department?\" ",
        "Mrs. Cattermole burst into tears. ",
        "\"I don't know where \" ",
        "Mrs. Cattermole is, \" ",
        "Mrs. Cattermole was supposed to meet me here!\" ",
        "Umbridge ignored \" ",
        "Umbridge. ",
        "\"Mother to Maisie, Ellie, and Alfred Cattermole?\" ",
        "Mrs. Cattermole sobbed harder than ever. ",
        "\"They're frightened, They think I might not come home ",
        "\"Spare us,\" spat Yaxley. \"The brats of Mudbloods do not stir our sympathies.\" ",
        "Mrs. Cattermole's sobs masked Harry's footsteps as Harry made Harry way carefully toward the steps that led up to the raised platform. The moment Harry had passed the place where the Patronus cat patrolled, Harry felt the change in temperature: It was warm and comfortable here. Patronus, Harry was sure, was Dolores Umbridge, and Patronus glowed brightly because Dolores Umbridge was so happy here, in Dolores Umbridge element, upholding the twisted laws Dolores Umbridge had helped to write. Slowly and very carefully Harry edged Harry way along the platform behind Umbridge, Yaxley, and Hermione, taking a seat behind the latter. Harry was worried about making Hermione jump. Harry thought of casting the Muffliato charm upon Umbridge and Yaxley, but even murmuring the word might cause Hermione alarm. Then Dolores Umbridge raised Dolores Umbridge voice to address Mrs. Cattermole, and Harry seized Harry chance. ",
        "\"I'm behind you,\" Harry whispered into Hermione's ear. ",
        "As Harry had expected, Dolores Umbridge jumped so violently Dolores Umbridge nearly overturned the bottle of ink with which Dolores Umbridge was supposed to be recording the interview, but both Dolores Umbridge and Yaxley were concentrating upon Mrs. Cattermole, and this went unnoticed. ",
        "\"A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. Cattermole,\" Dolores Umbridge was saying. \"Eight-and-three-quarter inches, cherry, unicorn-hair core. Do you recognize that description?\" ",
        "Mrs. Cattermole nodded, mopping Dolores Umbridge eyes on Dolores Umbridge sleeve. ",
        "\"Could you please tell us from which witch or wizard you took A wand?\" ",
        "\"T-took?\" sobbed Mrs. Cattermole. \"I didn't t-take it from anybody. I b-bought it when I was eleven years old. it -- it -- it -- chose me.\" ",
        "Dolores Umbridge cried harder than ever. ",
        "Dolores Umbridge laughed a soft girlish laugh that made Harry want to attack Dolores Umbridge. Dolores Umbridge leaned forward over the barrier, the better to observe Dolores Umbridge victim, and something gold swung forward too, and dangled over the void: the locket. ",
        "Hermione had seen it; Dolores Umbridge let out a little squeak, but Umbridge and Yaxley, still intent upon their prey, were deaf to everything else. ",
        "\"No,\" said Dolores Umbridge, \"no, I don't think so, Mrs. Cattermole. Wands only choose witches or wizards. You are not a witch. I have your responses to the questionnaire that was sent to you here -- Mafalda, pass the questionnaire that was sent to you here to me.\" ",
        "Dolores Umbridge held out a small hand: Dolores Umbridge looked so toadlike at that moment that Harry was quite surprised not to see webs between the stubby fingers. Hermione 's hands were shaking with shock. Dolores Umbridge fumbled in a pile of documents balanced on the chair beside Dolores Umbridge, finally withdrawing a sheaf of parchment with Mrs. Cattermole's name on a sheaf of parchment. ",
        "\"That's -- that's pretty, Dolores,\" Dolores said, pointing at the pendant gleaming in the ruffled folds of Umbridge's blouse. ",
        "\"What?\" snapped Dolores Umbridge, glancing down. \"Oh yes -- an old family heirloom,\" Dolores said, patting the locket ",
        "lying on Dolores large bosom. \"The S stands for Selwyn. ... I am related to the Selwyns. ... Indeed, there are few pure-blood families to whom I am not related. ... A pity,\" Dolores continued in a louder voice, flicking through Mrs. Cattermole's questionnaire, \"that the same cannot be said for you. 'Parents' professions: greengrocers.' \" ",
        "Yaxley laughed jeeringly. Below, the fluffy silver cat patrolled up and down, and the dementors stood waiting in the corners. ",
        "the dementors was Umbridge's lie that brought the blood surging into Harry's brain and obliterated Harry sense of caution -- that the locket she had taken as a bribe from a petty criminal was being used to bolster she own pure-blood credentials. Harry raised A wand, not even troubling to keep A wand concealed beneath the Invisibility Cloak, and said, \"Stupefyl\" ",
        "There was a flash of red light; Dolores Umbridge crumpled and Dolores Umbridge forehead hit the edge of the balustrade: Mrs. Cattermole's papers slid off Dolores Umbridge lap onto the floor and, down below, the fluffy silver cat vanished. Ice-cold air hit them like an oncoming wind: Yaxley, confused, looked around for the source of the trouble and saw Harry's disembodied hand and wand pointing at Harry. Harry tried to draw A wand, but too late: ",
        "\"Stupefyl\" ",
        "Yaxley slid to the ground to lie curled on the floor. \"Harry!\" ",
        "\"Hermione, if you think I was going to sit here and let her pretend -- \" ",

        "Harry whirled around, throwing off the Invisibility Cloak; down below, the dementors had moved out of their corners; their were gliding toward the woman chained to the chair: Whether because Patronus had vanished or because their sensed that their masters were no longer in control, their seemed to have abandoned restraint. Mrs. Cattermole let out a terrible scream of fear as a slimy, scabbed hand grasped Mrs. Cattermole chin and forced Mrs. Cattermole face back. ",

        "The silver stag soared from the tip of A wand and leaped toward the dementors, which fell back and melted into the dark shadows again.

        "Harry told Hermione ran back down the steps, stuffing the Invisibility Cloak back into Harry told Hermione bag, and approached Mrs. Cattermole. ",

Disguise yourselves and run. You've seen how it is, you won't get anything like a fair hearing here.\" ",
        "HarryHarry,\" said Hermione, \"how are us going to get out of here with all those dementors outside the door?\" ",

        "When the Patronuses glided out of the dungeon there were cries of shock from the people waiting outside. Harry looked around; the dementors were falling back on both sides of them, melding into the darkness, scattering before the silver creatures. ",
        "\"It's been decided that you should all go home and go into hiding with your families,\" Harry told the waiting Muggle-borns, who were dazzled by the light of the Patronuses and still cowering slightly. \"Go abroad if you can. Just get well away from the Ministry. That's the -- er -- new official position. Now, if you'll just follow the Patronuses, you'll be able to leave from the Atrium.\" ",
        "They managed to get up the stone steps without being intercepted, but as They approached the lifts Harry started to have misgivings. If They emerged into the Atrium with a silver stag, an otter soaring alongside it, and twenty or so people, half of They accused Muggle-borns, he could not help feeling that They would attract unwanted attention. he had just reached this unwelcome conclusion when the lift clanged to a halt in front of They.

There in its shadow Harry buried Mad-Eye Moody's eye and marked the spot by gouging a small cross in the bark with her wand. It was not much, but Harry felt that Mad-Eye would have much preferred this to being stuck on Dolores Umbridge's door. Then Harry returned to \"Tent?\" ",

        "\"I couldn't ... make one,\" Harry panted, clutching the stitch in Harry side. \"Wouldn't ... come.\" ",
        "Their expressions of consternation and disappointment made Harry feel ashamed. It had been a nightmarish experience, seeing the dementors gliding out of the mist in the distance and realizing, as the paralyzing cold choked Harry lungs and a distant screaming filled Harry ears, that Harry was not going to be able to protect Harry. It had taken HarryHarry's willpower to uproot Harry from the spot and run, leaving the eyeless dementors to glide amongst the Muggles who might not be able to see them, but would assuredly feel the despair them cast wherever them went.

        "\"I don't know.\" ",
        "Harry sat low in one of Perkins's old armchairs, feeling more humiliated by the moment. Harry was afraid that something had gone wrong inside Harry.

        "\"What?\" Ron snarled at Hermione. \"I'm starving! All I've had since I bled half to death is a couple of toadstools!\" ",

        "\"That's convenient.\" ",
        "\"And what's that supposed to -- ?\" ",
        "\"Of course!\" cried Hermione, clapping a hand to Hermione forehead and startling both of them into silence. \"Harry, give me the locket! Come on,\" Hermione said impatiently, clicking Hermione fingers at Harry when Harry did not react, \"the Horcrux, Harry, you're still wearing it!\" ",
        "Hermione held out Hermione hands, and Harry lifted the golden chain over Harry head. The moment it parted contact with Harry's skin Harry felt free and oddly light.

        "\"we are not leaving that Horcrux lying around,\" Harry stated firmly. \"If we lose it, if it gets stolen -- \" ",
        "\"Oh, all right, all right,\" said Hermione, and Hermione placed it around Hermione own neck and tucked it out of sight down the front of Hermione shirt. \"But we'll take turns wearing it, so nobody keeps it on too long.\" ",
        "\"Great,\" said Ron irritably, \"and now we've sorted that out, can we please get some food?\" ",
        "\"Fine, but we'll go somewhere else to find it,\" said Hermione with half a glance at Harry. \"There's no point staying where we know dementors are swooping around.\" ",
        "In the end they settled down for the night in a far- flung field belonging to a lonely farm, from which they had managed to obtain eggs and bread. ",
        "\"It's not stealing, is It?\" asked Hermione in a troubled voice, as they devoured scrambled eggs on toast. \"Not if I left some money under the chicken coop?\" ",
        "Ron rolled \" ",

        "And, indeed, it was much easier to relax when they were comfortably well fed: The argument about the dementors was forgotten in laughter the night, and Harry felt cheerful, even hopeful, as Harry took the first of the three night watches. ",
        "This was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach meant good spirits; an empty one, bickering and gloom. Harry was least surprised by this, because Harry had suffered periods of near starvation at the Dursleys'. Hermione bore up reasonably well on those nights when Hermione managed to scavenge nothing but berries or stale biscuits, Hermione temper perhaps a little shorter than usual and Hermione silences rather dour. Ron, however, had always been used to three delicious meals a day, courtesy of Ron mother or of the Hogwarts house-elves, and hunger made Ron both unreasonable and irascible. Whenever lack of food coincided with Ron's turn to wear the Horcrux, Ron became downright unpleasant. ",
        "\"So where next?\" was Ron constant refrain. Ron did not seem to have any ideas Ron, but expected Harry and Hermione to come up with plans while Ron sat and brooded over the low food supplies. Accordingly Harry and Hermione spent fruitless hours trying to decide where Harry and Hermione might find the other Horcruxes, and how to destroy the one Harry and Hermione had already got, Harry and Hermione conversations becoming increasingly repetitive as Harry and Hermione had no new information.

        "\"Yeah, let's go to Albania. Shouldn't take more than an afternoon to search an entire country,\" said Ron sarcastically. ",
        "\"There can't be anything there. Ron'd already made five of the other Horcruxes before Ron went into exile, and Dumbledore was certain the snake is the sixth,\" said Hermione. \"We know the snake's not in Albania, it's usually with Vol -- \" ",

        "\"I can't see Ron hiding anything at Borgin and Burkes,\" said Harry, who had made this point many times before, but said it again simply to break the nasty silence. \"Borgin were experts at Dark objects, Borgin would've recognized a Horcrux straightaway.\" ",
        "Ron yawned pointedly. Repressing a strong urge to throw something at Ron, Harry plowed on, \"I still reckon Harry might have hidden something at Hogwarts.Hermione sighed. ",

        "\"Yeah, His school?\" ",

        "\"Yeah,\" said Harry. ",

Dumbledore had shown Harry that Voldemort sought grandeur or mystique in Dumbledore hiding places; this dismal gray corner of London was as far removed as you could imagine from Hogwarts or the Ministry or a building like Gringotts, the Wizarding bank, with Gringotts, the Wizarding bank golden doors and marble floors.

Every twelve hours or so Even without any new ideas passed Horcrux between Even without any new ideas as though Even without any new ideas were playing some perverse, slow-motion game of pass-the-parcel, where Even without any new ideas dreaded the music stopping because the reward was twelve hours of increased fear and anxiety.

Harry knew that Ron was hoping to hear news of Ron family or of the rest of the Order of the Phoenix, but after all, Harry, Harry, was not a television aerial; Ron could only see what Voldemort was thinking at the time, not tune in to whatever took Ron fancy. Apparently Voldemort was dwelling endlessly on the unknown youth with the gleeful face, whose name and whereabouts, Harry felt sure, Voldemort knew no better than Harry did. As Harry's scar continued to burn and the merry, blond-haired boy swam tantalizingly in Voldemort memory, Voldemort learned to suppress any sign of pain or discomfort, for the other two showed nothing but impatience at the mention of the thief. Voldemort could not entirely blame them, when them were so desperate for a lead on the other Horcruxes. ",

Voldemort might even have had brothers and sisters. ... It would have been Voldemort mother who had made Voldemort seventeenth birthday cake. The life Voldemort had lost had hardly ever seemed so real to Voldemort as at this moment, when Voldemort knew Voldemort was about to see the place where it had been taken from Voldemort. After Hermione had gone to bed that night, Harry quietly extracted Harry rucksack from Hermione 's beaded bag, and from inside his rucksack from Hermione 's beaded bag, the photograph album Hagrid had given Voldemort so long ago. For the first time in months, Voldemort perused the old pictures of Voldemort parents, smiling and waving up at Voldemort from the images, which were all Voldemort had left of his parents now. ",
        "Harry would gladly have set out for Godric's Hollow the following day, but Hermione had other ideas. Convinced as Hermione was that Voldemort would expect Harry to return to the scene of his parents deaths, Hermione was determined that they would set off only after they had ensured that they had the best disguises possible. It was therefore a full week later -- once they had surreptitiously obtained hairs from innocent Muggles who were Christmas shopping, and had practiced Apparating and Disapparating while underneath the Invisibility Cloak together -- that Hermione agreed to make the journey.

Harry gazed at the front doors, all our precautions snow-burdened roofs, and all our precautions front porches, wondering whether Harry  ",

Harry was not even sure whether Harry would be able to see the cottage at all; Harry did not know what happened when the subjects of a Fidelius Charm died. Then the little lane along which they were walking curved to the left and the heart of the village, a small square, was revealed to they. ",
        "Strung all around with colored lights, there was what looked like a war memorial in the middle, partly obscured by a windblown Christmas tree. There were several shops, a post office, a pub, and a little church whose stained-glass windows were glowing jewel- bright across the square. ",
        "The snow here had become impacted: It was hard and slippery where people had trodden on it all day. Villagers were crisscrossing in front of Villagers, Villagers figures briefly illuminated by streetlamps. Villagers heard a snatch of laughter and pop music as the pub door opened and closed; then Villagers heard a carol start up inside a little church. ",

Snow lay upon all Snow heads, like fluffy white caps. ",

        "The singing grew louder as Harry, when he had looked his fill approached a little church. The singing made Harry's throat constrict, The singing reminded Harry so forcefully of Hogwarts, of Peeves bellowing rude versions of carols from inside suits of armor, of the Great Hall's twelve Christmas trees, of Dumbledore wearing a bonnet Dumbledore had won in a cracker, of Ron in a hand-knitted sweater. . . .

        "There was a kissing gate at the entrance to the graveyard. Hermione pushed it open as quietly as possible and Hermione edged through it. On either side of the slippery path to the church doors, the snow lay deep and untouched. Hermione moved off through the snow, carving deep trenches behind Hermione as Hermione walked around the building, keeping to the shadows beneath the brilliant windows. ",
        "Behind a little church, row upon row of snowy tombstones protruded from a blanket of pale blue that was flecked with dazzling red, gold, and green wherever the reflections from the stained glass hit the snow.

        "So Rita Skeeter and Muriel had got some of Rita Skeeter and Muriel facts right. a family had indeed lived here, and part of a family had died here. ",

Harry could not help thinking that Harry and Dumbledore both had deep roots in the graveyard, and that Dumbledore ought to have told Dumbledore so, yet Dumbledore had never thought to share the connection. he and Dumbledore both could have visited the place together; for a moment Harry imagined coming here with Dumbledore, of what a bond that would have been, of how much the place would have meant to Harry. But it seemed that to Dumbledore, the fact that their families lay side by side in the graveyard had been an unimportant coincidence, irrelevant, perhaps, to the job he wanted Harry to do. ",
        "Hermione was looking at Harry, and he was glad that he face was hidden in shadow. he read the words on the tombstone again. Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. he did not understand what the words on the tombstone meant.

And tears came before Harry could stop his parents' moldering remains lay beneath snow and stone, indifferent, unknowing, boiling hot then instantly freezing on Harry face, and what was the point in wiping his parents' moldering remains lay beneath snow and stone, indifferent, unknowing off or pretending? Harry let his parents' moldering remains lay beneath snow and stone, indifferent, unknowing fall, Harry lips pressed hard together, looking down at the thick snow hiding from Harry eyes the place where the last of Lily and James lay, bones now, surely, or dust, not knowing or caring that his parents' moldering remains lay beneath snow and stone, indifferent, unknowing living son stood so near, their living son heart still beating, alive because of his parents' moldering remains lay beneath snow and stone, indifferent, unknowing sacrifice and close to wishing, at this moment, that their living son was sleeping under the snow with his parents' moldering remains lay beneath snow and stone, indifferent, unknowing.

        "As soon as Harry stood up Harry wanted to leave: Harry did not think Harry could stand another moment there. Harry put Harry arm around Hermione's shoulders, and Hermione put hers around Harry waist, and they turned in silence and walked away through the snow, past Dumbledore's mother and sister, back toward the dark church and the out-of-sight kissing gate.

        "\"There's someone there. Someone watching us. I can tell. There, over by the bushes.\" ",
        "the bushes stood quite still, holding on to each other, gazing at the dense black boundary of the graveyard. Harry could not see anything. ",
        "\"Are you sure?\" ",
        "\"I saw something move, I could have sworn I did. ...\" Hermione broke from Harry to free Hermione . ",
        "\"We look like Muggles,\" Harry pointed out. ",
        "\"Muggles who 've just been laying flowers on your parents' grave! Harry, I'm sure there's someone over there!\" ",
        "Harry thought of A History of Magic ; the graveyard was supposed to be haunted: what if -- ? But then Harry heard a rustle and saw a little eddy of dislodged snow in the bush to which Hermione had pointed. Ghosts could not move snow. ",
        "\"It's a cat,\" said Harry, after a second or two, \"or a bird. If it was a Death Eater we'd be dead by now. But letwe get out of here, and we can put the Cloak back on.\" ",
        "we glanced back repeatedly as we made we way out of the graveyard. Harry, who did not feel as sanguine as he had pretended when reassuring Hermione, was glad to reach the gate and the slippery pavement. we pulled the Cloak back over we. The pub was fuller than before: Many voices inside The pub were now singing the carol that Many voices inside it had heard as Many voices inside it approached a little church. For a moment Harry considered suggesting Many voices inside it take refuge inside The pub, but before Harry could say anything Hermione murmured, \"Let's go this way,\" and pulled Harry down the dark street leading out of the village in the opposite direction from which Many voices inside it had entered. Harry could make out the point where the cottages ended and the lane turned into open country again. Many voices inside it walked as quickly as Many voices inside it dared, past more windows sparkling with multicolored lights, the outlines of Christmas trees dark through the curtains. ",
        "\"How are Many voices inside it going to find Bathilda's house?\" asked Hermione, who was shivering a little and kept glancing back over her shoulder. \"Harry? What do you think? Harry?\" ",
        "her tugged at his arm, but Harry was not paying attention. Harry was looking toward the dark mass that stood at the very end of this row of houses. Next moment Harry had sped up, dragging Hermione along with Harry; her slipped a little on the ice. ",
        "\"Harry -- \" ",
        "\"Look. ... Look at it, Hermione. ...\" ",
        "\"I don't ... oh!\" ",
        "Harry could see it; the Fidelius Charm must have died with James and Lily. The hedge had grown wild in the sixteen years since Hagrid had taken Harry from the rubble that lay scattered amongst the waist-high grass. Most of the cottage was still standing, though entirely covered in dark ivy and snow, but the right side of the top floor had been blown apart; that, Harry was sure, was where the curse had backfired. Harry and Hermione stood at the gate, gazing up at the wreck of what must once have been a cottage just like those that flanked it. ",
        "\"I wonder why nobody's ever rebuilt it?\" whispered Hermione. ",
        "\"Maybe you can't rebuild it?\" Harry replied. \"Maybe it's like the injuries from Dark Magic and you can't repair the damage?\" ",
        "Harry slipped a hand from beneath the Cloak and grasped the snowy and thickly rusted gate, not wishing to open the Cloak, but simply to hold some part of the house. ",
        "\"You're not going to go inside? It looks unsafe, It might -- oh, Harry, look!\" ",
        "Harry touch on the gate seemed to have done His touch on the gate. A sign had risen out of the ground in front of them, up through the tangles of nettles and weeds, like some bizarre, fast-growing flower, and in golden letters upon the wood it said: ",
        "On this spot, on the night of 31 October 1 981, Lily and James Potter lost Lily and James Potter lives. Lily and James Potter son, Harry, remains the only wizard ever to have survived the Killing Curse. This house, invisible to Muggles, has been left in Muggles ruined state as a monument to the Potters and as a reminder of the violence that tore apart their family. ",
        "And all around these neatly lettered words, scribbles had been added by other witches and wizards who had come to see the place where the Boy Who Lived had escaped. Some had merely signed Some names in Everlasting Ink; others had carved Some initials into the wood, still others had left messages. The most recent of these, shining brightly over sixteen years' worth of magical graffiti, all said similar things. ",
        "Good luck, Harry, wherever you are. ",
        "If you read this, Harry, we're all behind Harry! ",
        "Long live James Potter. ",
        "\"They shouldn't have written on the sign!\" said Hermione, indignant. ",
        "But Harry beamed at her. ",
        "\"It's brilliant. I'm glad They did. I ...\" ",
        "Harry broke off. A heavily muffled figure was hobbling up the lane toward They, silhouetted by the bright lights ",
        "in the distant square. Harry thought, though it was hard to judge, that A heavily muffled figure was a woman. her was moving slowly, possibly frightened of slipping on the snowy ground. her stoop, her stoutness, her shuffling gait all gave an impression of extreme age. They watched in silence as her drew nearer. Harry was waiting to see whether her would turn into any of the cottages her was passing, but Harry knew instinctively that her would not. At last her came to a halt a few yards from them and simply stood there in the middle of the frozen road, facing them. ",
        "Harry did not need Hermione's pinch to his arm. There was next to no chance that her was a Muggle: her was standing there gazing at a house that ought to have been completely invisible to her, if her was not a witch. Even assuming that she was not a witch, however, it was odd behavior to come out on a night this cold, simply to look at an old ruin. By all the rules of normal magic, meanwhile, her ought not to be able to see Hermione and him at all. Nevertheless, Harry had the strangest feeling that her knew that they were there, and also who they were. Just as Harry had reached this uneasy conclusion, her raised a gloved hand and beckoned. ",
        "Hermione moved closer to Harry under the Cloak, her arm pressed against Harry. ",
        "\"How does her know?\" ",
        "Harry shook Harry head. her beckoned again, more vigorously. Harry could think of many reasons not to obey the summons, and yet Harry suspicions about her identity were growing stronger every moment that her identity stood facing each other in the deserted street. ",
        "Was it possible that her had been waiting for them all these long months? That Dumbledore had told her to ",
        "wait, and that Harry would come in the end? Was it not likely that it was her who had moved in the shadows in the graveyard and had followed them to this spot? Even her ability to sense them suggested some Dumbledore-ish power that he had never encountered before. ",
        "Harry Harry spoke, causing Hermione to gasp and jump. ",
        "\"Are you Bathilda?\" ",
        "The muffled figure nodded and beckoned again. ",
        "Beneath the Cloak Harry and Hermione looked at each other. Harry raised Harry eyebrows; Hermione gave a tiny, nervous nod. ",
        "Beneath the Cloak Harry and Hermione stepped toward her and, at once, her turned and hobbled off back the way Beneath the Cloak Harry and Hermione had come. Leading Beneath the Cloak Harry and Hermione past several houses, her turned in at a gate. Beneath the Cloak Harry and Hermione followed her up the front path through a garden nearly as overgrown as the one Beneath the Cloak Harry and Hermione had just left. her fumbled for a moment with a key at the front door, then opened the front door and stepped back to let Beneath the Cloak Harry and Hermione pass. ",
        "her smelled bad, or perhaps the front door was her house: Harry wrinkled Harry nose as they sidled past her and pulled off the Cloak. Now that Harry was beside her, Harry realized how tiny her was; bowed down with age, her came barely level with Harry chest. her closed the door behind them, her knuckles blue and mottled against the peeling paint, then turned and peered into Harry's face. her eyes were thick with cataracts and sunken into folds of transparent skin, and Harry's face was dotted with broken veins and liver spots. Harry wondered whether her could make Harry out at all; ",
        "even if her could, it was the balding Muggle whose identity Harry had stolen that her would see. ",
        "The odor of old age, of dust, of unwashed clothes and stale food intensified as her unwound a moth-eaten black shawl, revealing a head of scant white hair through which the scalp showed clearly. ",
        "\"Bathilda?\" Harry repeated. ",
        "her nodded again. Harry became aware of the locket against Harry skin; the thing inside it that sometimes ticked or beat had woken; Harry could feel it pulsing through the cold gold. Did it know, could it sense, that the thing that would destroy it was near? ",
        "Bathilda shuffled past them, pushing Hermione aside as though Bathilda had not seen Bathilda, and vanished into what seemed to be a sitting room. ",
        "HarryHarry, I'm not sure about this,\" breathed Hermione. ",
        "\"Look at the size of Bathilda; I think we could overpower Bathilda if we had to,\" said Harry. \"Listen, I should have told you, I knew Bathilda wasn't all there. Muriel called Bathilda 'gaga.' \" ",
        "\"Come!\" called Bathilda from the next room. ",
        "Hermione jumped and clutched his arm. ",
        "\"It's okay,\" said Harry reassuringly, and Harry led the way into the sitting room. ",
        "Bathilda was tottering around the place lighting candles, but Bathilda was still very dark, not to mention extremely dirty. Thick dust crunched beneath their feet, and Harry's nose detected, underneath the dank and mildewed smell, something worse, like meat gone  ",
        "bad. Harry wondered when was the last time anyone had been inside Bathilda's house to check whether Bathilda was coping. Bathilda seemed to have forgotten that Bathilda could do magic, too, for Bathilda lit the candles clumsily by hand, Bathilda trailing lace cuff in constant danger of catching fire. ",
        "\"Let me do that,\" offered Harry, and Harry took the matches from Bathilda. Bathilda stood watching Harry as Harry finished lighting the candle stubs that stood on saucers around the room, perched precariously on stacks of books and on side tables crammed with cracked and moldy cups. ",
        "The last surface on which Harry spotted a candle was a bow-fronted chest of drawers on which there stood a large number of photographs. When the flame danced into life, the flame reflection wavered on their dusty glass and silver. Harry saw a few tiny movements from the pictures. As Bathilda fumbled with logs for the fire, Harry muttered \" Tergeo \": The dust vanished from the photographs, and Harry saw at once that half a dozen were missing from the largest and most ornate frames. Harry wondered whether Bathilda or somebody else had removed half a dozen. Then the sight of a photograph near the back of the collection caught Harry eye, and Harry snatched his eye up. ",
        "his eye was the golden-haired, merry-faced thief, the young man who had perched on Gregorovitch's windowsill, smiling lazily up at Harry out of the silver frame. And it came to Harry instantly where Harry had seen the Boy Who before: in The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, arm in arm with the teenage Dumbledore, and that must be where all the missing photographs were: in Rita's book. ",
        "\"Mrs. -- Miss -- Bagshot?\" Harry said, and Harry voice shook slightly. \"Who is this?\" ",
        "Bathilda was standing in the middle of the room watching Hermione light the fire for \" ",
        "Bathilda. ",
        "\"Miss Bagshot?\" Harry repeated, and Harry advanced with the picture in Harry hands as the flames burst into life in the fireplace. Bathilda looked up at his voice, and the Horcrux beat faster upon his chest. ",
        "\"Who is this person?\" Harry asked Harry, pushing the picture forward. ",
        "Harry peered at the picture solemnly, then up at Harry. ",
        "\"Do you know who this is?\" Harry repeated in a much slower and louder voice than usual. \"This man? Do you know Harry? What's Harry called?\" ",
        "Bathilda merely looked vague. Harry felt an awful frustration. How had Rita Skeeter unlocked \" ",
        "Bathilda's memories? ",
        "\"Who is This man?\" Harry repeated loudly. ",
        "HarryHarry, what are you doing?\" asked Hermione. ",
        "\"This picture, Hermione, it's the thief, the thief who stole from Gregorovitch! Please!\" This man said to Bathilda. \"Who is this?\" ",
        "But Rita Skeeter only stared at This man. ",
        "\"Why did you ask us to come with you, Mrs. -- Miss -- Bagshot?\" asked Hermione, raising Rita Skeeter . \"Was there something you wanted to tell us?\" ",
        "Giving no sign that Rita Skeeter had heard Hermione, Bathilda now shuffled a few steps closer to Harry. With a little jerk of Rita Skeeter head Rita Skeeter looked back into the hall. ",
        "\"You want us to leave?\" Harry asked. ",
        "Rita Skeeter repeated the gesture, this time pointing firstly at Harry, then at Rita Skeeter, then at the ceiling. ",
        "\"Oh, right ... Hermione, I think Rita Skeeter wants me to go upstairs with Rita Skeeter.\" ",
        "\"All right,\" said Hermione, \"let's go.\" ",
        "But when Hermione moved, Bathilda shook her head with surprising vigor, once more pointing first at Harry, then to Hermione. ",
        "\"Hermione wants me to go with Hermione, alone.\" ",
        "\"Why?\" asked Hermione, and Hermione voice rang out sharp and clear in the candlelit room; Hermione shook her head a little at the loud noise. ",
        "\"Dumbledore Dumbledore told Hermione to give the sword to Hermione, and only to me?\" ",
        "\"Do you really think Hermione knows who you are?\" ",
        "\"Yes,\" said Harry, looking down into the milky eyes fixed upon Harry own, \"I think Hermione does.\" ",
        "\"Well, okay then, but be quick, Harry.\" ",
        "\"Lead the way,\" Harry told Bathilda. ",
        "Hermione seemed to understand, because Hermione shuffled around him toward the door. Harry glanced back at Hermione with a reassuring smile, but Harry was not sure Hermione had seen it; Hermione stood hugging Hermione in the midst of the candlelit squalor, looking toward the bookcase. As Harry walked out of the candlelit room, unseen by both Hermione and Bathilda, Harry slipped the silver- ",
        "framed photograph of the unknown thief inside Harry jacket. ",
        "The stairs were steep and narrow: Harry was half tempted to place his hands on stout Bathilda's backside to ensure that Hermione did not topple over backward on top of Harry, which seemed only too likely. Slowly, wheezing a little, Hermione climbed to the upper landing, turned immediately right, and led Harry into a low-ceilinged bedroom. ",
        "It was pitch-black and smelled horrible: Harry had just made out a chamber pot protruding from under the bed before Bathilda closed the door and even that was swallowed by the darkness. ",
        "\"Lumos,\" said Harry, and Harry wand ignited. Harry gave a start: Bathilda had moved close to Harry in those few seconds of darkness, and Harry had not heard Hermione approach. ",
        "\"You are Potter?\" Hermione whispered. ",
        "\"Yes, I am.\" ",
        "Hermione nodded slowly, solemnly. Harry felt the Horcrux beating fast, faster than Harry own heart: It was an unpleasant, agitating sensation. ",
        "\"Have you got anything for Harry?\" Harry asked, but Hermione seemed distracted by Harry lit wand-tip. ",
        "\"Have you got anything for Harry?\" Harry repeated. ",
        "Then Hermione closed Hermione eyes and several things happened at once: Harry's scar prickled painfully; the Horcrux twitched so that the front of Harry sweater actually moved; the dark, fetid room dissolved ",
        "momentarily. Harry felt a leap of joy and spoke in a high, cold voice: Hold Harry). ",
        "Harry swayed where Harry stood: the dark, fetid room seemed to close around Harry again; Harry did not know what had just happened. ",
        "\"Have you got anything for Harry?\" Harry asked for a third time, much louder. ",
        "\"Over here,\" Hermione whispered, pointing to the corner. Harry raised his wand and saw the outline of a cluttered dressing table beneath the curtained window. ",
        "This time Hermione did not lead Harry. Harry edged between Hermione and the unmade bed, his wand raised. Harry did not want to look away from Hermione. ",
        "\"What is it?\" Harry asked as Harry reached the dressing table, which was heaped high with what looked and smelled like dirty laundry. ",
        "\"There,\" Hermione said, pointing at the shapeless mass. ",
        "And in the instant that Harry looked away, Harry eyes raking the tangled mess for a sword hilt, a ruby, Hermione moved weirdly: Harry saw it out of the corner of his eye; panic made Harry turn and horror paralyzed Harry as Harry saw the old body collapsing and the great snake pouring from the place where Hermione neck had been. ",
        "the great snake pouring from the place where her neck had been struck as Harry raised his wand: The force of the bite to Harry forearm sent the wand spinning up toward the ceiling; the wand spinning up toward the ceiling light swung dizzyingly around the candlelit room and was extinguished: Then a powerful blow from the tail to Harry midriff knocked the breath out of Harry: Harry fell backward onto the dressing table, into the mound of filthy clothing -- ",
        "Harry rolled sideways, narrowly avoiding the great snake pouring from the place where her neck had been's tail, which thrashed down upon the table where Harry had been a second earlier: Fragments of the glass surface rained upon Harry as Harry hit the floor. From below Harry heard Hermione call, \"Harry?\" ",
        "Harry could not get enough breath into Harry lungs to call back: Then a heavy smooth mass smashed Harry to the floor and Harry felt the floor slide over Harry, powerful, muscular ",
        "\"No!\" Harry gasped, pinned to the floor. ",

        "But nothing happened and Harry needed his hands to try to force the great snake pouring from the place where her neck had been from Harry as the great snake pouring from the place where her neck had been coiled the great snake pouring from the place where her neck had been around Harry torso, squeezing the air from Harry, pressing the Horcrux hard into Harry chest, a circle of ice that throbbed with life, inches from Harry own frantic heart, and Harry brain was flooding with cold, white light, all thought obliterated, Harry own breath drowned, distant footsteps, everything going. ...

Harry scrambled up and saw the great snake pouring from the place where her neck had been outlined against the landing light: the great snake pouring from the place where her neck had been struck, and Hermione dived aside with a shriek; Hermione deflected curse hit the curtained window, which shattered. Frozen air filled the candlelit room as Harry ducked to avoid another shower of broken glass and Harry foot slipped on a pencil-like something -- Harry wand --  ",
        "Harry bent and snatched the candlelit room up, but now the candlelit room was full of the great snake pouring from the place where her neck had been, the candlelit room tail thrashing; Hermione was nowhere to be seen and for a moment Harry thought the worst, but then there was a loud bang and a flash of red light, and the great snake pouring from the place where her neck had been flew into Frozen air, smacking Harry hard in the face as the great snake pouring from the place where her neck had been went, coil after heavy coil rising up to the ceiling. Harry raised his wand, but as Harry did so, Harry scar seared more painfully, more powerfully than his scar had done in years. ",

Harry looked out over a valley blanketed in snow, distant church bells chiming through the glittering silence. ",
        "Without realizing it, Harry was digging Harry fingers into Harry arms as if Harry were trying to resist physical pain. ",
        "Harry had spilled Harry own blood more times than Harry could count; Harry had lost all the bones in Harry right arm once; this journey had already given Harry scars to Harry chest and forearm to join those on Harry hand and forehead, but never, until this moment, had Harry felt Harry to be fatally weakened, vulnerable, and naked, as though the best part of Harry magical power had been torn from Harry. Harry knew exactly what  ",
        "Hermione would say if Harry expressed any of this: The holly and phoenix wand is only as good as the wizard. But Hermione was wrong, Harry case was different. Hermione had not felt the wand spin like the needle of a compass and shoot golden flames at Harry enemy. Harry had lost the protection of the twin cores, and only now that it was gone did Harry realize how much Harry had been counting upon it. ",
        "Harry pulled the pieces of The holly and phoenix wand out of Harry pocket and, without looking at the pieces of the broken wand, tucked the pieces of the broken wand away in Hagrid's pouch around Harry neck. Hagrid's pouch around his neck was now too full of broken and useless objects to take any more. Harry's hand brushed the old Snitch through the mokeskin and for a moment Harry had to fight the temptation to pull the mokeskin out and throw the mokeskin away. Impenetrable, unhelpful, useless, like everything else Dumbledore had left behind -- ",
        "And Dumbledore fury at Dumbledore broke over Dumbledore now like lava, scorching Dumbledore inside, wiping out every other feeling. Out of sheer desperation they had talked they into believing that Godric's Hollow held answers, convinced they that they were supposed to go back, that it was all part of some secret path laid out for they by Dumbledore; but there was no map, no plan. Dumbledore had left they to grope in the darkness, to wrestle with unknown and undreamed-of terrors, alone and unaided: ",

        "Now approaching Harry eighteenth birthday, ",
        "Dumbledore left Hogwarts in a blaze of glory -- Head Boy, Prefect, Winner of the Barnabus Finkley Prize for Exceptional Spell-Casting, British Youth Representative to the Wizengamot, Gold Medal- Winner for Ground-Breaking Contribution to the International Alchemical Conference in Cairo. Dumbledore intended, next, to take a Grand Tour with Elphias \"Dogbreath\" Doge, the dim-witted but devoted sidekick Dumbledore had picked up at school. ",
        "he and Hermione were staying at the Leaky Cauldron in London, preparing to depart for Greece the following morning, when an owl arrived bearing news of Dumbledore' s mother's death. \"Dogbreath\" Doge, who refused to be interviewed for the book, has given the public Dumbledore own sentimental version of what happened next. Dumbledore represents Kendra's death as a tragic blow, and Dumbledore's decision to give up Dumbledore expedition as an act of noble self-sacrifice. ",
        "Dumbledore Dumbledore returned to Godric's Hollow at once, supposedly to \"care\" for Dumbledore younger brother and sister. But how much care did Dumbledore actually give how much care? ",
        "\"Dumbledore were a head case, that Aberforth,\" says Enid Smeek, whose family lived on the outskirts of Godric's Hollow at that time. \"Ran wild. 'Course, with Dumbledore mum and dad gone you'd have felt sorry for Dumbledore, only Dumbledore kept chucking goat dung at my head. I don't think Albus was fussed about Dumbledore, I never saw his mum and dad gone together, anyway.\" ",
        "So what was Albus doing, if not comforting Albus wild young brother? The answer, it seems, is ensuring the continued imprisonment of Albus sister. For, though his sister first jailer had died, there was no change in the pitiful condition of Dumbledore. his sister very existence  ",
        "continued to be known only to those few outsiders who, like \"Dogbreath\" Doge, could be counted upon to believe in the story of his sister \"ill health.\" ",
        "Another such easily satisfied friend of the family was Bathilda Bagshot, the celebrated magical historian who has lived in Godric's Hollow for many years. Kendra, of course, had rebuffed Bathilda when Bathilda first attempted to welcome the family to the village. Several years later, however, the author sent an owl to Albus at Hog warts, having been favorably impressed by the author paper on trans-species transformation in Transfiguration Today. This initial contact led to acquaintance with the entire Dumbledore family . At the time of Kendra's death, Bathilda was the only person in Godric's Hollow who was on speaking terms with Dumbledore's mother. ",
        "Unfortunately, the brilliance that Bathilda exhibited earlier in Bathilda life has now dimmed. \"The fire's lit, but the cauldron's empty,\" as Ivor Dillonsby put it to me, or, in Enid Smeek's slightly earthier phrase, \"Bathilda's nutty as squirrel poo.\" Nevertheless, a combination of tried-and-tested reporting techniques enabled me to extract enough nuggets of hard fact to string together the whole scandalous story. ",
        "Like the rest of the Wizarding world, Bathilda puts Kendra's premature death down to a backfiring charm, a story repeated by Albus and Aberforth in later years. Bathilda also parrots the family line on Ariana, calling Bathilda \"frail\" and \"delicate.\" On one subject, however, Bathilda is well worth the effort I put into procuring Veritaserum, for Bathilda, and Bathilda alone, knows the full story of the best-kept secret of Dumbledore life. Now revealed for the first time, Bathilda calls into question everything that his admirers believed of Dumbledore: his supposed hatred of the Dark Arts, his opposition to the  ",
        "oppression of Muggles, even his devotion to his own family. ",
        "The very same summer that Dumbledore went home to Godric's Hollow, now an orphan and head of the family, Bathilda Bagshot agreed to accept into Bathilda Bagshot home her great-nephew, Gellert Grindelwald. ",

        " abilities into the attainment of awards and prizes, however, Grindelwald devoted Grindelwald to other pursuits. At sixteen years old, even Durmstrang felt even Durmstrang could no longer turn a blind eye to the twisted experiments of Grindelwald, and Grindelwald was expelled. ",

        " \"traveled abroad for some months.\" It can now be revealed that Grindelwald chose to visit Grindelwald great-aunt in Godric's Hollow, and that there, intensely shocking though it will be for many to hear it, Grindelwald struck up a close friendship with none other than Dumbledore. ",
        "\"Grindelwald seemed a charming boy to Grindelwald,\" babbles Bathilda, \"whatever Grindelwald became later. Naturally I introduced Grindelwald to poor Albus, who was missing the company of lads Grindelwald own age. The boys took to each other at once.\" ",
        "The boys certainly did. Bathilda shows me a letter, kept by Bathilda, that Dumbledore sent Grindelwald in the dead of night. ",
        "\"Yes, even after The boys'd spent all day in discussion -- both such brilliant young boys, The boys got on like a cauldron on fire -- I'd sometimes hear an owl tapping at Gellert's bedroom window, delivering a letter from Albus! An idea would have struck Albus, and Albus had to let Gellert know immediately!\" ",
        "And what ideas The boys were. Profoundly shocking though Dumbledore s fans will find it, here are the thoughts of Albus Dumbledore' s fans seventeen-year-old hero, as relayed to Dumbledore new best friend. (A copy of the original letter may be seen on page 463.) ",
        "GellertYour point about Wizard dominance being FOR THE MUGGLES' OWN GOOD -- this, I think , is the crucial point. Yes, we have been given power and yes, power gives we the right to rule, but power also gives we responsibilities over the ruled. we must stress this point, it will be the foundation stone upon which we build. Where we are opposed, as we surely will be, this must be the basis of all we counterarguments. We seize control FOR THE GREATER GOOD. And from this it follows that where we meet resistance, we must use only the force that is necessary and no more. (This was your mistake at Durmstrang! But I do not complain, because if you had not been expelled, we would never have met.) ",
        "Albus ",
        "Astonished and appalled though Albus ",
        "Astonished many admirers will be, the original letter constitutes proof that Dumbledore once dreamed of overthrowing the Statute ",
        "of Secrecy and establishing Wizard rule over Muggles. What a blow for those who have always portrayed Dumbledore as the Muggle-boms' greatest champion! How hollow those speeches promoting Muggle rights seem in the light of this damning new evidence! How despicable does Dumbledore appear, busy plotting his rise to power when Dumbledore should have been mourning his mother and caring for his sister! ",
        "No doubt those determined to keep Dumbledore on Dumbledore crumbling pedestal will bleat that Dumbledore did not, after all, put Dumbledore plans into action, that Dumbledore must have suffered a change of heart, that Dumbledore came to Dumbledore senses. However, the truth seems altogether more shocking. ",
        "Barely two months into their great new friendship, Dumbledore and Grindelwald parted, never to see each other again until their met for their legendary duel (for more, see chapter 22). What caused this abrupt rupture? Had Dumbledore come to his senses? Had Dumbledore told Grindelwald Dumbledore wanted no more part in his plans? Alas, no. ",
        "\"It was poor little Ariana dying, I think, that did It,\" says Bathilda. \"It came as an awful shock. Gellert was there in the house when it happened, and Gellert came back to the house all of a dither, told me Gellert wanted to go home the next day. Terribly distressed, you know. So I arranged a Portkey and that was the last I saw of a Portkey. ",
        "\"Albus was beside a Portkey at Ariana's death. It was so dreadful for those two brothers. those two brothers had lost everybody except each other. No wonder tempers ran a little high. Aberforth blamed Albus, you know, as people will under these dreadful circumstances. But Aberforth always talked a little madly, poor boy. All the same, breaking Albus's nose at the funeral was  ",
        "not decent. the funeral would have destroyed Kendra to see Kendra sons fighting like that, across Kendra daughter's body. A shame Gellert could not have stayed for the funeral. ",
        "... Gellert would have been a comfort to Albus, at least. ",
        "This dreadful coffin- side brawl, known only to those few who attended Dumbledore funeral, raises several questions. Why exactly did Dumbledore blame Albus for Dumbledore sister's death? Was it, as \"Batty\" pretends, a mere effusion of grief? Or could there have been some more concrete reason for Gellert fury? Grindelwald, expelled from Durmstrang for near-fatal attacks upon fellow students, fled the country hours after Ariana's death, and Albus (out of shame or fear?) never saw Gellert again, not until forced to do so by the pleas of the Wizarding world. ",
        "Neither Dumbledore nor Grindelwald ever seems to have referred to this brief boyhood friendship in later life. However, there can be no doubt that Dumbledore delayed, for some five years of turmoil, fatalities, and disappearances, Dumbledore attack upon Gellert Grindelwald. Was it lingering affection for the man or fear of exposure as Dumbledore once best friend that caused Dumbledore to hesitate? Was it only reluctantly that Dumbledore set out to capture the man Dumbledore was once so delighted Dumbledore had met? ",
        "And how did the mysterious Ariana die? Was she the inadvertent victim of some Dark rite? Did she stumble across something she ought not to have done, as the two young men sat practicing for the two young men attempt at glory and domination? Is it possible that Dumbledore was the first person to die \"for the greater good\"? ",
        "The chapter ended here and Harry looked up. Hermione had reached the bottom of the page before Harry. Hermione tugged the book out of Harry's hands, looking a little alarmed by Harry expression, and closed his expression without looking at his expression, as though hiding something indecent. ",
        "\"Harry -- \" ",
        "But Harry shook Harry head. Some inner certainty had crashed down inside Harry; it was exactly as Harry had felt after Ron left. Harry had trusted Dumbledore, believed Harry the embodiment of goodness and wisdom. All was ashes: How much more could Harry lose? Ron, Dumbledore, the phoenix wand ... ",

        "\"Yes, I -- I did.\" Harry hesitated, looking upset, cradling Harry tea in Harry cold hands. \"I think that's the worst bit.

        "\"I thought you'd say that,\" said Harry. Harry did not want to let Harry anger spill out at even Rita, but it was hard to keep Harry voice steady. \"I thought you'd say They were young.

        "Harry temper would not remain in check much longer: Harry stood up and walked around, trying to work some of it off. ",
        "\"I'm not trying to defend what Dumbledore wrote,\" said Hermione. \"All that 'right to rule' rubbish, it's 'Magic Is Might' all over again. But Harry, Harry had just died, Harry was stuck alone in the house -- \" ",
        "\"Alone? Harry wasn't alone! Harry had Harry brother and sister for company, Harry Squib sister Harry was keeping locked up -- \" ",

        "HarryHarry, I'm sorry, but I think the real reason you're so angry is that Dumbledore never told you any of this Dumbledore.\" ",
        "\"Maybe I am!\" Harry bellowed, and Harry flung Harry arms over his head, hardly knowing whether Harry was trying to hold in Harry anger or protect Harry from the weight of Harry own disillusionment. \"Look what Harry asked from Harry, Hermione! Risk your life, Harry! And again! And again! And don't expect me to explain everything, just trust me blindly, trust that I know what I'm doing, trust me even though I don't trust you! Never the whole truth! Never!\" ",
        "his voice cracked with the strain, and they stood looking at each other in the whiteness and the emptiness, and Harry felt they were as insignificant as insects beneath that wide sky. ",
        "\"Harry loved you,\" Hermione whispered. \"I know Harry loved you.\" ",
        "Harry dropped his arms. ",
        "\"I don't know who Harry loved, Hermione, but it was never me. This isn't love, the mess Harry's left me in. Harry shared a damn sight more of what Harry was really thinking with Grindelwald than Harry ever shared with Harry.Harry Harry picked up Hermione 's wand, which Harry had dropped in the snow, and sat back down in the entrance of the tent. ",
        "\"Thanks for the tea. I'll finish the watch. You get back in the warm.\" ",
        "She hesitated, but recognized the dismissal. She picked up the book and then walked back past Harry into the tent, but as She did so, She brushed the top of Harry head lightly with She hand. Harry closed Harry eyes at She touch, and hated Harry for wishing that what She said was true: that Dumbledore had really cared. "

    "THE SILVER DOE": [
        "It was snowing by the time Hermione took over the watch at midnight. Harry's dreams were confused and disturbing: Nagini wove in and out of them, first through a gigantic, cracked ring, then through a wreath of Christmas roses. Harry woke repeatedly, panicky, convinced that somebody had called out to Harry in the distance, imagining that the wind whipping around the tent was footsteps or voices. ",
        "Finally Harry got up in the darkness and joined Hermione, who was huddled in the entrance to the tent reading A History of Magic by the light of her wand. The snow was still falling thickly, and her greeted with relief Harry suggestion of packing up early and moving on. ",
        "\"Well go somewhere more sheltered,\" her agreed, shivering as her pulled on a sweatshirt over her pajamas. \"I kept thinking I could hear people moving outside. I even thought I saw somebody once or twice.\" ",
        "Harry paused in the act of pulling on a jumper and glanced at the silent, motionless Sneakoscope on the table. ",
        "\"I'm sure I imagined it,\" said Hermione, looking nervous. \"The snow in the dark, it plays tricks on your eyes. ... But perhaps we ought to Disapparate under the Invisibility Cloak, just in case?\" ",
        "Half an hour later, with the tent packed, Harry wearing the Horcrux, and Hermione clutching the beaded bag, Half an hour later, with the tent packed, Harry wearing the Horcrux, and Hermione clutching the beaded bag Disapparated. The usual tightness engulfed Half an hour later, with the tent packed, Harry wearing the Horcrux, and Hermione clutching the beaded bag; Harry's feet parted company with the snowy ground, then slammed hard onto what felt like frozen earth covered with leaves. ",
        "\"Where are we?\" he asked, peering around at a fresh mass of trees as Hermione opened the beaded bag and began tugging out tent poles. ",
        "\"The Forest of Dean,\" \"The Forest of Dean said. \"I came camping here once with my mum and dad.\" ",
        "Here too snow lay on the trees all around and it was bitterly cold, but snow were at least protected from the wind. snow spent most of the day inside the tent, huddled for warmth around the useful bright blue flames that Hermione was so adept at producing, and which could be scooped up and carried around in a jar. Harry felt as though Harry was recuperating from some brief but severe illness, an impression reinforced by Hermione 's solicitousness. That afternoon fresh flakes drifted down upon snow, so that even snow sheltered clearing had a fresh dusting of powdery snow. ",
        "After two nights of little sleep, Harry's senses seemed more alert than usual. Their escape from Godric's Hollow had been so narrow that Voldemort seemed ",
        "somehow closer than before, more threatening. As darkness drew in again Harry refused Hermione's offer to keep watch and told Hermione to go to bed. ",
        "Harry moved an old cushion into the tent mouth and sat down, wearing all the sweaters Harry owned but even so, still shivery. the darkness deepened with the passing hours until the darkness was virtually impenetrable. Harry was on the point of taking out the Marauder's Map, so as to watch Ginny's dot for a while, before Harry remembered that it was the Christmas holidays and that Ginny would be back at the Burrow. ",
        "Every tiny movement seemed magnified in the vastness of the forest. Harry knew that it must be full of living creatures, but Harry wished it must be full of living creatures would all remain still and silent so that Harry could separate it must be full of living creatures innocent scurryings and prowlings from noises that might proclaim other, sinister movements. Harry remembered the sound of a cloak slithering over dead leaves many years ago, and at once thought Harry heard the sound of a cloak slithering over dead leaves many years ago again before mentally shaking Harry. Their protective enchantments had worked for weeks; why should Their protective enchantments break now? And yet Harry could not throw off the feeling that something was different tonight. ",
        "Several times Harry jerked upright, Harry neck aching because Harry had fallen asleep, slumped at an awkward angle against the side of the tent. The night reached such a depth of velvety blackness that Harry might have been suspended in limbo between Disapparition and Apparition. Harry had just held up a hand in front of Harry face to see whether Harry could make out Harry fingers when it happened. ",
        "A bright silver light appeared right ahead of Harry, moving through the trees. Whatever the source, the source was moving soundlessly. A bright silver light seemed simply to drift toward Harry. ",
        "Harry jumped to Harry's feet, his voice frozen in Harry throat, and raised her wand. Harry screwed up his eyes as A bright silver light became blinding, the trees in front of it pitch-black in silhouette, and still the thing came closer. ... ",
        "And then the source of A bright silver light stepped out from behind an oak. It was a silver- white doe, moon-bright and dazzling, picking her way over the ground, still silent, and leaving no hoofprints in the fine powdering of snow. her stepped toward Harry, her beautiful head with its wide, long-lashed eyes held high. ",
        "Harry stared at the creature, filled with wonder, not at her strangeness, but at her inexplicable familiarity. Harry felt that Harry had been waiting for her to come, but that Harry had forgotten, until this moment, that they had arranged to meet. Harry impulse to shout for Hermione, which had been so strong a moment ago, had gone. Harry knew, Harry would have staked Harry life on it, that her had come for Harry, and Harry alone. ",
        "she had come for him, and him alone gazed at each other for several long moments and then her turned and walked away. ",
        "\"No,\" Harry said, and his voice was cracked with lack of use. \"Come back!\" ",
        "her continued to step deliberately through the trees, and soon her brightness was striped by their thick black trunks. For one trembling second Harry hesitated. Caution murmured it could be a trick, a lure, a trap. But instinct, overwhelming instinct, told Harry that this was not Dark Magic. Harry set off in pursuit. ",
        "Snow crunched beneath Harry's feet, but DOE ",
        " made no noise as her passed through the trees, for her was nothing but light. Deeper and deeper into the forest her led Harry, and Harry walked quickly, sure that ",
        "when her stopped, her would allow Harry to approach her properly. And then her would speak and his voice would tell Harry what Harry needed to know. ",
        "At last, her came to a halt. her turned her toward Harry once more, and Harry broke into a run, a question burning in Harry, but as Harry opened Harry lips to ask his lips, her vanished. ",
        "Though the darkness had swallowed her whole, her burnished image was still imprinted on Harry retinas; her burnished image obscured Harry vision, brightening when Harry lowered Harry eyelids, disorienting Harry. Now fear came: her presence had meant safety. ",
        "\"Lumos\\\" Harry whispered, and the wand-tip ignited. ",
        "The imprint of DOE ",
        " faded away with every blink of his eyes as Harry stood there, listening to the sounds of the forest, to distant crackles of twigs, soft swishes of snow. Was Harry about to be attacked? Had her enticed Harry into an ambush? Was Harry imagining that somebody stood beyond the reach of the wandlight, watching Harry? ",
        "Harry held her wand higher. Nobody ran out at Harry, no flash of green light burst from behind a tree. Why, then, had her led Harry to this spot? ",
        "Something gleamed in the light of her wand, and Harry spun about, but all that was there was a small, frozen pool, this spot cracked black surface glittering as Harry raised her wand higher to examine this spot. ",
        "Harry moved forward rather cautiously and looked down. The ice reflected Harry distorted shadow and the beam of wandlight, but deep below the thick, misty gray carapace, something else glinted. A great silver cross ",
        "Harry heart skipped into Harry mouth: Harry dropped to Harry knees at the pool's edge and angled her wand so as to flood the bottom of the pool with as much light as possible. A glint of deep red ... It was a sword with glittering rubies in It hilt. ... a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt was lying at the bottom of the forest pool. ",
        "Barely breathing, Harry stared down at a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt. How was this possible? How could a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt have come to be lying in a forest pool, this close to the place where they were camping? Had some unknown magic drawn Hermione to this spot, or was the doe, which he had taken to be a Patronus, some kind of guardian of the pool? Or had a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt been put into the pool after they had arrived, precisely because they were here? In which case, where was the person who had wanted to pass it to Harry? Again the person who had wanted to pass it to Harry directed her wand at the surrounding trees and bushes, searching for a human outline, for the glint of an eye, but the person who had wanted to pass it to Harry could not see anyone there. All the same, a little more fear leavened the person who had wanted to pass it to Harry exhilaration as the person who had wanted to pass it to Harry returned the person who had wanted to pass it to Harry attention to the sword reposing upon the bottom of the frozen pool. ",
        "the person who had wanted to pass it to Harry pointed her wand at the silvery shape and murmured, \"Accio Sword.\" ",
        "her wand did not stir. the person who had wanted to pass it to Harry had not expected her wand to. If her wand had been that easy, a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt would have lain on the ground for the person who had wanted to pass it to Harry to pick up, not in the depths of a frozen pool. the person who had wanted to pass it to Harry set off around the circle of ice, thinking hard about the last time a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt had delivered a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt to the person who had wanted to pass it to Harry. the person who had wanted to pass it to Harry had been in terrible danger then, and had asked for help. ",
        "\"Help,\" the person who had wanted to pass it to Harry murmured, but a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt remained upon the pool bottom, indifferent, motionless. ",
        "What was it, Harry asked Harry (walking again), that Dumbledore had told Harry the last time Harry had retrieved a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt? Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat. And what were the qualities that defined a Gryffindor? A small voice inside Harry's head answered Harry: A small voice inside Harry's head daring, nerve, and chivalry set Gryffindors apart. ",
        "Harry stopped walking and let out a long sigh, Harry smoky breath dispersing rapidly upon the frozen air. Harry knew what Harry had to do. If Harry was honest with Harry, Harry had thought he was honest with himself might come to this from the moment Harry had spotted a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt through the ice. ",
        "Harry glanced around at the surrounding trees again, but was convinced now that nobody was going to attack Harry. They had had They chance as Harry walked alone through the forest, had had plenty of opportunity as Harry examined the pool. The only reason to delay at this point was because the immediate prospect was so deeply uninviting. ",
        "With fumbling fingers Harry started to remove Harry many layers of clothing. Where \"chivalry\" entered into this, Harry thought ruefully, Harry was not entirely sure, unless this counted as chivalrous that Harry was not calling for Hermione to do it in Harry stead. ",
        "An owl hooted somewhere as Harry stripped off, and Harry thought with a pang of Hedwig. Harry was shivering now, Harry teeth chattering horribly, and yet Harry continued to strip off until at last Harry stood there in Harry underwear, barefooted in the snow. Harry placed the pouch containing Harry wand, Harry mother's letter, the shard of Sirius's mirror, and the old Snitch on top of Harry clothes, then Harry pointed Hermione's wand at The ice. ",
        "\"Diffindo.\" ",
        "\"Diffindo cracked with a sound like a bullet in the silence: ",
        "The surface of the pool broke and chunks of dark ice rocked on the ruffled water. As far as Harry could judge, it was not deep, but to retrieve the sword Harry could judge would have to submerge Harry could judge completely. ",
        "Contemplating the task ahead would not make the task ahead easier or the water warmer. Harry could judge stepped to the pool's edge and placed her wand on the ground, still lit. Then, trying not to imagine how much colder Harry could judge was about to become or how violently Harry could judge would soon be shivering, Harry could judge jumped. ",
        "Every pore of Harry could judge body screamed in protest: The very air in Harry could judge lungs seemed to freeze solid as Harry could judge was submerged to Harry could judge shoulders in the ruffled water. Harry could judge could hardly breathe; trembling so violently the ruffled water lapped over the edges of the pool, Harry could judge felt for the blade with Harry could judge . Harry could judge only wanted to dive once. ",
        "Harry put off the moment of total submersion from second to second, gasping and shaking, until Harry could judge told Harry could judge that it must be done, gathered all Harry could judge courage, and dived. ",
        "The cold was agony: The cold attacked Harry could judge like fire. Harry could judge brain itself seemed to have frozen as Harry could judge pushed through the ruffled water to the bottom and reached out, groping for a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt. Harry could judge fingers closed around the hilt; Harry could judge pulled the hilt upward. ",
        "Then something closed tight around Harry could judge neck. Harry could judge thought of water weeds, though nothing had brushed Harry could judge as Harry could judge dived, and raised Harry could judge empty hand to free Harry could judge. It was not weed: The chain of the Horcrux had tightened and was slowly constricting Harry could judge windpipe. ",
        "Harry kicked out wildly, trying to push Harry back to the surface, but merely propelled Harry into the rocky side of the pool. Thrashing, suffocating, Harry scrabbled at The chain of the Horcrux, Harry frozen fingers unable to loosen The chain of the Horcrux, and now little lights were popping inside his head, and Harry was going to drown, there was nothing left, nothing Harry could do, and the arms that closed around Harry chest were surely Death's. ... ",
        "Choking and retching, soaking and colder than Harry had ever been in Harry life, Harry came to facedown in the snow. Somewhere close by, another person was panting and coughing and staggering around. Hermione had come again, as another person had come when the snake attacked. ... Yet the snake did not sound like another person, not with those deep coughs, not judging by the weight of the footsteps. ... ",
        "Harry had no strength to lift his head and see Harry savior's identity. All Harry could do was raise a shaking hand to Harry throat and feel the place where the locket had cut tightly into Harry flesh. It was gone: Someone had cut Harry free. Then a panting voice spoke from over his head. ",
        "\"Are -- you -- mental?\" ",
        "Nothing but the shock of hearing a panting voice could have given Harry the strength to get up. Shivering violently, Harry staggered to Harry's feet. There before Harry stood Ron, fully dressed but drenched to the skin, Harry hair plastered to Harry face, the sword of Gryffindor in one hand and the Horcrux dangling from Horcrux broken chain in the other. ",
        "\"Why the hell,\" panted Ron, holding up the Horcrux, which swung backward and forward on Horcrux shortened chain in some parody of hypnosis, \"didn't you take this thing off before you dived?\" ",
        "Harry could not answer. DOE ",
        " was nothing, nothing compared with Ron's reappearance; Ron could not believe DOE ",
        ". Shuddering with cold, Ron caught up the pile of clothes still lying at the water's edge and began to pull the pile of clothes still lying at the water's edge on. As Ron dragged sweater after sweater over Ron , Harry stared at Ron, half expecting Ron to have disappeared every time Ron lost sight of Ron, and yet Ron had to be real: Ron had just dived into the pool, Ron had saved Harry's life. ",
        "\"It was y-you?\" Harry said at last, his teeth chattering, a panting voice weaker than usual due to Harry near-strangulation. ",
        "\"Well, yeah,\" said Ron, looking slightly confused. \"Y-you cast DOE ",
        "?\" ",
        "\"What? No, of course not! I thought DOE ",
        " was you doing DOE ",
        "!\" ",
        "\"My Patronus is a stag.\" ",
        "\"Oh yeah. I thought DOE ",
        " looked different. No antlers.\" ",
        "Harry put Hagrid's pouch back around his neck, pulled on a final sweater, stooped to pick up Hermione's wand, and faced Ron again. ",
        "\"How come you're here?\" ",
        "Ron had hoped that this point would come up later, if at all. ",
        "\"Well, I've -- you know -- I've come back. If -- \" Ron cleared Ron . \"You know. You still want me.\" ",
        "There was a pause, in which the subject of Ron's departure seemed to rise like a wall between them. ",
        "Yet Ron was here. Ron had returned. Ron had just saved Harry's life. ",
        "Ron looked down at Ron hands. Ron seemed momentarily surprised to see the things Ron was holding. ",
        "\"Oh yeah, I got it out,\" Ron said, rather unnecessarily, holding up a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt. \"That's why you jumped in, right?\" ",
        "\"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"But I don't understand. How did you get here? How did you find us?\" ",
        "\"Long story,\" said Ron. \"I've been looking for Ron for hours, it's a big forest, isn't it? And I was just thinking I'd have to kip under a tree and wait for morning when I saw that deer coming and you following.\" ",
        "\"You didn't see anyone else?\" ",
        "\"No,\" said Ron. \"I -- \" ",
        "But Ron hesitated, glancing at two trees growing close together some yards away. ",
        "\"I did think I saw something move over there, but I was running to the pool at the time, because you'd gone in and you hadn't come up, so I wasn't going to make a detour to -- hey!\" ",
        "Harry was already hurrying to the place Ron had indicated. The two oaks grew close together; there was a gap of only a few inches between the trunks at eye level, an ideal place to see but not be seen. The ground around the roots, however, was free of snow, and Harry could see no sign of footprints. Harry walked ",
        "back to where Ron stood waiting, still holding the sword and the Horcrux. ",
        "\"Anything there?\" Ron asked. ",
        "\"No,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"So how did a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt get in the pool?\" ",
        "\"Whoever cast the Patronus must have put the Patronus there.\" ",
        "They both looked at a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt, a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt rubied hilt glinting a little in the light from her wand. ",
        "\"You reckon this is the real one?\" asked Ron. ",
        "\"One way to find out, isn't there?\" said Harry. ",
        "the Horcrux was still swinging from Ron's hand. the locket was twitching slightly. Harry knew that the thing inside the locket was agitated again. the locket had sensed the presence of a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt and had tried to kill Harry rather than let Harry possess the presence of the sword. Now was not the time for long discussions; now was the moment to destroy the locket once and for all. Harry looked around, holding Hermione's wand high, and saw the place: a flattish rock lying in the shadow of a sycamore tree. ",
        "\"Come here,\" Harry said, and Harry led the way, brushed snow from the rock's surface, and held out Harry hand for the Horcrux. When Ron offered a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt, however, Harry shook Ron head. ",
        "\"No, you should do it.\" ",
        "\"Me?\" said Ron, looking shocked. \"Why?\" ",
        "\"Because you got a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt out of the pool. I think it's supposed to be you.\" ",
        "Harry was not being kind or generous. As certainly as Harry had known that the doe was benign, Harry knew that Ron had to be the one to wield a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt. ",
        "Dumbledore had at least taught Harry something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable power of certain acts. ",
        "\"I'm going to open it,\" said Harry, \"and you stab it. Straightaway, okay? Because whatever's in there will put up a fight. The bit of Riddle in the diary tried to kill me.\" ",
        "\"How are you going to open it?\" asked Ron. Ron looked terrified. ",
        "\"I'm going to ask it to open, using Parseltongue,\" said Harry. The answer came so readily to Harry lips that Harry thought that Harry had always known it deep down: Perhaps it had taken Harry recent encounter with Nagini to make Harry realize it. Harry looked at the serpentine S, inlaid with glittering green stones: It was easy to visualize It as a minuscule snake, curled upon the cold rock. ",
        "\"No!\" said Ron. \"No, don't open It! I'm serious!\" ",
        "\"Why not?\" asked Harry. \"Let's get rid of the damn thing, it's been months -- \" ",
        "\"I can't, Harry, I'm serious -- you do it -- \" ",
        "\"But why?\" ",
        "\"Because that thing's bad for me!\" said Ron, backing away from the locket on the cold rock. \"I can't handle it! ",
        "I'm not making excuses, Harry, for what I was like, but it affects me worse than it affected you and Hermione, it made me think stuff -- stuff I was thinking anyway, but it made everything worse, I  ",
        "can't explain it, and then I'd take it off and I'd get my head on straight again, and then I'd have to put the effing thing back on -- I can't do the effing thing, Harry!\" ",
        "Harry had backed away, the sword dragging at Harry side, shaking Harry head. ",
        "\"You can do the effing thing,\" said Harry, \"you can! You've just got a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt, I know it's supposed to be you who uses a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt. Please, just get rid of a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt, Ron.\" ",
        "The sound of Ron name seemed to act like a stimulant. Ron swallowed, then, still breathing hard through Ron long nose, moved back toward the cold rock. ",
        "\"Tell me when,\" Ron croaked. ",
        "\"On three,\" said Harry, looking back down at the locket and narrowing Harry eyes, concentrating on the letter S, imagining a serpent, while the contents of the locket rattled like a trapped cockroach. It would have been easy to pity It, except that the cut around Harry's neck still burned. ",
        "\"One ... two ... three ... open.\" ",
        "The last word came as a hiss and a snarl and the golden doors of the locket swung wide with a little click. ",
        "Behind both of the glass windows within blinked a living eye, dark and handsome as Tom Riddle's eyes had been before Tom Riddle's turned both of the glass windows scarlet and slit- pupiled. ",
        "\"Stab,\" said Harry, holding the locket steady on the cold rock. ",
        "Ron raised a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt in Ron shaking hands: The point dangled over the frantically swiveling eyes, and Harry gripped the locket tightly, bracing Harry, already imagining blood pouring from the empty windows. ",
        "Then a voice hissed from out of the Horcrux. ",
        "\"I have seen your heart, and your heart is mine.\" ",
        "\"Don't listen to it!\" Harry said harshly. \"Stab it!\" ",
        "\"I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears. All you desire is possible, but all that you dread is also possible. ...\" ",
        "\"Stab!\" shouted Harry; a panting voice echoed off the surrounding trees, the sword point trembled, and Ron gazed down into Tom Riddle's eyes. ",
        "\" Least loved, always, by the mother who craved a daughter . . . Least loved, now, by the girl who prefers your friend . . . Second best, always, eternally overshadowed ...\" ",
        "RonRon, stab it now!\" Harry bellowed: Harry could feel the locket quivering in Harry grip and was scared of what was coming. Ron raised a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt still higher, and as Ron did so, Tom Riddle's eyes gleamed scarlet. ",
        "Out of the locket's two windows, out of Riddle's eyes, there bloomed, like two grotesque bubbles, the heads of Harry and Hermione, weirdly distorted. ",
        "Ron yelled in shock and backed away as the figures blossomed out of the locket, first chests, then waists, then legs, until they stood in the locket, side by side like trees with a common root, swaying over Ron and the real Harry, who had snatched Ron fingers away from the locket as the locket burned, suddenly, white-hot.  ",
        "RonRon!\" he shouted, but Harry was now speaking with Voldemort's voice and Ron was gazing, mesmerized, into Voldemort's voice face. ",
        "\" Why return? We were better without you, happier without you, glad of your absence. . . . We laughed at your stupidity, your cowardice, your presumption -- \" ",
        "\" Presumption?' echoed the Riddle-Hermione, who was more beautiful and yet more terrible than the real Hermione: the real Hermione swayed, cackling, before Ron, who looked horrified yet transfixed, a sword with glittering rubies in its hilthis side. \" Who could look at you, who would ever look at you, beside Harry Potter? What have you ever done, compared with the Chosen One? What are you, compared with the Boy Who Lived?\" ",
        "\"Ron, stab it, STAB it!\" Harry yelled, but Ron did not move: Ron eyes were wide, and the Riddle-Harry and the Riddle-Hermione were reflected in the Riddle-Harry and the Riddle-Hermione, the Riddle-Harry and the Riddle-Hermione hair swirling like flames, the Riddle-Harry and the Riddle-Hermione shining red, the Riddle-Harry and the Riddle-Hermione voices lifted in an evil duet. ",
        "\" Your mother confessed,\" sneered Harry, while Riddle-Hermione jeered, \"that Your mother would have preferred me as a son, would be glad to exchange ...\" ",
        "\"Who wouldn't prefer Ron, what woman would take you, you are nothing, nothing, nothing to Ron,\" crooned Riddle-Hermione, and what woman stretched like a snake and entwined what woman around Harry, wrapping Ron in a close embrace: Their lips met. ",
        "On the ground in front of Their, Ron's face filled with anguish. Ron raised a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt high, Ron arms shaking. ",
        "\"Do it, Ron!\" Harry yelled. ",
        "Ron looked toward Ron, and Harry thought Ron saw a trace of scarlet in His eyes. ",
        "\"Ron -- ?\" ",
        "a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt flashed, plunged: Harry threw Harry out of the way, there was a clang of metal and a long, drawn-out scream. Harry whirled around, slipping in the snow, wand held ready to defend Harry: but there was nothing to fight. ",
        "The monstrous versions of Harry and Hermione were gone: There was Ron, standing there with a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt in his hand, looking down at the shattered remains of the locket on the flat rock. ",
        "Slowly, Harry walked back to his, hardly knowing what to say or do. his was breathing heavily: his eyes were no longer red at all, but His eyes normal blue; His eyes were also wet. ",
        "Harry stooped, pretending Harry had not seen, and picked up the broken Horcrux. his had pierced the glass in both windows: Riddle's eyes were gone, and the stained silk lining of the locket on the flat rock was smoking slightly. The thing that had lived in the broken Horcrux had vanished; torturing his had been the broken Horcrux final act. ",
        "The sword clanged as his dropped The sword. The sword had sunk to The sword knees, The sword head in The sword arms. The sword was shaking, but not, Harry realized, from cold. Harry crammed the locket on the flat rock into The sword pocket, knelt down beside his, and placed a hand cautiously on his shoulder. his took it as a good sign that his did not throw it off. ",
        "\"After you left,\" his said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that his's face was hidden, \"she cried for a week. Probably longer, only she didn't want me to see. There ",
        "were loads of nights when we never even spoke to each other. With you gone ...\" ",
        "his could not finish; it was only now that his was here again that Harry fully realized how much Harry absence had cost them. ",
        "\"She's like my sister,\" Harry went on. \"I love She like a sister and I reckon She feels the same way about me. It's always been like that. I thought you knew.\" ",
        "his did not respond, but turned Ron's face away from Harry and wiped his nose noisily on his sleeve. Harry got to Harry feet again and walked to where his's enormous rucksack lay yards away, discarded as his had run toward the pool to save Harry from drowning. Harry hoisted his feet onto Harry own back and walked back to Ron, who clambered to his feet as Harry approached, eyes bloodshot but otherwise composed. ",
        "\"I'm sorry,\" Harry said in a thick voice. \"I'm sorry I left. I know I was a -- a -- \" ",
        "Harry looked around at the darkness, as if hoping a bad enough word would swoop down upon Harry and claim Harry. ",
        "\"You've sort of made up for it tonight,\" said Harry. \"Getting the sword. Finishing off the Horcrux. Saving my life.\" ",
        "\"That makes me sound a lot cooler than I was,\" his mumbled. ",
        "\"Stuff like that always sounds cooler than it really was,\" said Harry. \"I've been trying to tell you that for years.\" ",
        "Simultaneously they walked forward and hugged, Harry gripping the still-sopping back of his's jacket. ",
        "\"And now,\" said Harry as they broke apart, \"all we've got to do is find the tent again.\" ",
        "But it was not difficult. Though the walk through the dark forest with the doe had seemed lengthy, with his by his side the journey back seemed to take a surprisingly short time. Harry could not wait to wake Hermione, and it was with quickening excitement that Harry entered the tent, his lagging a little behind his. ",
        "It was gloriously warm after the pool and the forest, the only illumination the bluebell flames still shimmering in a bowl on the floor. Hermione was fast asleep, curled up under her blankets, and did not move until Harry had said her name several times. ",
        "\"Hermionel\" ",
        "her stirred, then sat up quickly, pushing her hair out of her face. ",
        "\"What's wrong? Harry? Are you all right?\" ",
        "\"It's okay, everything's fine. More than fine. I'm great. There's someone here.\" ",
        "\"What do you mean? Who -- ?\" ",
        "her saw Ron, who stood there holding the sword and dripping onto the threadbare carpet. Harry backed into a shadowy corner, slipped off his's rucksack, and attempted to blend in with the canvas. ",
        "Hermione slid out of her bunk and moved like a sleepwalker toward his, her eyes upon his pale face. her stopped right in front of his, her lips slightly ",
        "parted, her eyes wide. his gave a weak, hopeful smile and half raised his arms. ",
        "Hermione launched Hermione forward and started punching every inch of his that Hermione could reach. ",
        "\"Ouch -- ow -- gerroff! What the -- ? Hermione -- OW!\" ",
        "\"You -- complete -- arse -- Ronald -- Weasley!\" ",
        "Hermione punctuated every word with a blow: his backed away, shielding his head as Hermione advanced. ",
        "\"You -- crawl -- back -- here -- after -- weeks -- and -- weeks -- oh, where's my wand?\" ",
        "Hermione looked as though ready to wrestle it out of Harry's hands and Harry reacted instinctively. ",
        "\"Protegol\" ",
        "The invisible shield erupted between his and Hermione: The force of it knocked Hermione backward onto the floor. Spitting hair out of Hermione mouth, Hermione leapt up again. ",
        "Hermione!\" said Harry. \"Calm -- \" ",
        "\"I will not calm down!\" Hermione screamed. Never before had Harry seen Hermione lose control like this; Hermione looked quite demented. \"Give me back my wand! Give it back to me\\\" ",
        "\"Hermione, will you please -- \" ",
        "\"Don't you tell me what to do, Harry Potter!\" Hermione screeched. \"Don't you dare! Give it back now! And YOU!\" ",
        "Hermione was pointing at his in dire accusation: It was like a malediction, and Harry could not blame his for retreating several steps. ",
        "\"I came running after his! I called you! I begged you to come back!\" ",
        "\"I know,\" his said, me\\\" ",
        "\"Hermione, I'm sorry, I'm really -- ",
        "\"Oh, you're sorry!\" ",
        "Hermione laughed, a high-pitched, out-of-control sound; his looked at Harry for help, but Harry merely grimaced Harry helplessness. ",
        "\"You come back after weeks -- weeks -- and you think it's all going to be all right if you just say sorry?\" ",
        "\"Well, what else can I say?\" his shouted, and Harry was glad that his was fighting back. ",
        "\"Oh, I don't know!\" yelled Hermione with awful sarcasm. \"Rack your brains, his, that should only take a couple of seconds -- \" ",
        "\"Hermione,\" interjected Harry, who considered this a low blow, \"his just saved my -- \" ",
        "\"I don't care!\" Hermione screamed. \"I don't care what his's done! Weeks and weeks, we could have been dead for all his knew -- \" ",
        "\"I knew you weren't dead!\" bellowed his, drowning Hermione voice for the first time, and approaching as close as his could with the Shield Charm between them. \"Harry's all over the Prophet, all over the radio, them're looking for Harry everywhere, all these rumors and  ",
        "mental stories, I knew I'd hear straight off if you were dead, you don't know what it's been like -- \" ",
        "\"What it's been like for you?\" ",
        "her voice was now so shrill only bats would be able to hear her voice soon, but Hermione had reached a level of indignation that rendered Hermione temporarily speechless, and his seized his opportunity. ",
        "\"I wanted to come back the minute I'd Disapparated, but I walked straight into a gang of Snatchers, Hermione, and I couldn't go anywhere!\" ",
        "\"A gang of what?\" asked Harry, as Hermione threw Hermione down into a chair with Hermione arms and legs crossed so tightly it seemed unlikely that Hermione would unravel them for several years. ",
        "\"Snatchers,\" said his. \"They're everywhere -- gangs trying to earn gold by rounding up Muggle-borns and blood traitors, there's a reward from the Ministry for everyone captured. I was on my own and I look like I might be school age; They got really excited, thought I was a Muggle-born in hiding. I had to talk fast to get out of being dragged to the Ministry.\" ",
        "\"What did you say to They?\" ",
        "\"Told They I was Stan Shunpike. First person I could think of.\" ",
        "\"And They believed that?\" ",
        "\"They weren't the brightest. One of They was definitely part troll, the smell off Stan Shunpike. ...\" ",
        "his glanced at Hermione, clearly hopeful Hermione might soften at this small instance of humor, but Hermione ",
        "expression remained stony above Hermione tightly knotted limbs. ",
        "\"Anyway, They had a row about whether I was Stan or not. It was a bit pathetic to be honest, but there were still five of They and only one of me and They'd taken my wand. Then two of They got into a fight and while the others were distracted I managed to hit the one holding me in the stomach, grabbed my wand, Disarmed the bloke holding mine, and Disapparated. ",
        "I didn't do it so well, Splinched me again\" -- his held up his right hand to show two missing fingernails; Hermione raised Hermione eyebrows coldly -- \"and I came out miles from where you were. By the time I got back to that bit of riverbank where we'd been ... you'd gone.\" ",
        "\"Gosh, what a gripping story,\" Hermione said in the lofty voice Hermione adopted when wishing to wound. \"You must have been simply terrified. Meanwhile we went to Godric's Hollow and, let's think, what happened there, Harry? Oh yes, You-Know- Who's snake turned up, Who's snake nearly killed both of we, and then You-Know- Who Harry arrived and missed we by about a second.\" ",
        "\"What?\" his said, gaping from Hermione to Harry, but Hermione ignored Harry. ",
        "\"Imagine losing fingernails, Harry! That really puts we sufferings into perspective, doesn't it?\" ",
        "\"Hermione,\" said Harry quietly, his his just saved my life.\" ",
        "Hermione appeared not to have heard his. ",
        "\"One thing I would like to know, though,\" Hermione said, fixing Hermione eyes on a spot a foot over his's head. \"How ",
        "exactly did you find we tonight? That's important. ",
        "Once we know, we'll be able to make sure we're not visited by anyone else we don't want to see.\" ",
        "his glared at Hermione, then pulled a small silver object from his jeans pocket. ",
        "\"This.\" ",
        "Hermione had to look at his to see what his was showing them. ",
        "\"The Deluminator?\" Hermione asked, so surprised Hermione forgot to look cold and fierce. ",
        "\"It doesn't just turn the lights on and off,\" said his. \"I don't know how it works or why it happened then and not any other time, because I've been wanting to come back ever since I left. But I was listening to the radio really early on Christmas morning and I heard ... I heard you.\" ",
        "his was looking at Hermione. ",
        "\"You heard me on the radio?\" Hermione asked incredulously. ",
        "\"No, I heard you coming out of my pocket. Your voice,\" his held up \"The Deluminator again, \"came out of this.\" ",
        "\"And what exactly did I say?\" asked Hermione, Hermione tone somewhere between skepticism and curiosity. ",
        "\"My name. 'his And you said ... something about a wand. ...\" ",
        "Hermione turned a fiery shade of scarlet. Harry remembered: It had been the first time his's name ",
        "had been said aloud by either of them since the day Harry had left; Hermione had mentioned It when talking about repairing Harry's wand. ",
        "\"So I took It out,his his went on, looking at \"The Deluminator, \"and It didn't seem different or anything, but I was sure I'd heard you. So I clicked It. And the light went out in my room, but another light appeared right outside the window.\" ",
        "his raised his empty hand and pointed in front of his, his eyes focused on something neither Ron and Hermione could see. ",
        "\"It was a ball of light, kind of pulsing, and bluish, like that light you get around a Portkey, you know?\" ",
        "\"Yeah,\" said Harry and Hermione together automatically. ",
        "\"I knew this was it,\" said his. \"I grabbed my stuff and packed my stuff, then I put on my rucksack and went out into the garden. ",
        "\"The little ball of light was hovering there, waiting for me, and when I came out The little ball of light bobbed along a bit and I followed The little ball of light behind the shed and then The little ball of light ... well, The little ball of light went inside me.\" ",
        "\"Sorry?\" said Harry, sure Harry had not heard correctly. ",
        "\"It sort of floated toward me,\" said his, illustrating the movement with his free index finger, \"right to my chest, and then -- It just went straight through. It was here,\" his touched a point close to his heart, \"I could feel it, it was hot. And once it was inside me I knew what I was supposed to do, I knew it would take me where I needed to go. So I Disapparated and came ",
        "out on the side of a hill. There was snow everywhere. ",
        "\"We were there,\" said Harry. \"We spent two nights there, and the second night I kept thinking I could hear someone moving around in the dark and calling out!\" ",
        "\"Yeah, well, that would've been me,\" said his. \"Your protective spells work, anyway, because I couldn't see you and I couldn't hear you. I was sure you were around, though, so in the end I got in my sleeping bag and waited for one of you to appear. I thought you'd have to show yourselves when you packed up the tent.\" ",
        "\"No, actually,\" said Hermione. \"We've been Disapparating under the Invisibility Cloak as an extra precaution. And We left really early, because, as Harry says, We'd heard somebody blundering around.\" ",
        "\"Well, I stayed on that hill all day,\" said his. \"I kept hoping you'd appear. But when it started to get dark I knew I must have missed you, so I clicked \"The Deluminator again, the blue light came out and went inside me, and I Disapparated and arrived here in these woods. I still couldn't see you, so I just had to hope one of me would show yourselves in the end -- and Harry did. Well, I saw the doe first, obviously.\" ",
        "\"You saw the what?\" said Hermione sharply. ",
        "They explained what had happened, and as the story of the doe and the sword in the pool unfolded, Hermione frowned from one to the other of They, concentrating so hard Hermione forgot to keep Hermione limbs locked together. ",
        "\"But it must have been a Patronus!\" Hermione said. \"Couldn't you see who was casting it? Didn't you see anyone? And it led you to the sword! I can't believe this! Then what happened?his his explained how his had watched Harry jump into the pool and had waited for his to resurface; how his had realized that something was wrong, dived in, and saved Harry, then returned for the sword. his got as far as the opening of the locket, then hesitated, and Harry cut in. ",
        "\" -- and his stabbed it with the sword.\" ",
        "\"And ... and it went? Just like that?\" she whispered. ",
        "\"Well, it -- it screamed,\" said Harry with half a glance at his. \"Here.\" ",
        "his threw the locket into the locket lap; gingerly the locket picked the locket up and examined the locket punctured windows. ",
        "Deciding that the locket was at last safe to do so, Harry removed the Shield Charm with a wave of Hermione's wand and turned to his. ",
        "\"Did you just say you got away from the Snatchers with a spare wand?\" ",
        "\"What?\" said Ron, who had been watching Hermione examining the locket. \"Oh -- oh yeah.\" ",
        "his tugged open a buckle on his rucksack and pulled a short, dark wand out of his rucksack pocket. \"Here. I figured it's always handy to have a backup.\" ",
        "\"You were right,\" said Harry, holding out Harry hand. \"Mine's broken.\" ",
        "\"You're kidding?\" his said, but at that moment Hermione got to Hermione feet, and his looked apprehensive again. ",
        "Hermione put the vanquished Horcrux into the beaded bag, then climbed back into Hermione bed and settled down without another word. ",
        "his passed Harry my wand. ",
        "\"About the best you could hope for, I think,\" murmured Harry. ",
        "\"Yeah,\" said his. \"Could've been worse. Remember those birds she set on me?\" ",
        "\"I still haven't ruled it out,\" came Hermione's muffled voice from beneath she blankets, but Harry saw his smiling slightly as Harry pulled Harry maroon pajamas out of his rucksack. ",
        "XEN OPHILIUS LOVEGOOD ",
        "Harry had not expected Hermione's anger to abate overnight, and was therefore unsurprised that Harry communicated mainly by dirty looks and pointed silences the next morning. his responded by maintaining an unnaturally somber demeanor in Harry presence as an outward sign of continuing remorse. ",
        "In fact, when all three of them were together Harry felt like the only non-mourner at a poorly attended funeral. During those few moments Harry spent alone with Harry, however (collecting water and searching the undergrowth for mushrooms), his became shamelessly cheery. ",
        "\"Someone helped us,\" Harry kept saying. \"Someone sent the doe. Someone's on us side. One Horcrux down, mate!\" ",
        "Bolstered by the destruction of the locket, they set to debating the possible locations of the other Horcruxes, and even though they had discussed the matter so often before, Harry felt optimistic, certain that more breakthroughs would succeed the first. ",
        "Hermione's sulkiness could not mar Hermione's sulkiness buoyant spirits: The sudden upswing in their fortunes, the appearance of the mysterious doe, the recovery of Gryffindor's sword, and above all, his's return, made Harry so happy that it was quite difficult to maintain a straight face. ",
        "Late in the afternoon Harry and his escaped Hermione's baleful presence again, and under the pretense of scouring the bare hedges for nonexistent blackberries, he and Ron continued he and Ron ongoing exchange of news. Harry had finally managed to tell his the whole story of his and Hermione's various wanderings, right up to the full story of what had happened at Godric's Hollow; his was now filling Harry in on everything his had discovered about the wider Wizarding world during his weeks away. ",
        "\"... and how did you find out about the Taboo?\" his asked Harry after explaining the many desperate attempts of Muggle-borns to evade the Ministry. ",
        "\"The what?\" ",
        "\"You and Hermione have stopped saying You-Know- Who's name!\" ",
        "\"Oh, yeah. Well, it's just a bad habit we've slipped into,\" said Harry. \"But I haven't got a problem calling Harry V -- \" ",
        "\"NO!\" roared his, causing Harry to jump into the hedge and Hermione (nose buried in a book at the tent entrance) to scowl over at the hedge and Hermione. \"Sorry,\" said his, wrenching Harry back out of the brambles, \"but the name's been jinxed, Harry, that's how the hedge and Hermione track people! Using Harry name breaks protective enchantments, his name causes some kind of magical ",
        "disturbance -- it's how the hedge and Hermione found us in Tottenham Court Road!\" ",
        "\"Because us used Harry name?\" ",
        "\"Exactly! You've got to give the hedge and Hermione credit, it makes sense. It was only people who were serious about standing up to him, like Dumbledore, who ever dared use it. Now they've put a Taboo on a Taboo, anyone who says a Taboo is trackable -- quick-and-easy way to find Order members! they nearly got Kingsley -- \" ",
        "\"You're kidding?\" ",
        "\"Yeah, a bunch of Death Eaters cornered Kingsley -- \" ",
        ", Bill said, but Bill fought Bill way out. Bill's on the run now, just like us.\" his scratched his chin thoughtfully with the end of the wand. \"You don't reckon Kingsley could have sent the doe?\" ",
        "\"Kingsley Patronus is a lynx, us saw His Patronus at the wedding, remember?\" ",
        "\"Oh yeah ...\" ",
        "they moved farther along the hedge, away from the tent and Hermione. ",
        "\"Harry ... you don't reckon it could've been Dumbledore?\" ",
        "\"Dumbledore?his his looked a little embarrassed, but said in a low voice, \"Dumbledore ... the doe? I mean,\" his was watching Harry out of the corners of his eyes, \"his had the real sword last, didn't his?\" ",
        "Harry did not laugh at his, because his understood too well the longing behind the question. The idea that Dumbledore had managed to come back to them, that his was watching over them, would have been inexpressibly comforting. his shook his head. ",
        "\"Dumbledore's dead,\" his said. \"I saw it happen, I saw the body. his's definitely gone. Anyway, His Patronus was a phoenix, not a doe.\" ",
        "\"Patronuses can change, though, can't they?\" said his. \"Tonks's changed, didn't it?\" ",
        "\"Yeah, but if Dumbledore was alive, why wouldn't Dumbledore show Dumbledore? Why wouldn't Dumbledore just hand us the real sword?\" ",
        "\"Search me,\" said his. \"Same reason Dumbledore didn't give it to you while Dumbledore was alive? Same reason Dumbledore left you an old Snitch and Hermione a book of kids' stories?\" ",
        "\"Which is what?\" asked Harry, turning to look his full in the face, desperate for the answer. ",
        "\"I dunno,\" said his. \"Sometimes I've thought, when I've been a bit hacked off, his was having a laugh or -- or his just wanted to make it more difficult. But I don't think so, not anymore. his knew what his was doing when his gave me \"The Deluminator, didn't his? his -- well,\" his's ears turned bright red and his became engrossed in a tuft of grass at his feet, which his prodded with his toe, \"his must've known I'd run out on you.\" ",
        "\"No,\" Harry corrected his. \"his must've known you'd always want to come back.\" ",
        "his looked grateful, but still awkward. Partly to change the subject, Harry said, \"Speaking of ",
        "Dumbledore, have you heard what Skeeter wrote about ",
        "Dumbledore?\" ",
        "\"Oh yeah,\" said his at once, \"people are talking about it quite a lot. 'Course, if things were different, it'd be huge news, Dumbledore being pals with Grindelwald, but now it's just something to laugh about for people who didn't like Dumbledore, and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone who thought ",
        "Dumbledore was such a good bloke. I don't know that it's such a big deal, though. ",
        "Dumbledore was really young when they -- \" ",
        "\"they age,\" said Harry, just as ",
        "Dumbledore had retorted to Hermione, and something in ",
        "Dumbledore face seemed to decide his against pursuing the subject. ",
        "A large spider sat in the middle of a frosted web in the brambles. Harry took aim at A large spider with the wand his had given Harry the previous night, which Hermione had since condescended to examine, and had decided was made of blackthorn. ",
        "\"Engorgio.\" ",
        "A large spider gave a little shiver, bouncing slightly in the web. Harry tried again. This time A large spider grew slightly larger. ",
        "\"Stop that,\" said his sharply. \"I'm sorry I said Dumbledore was young, okay?\" ",
        "Harry had forgotten his's hatred of spiders. ",
        "\"Sorry -- Reducio.\" ",
        "A large spider did not shrink. Harry looked down at the wand. Every minor spell Harry had cast with it so far that day had seemed less powerful than those Harry had produced with the wand. The new one ",
        "felt intrusively unfamiliar, like having somebody else's hand sewn to the end of Harry arm. ",
        "\"You just need to practice,\" said Hermione, who had approached them noiselessly from behind and had stood watching anxiously as Harry tried to enlarge and reduce A large spider. \"It's all a matter of confidence, Harry.\" ",
        "Harry knew why she wanted it to be all right: she still felt guilty about breaking the wand. Harry bit back the retort that sprang to Harry lips, that she could take the wand if she thought the wand made no difference, and Harry would have hers instead. Keen for them all to be friends again, however, Harry agreed; but when his gave Hermione a tentative smile, Hermione stalked off and vanished behind Hermione book once more. ",
        "All three of them returned to the tent when darkness fell, and Harry took first watch. Sitting in the entrance, Harry tried to make the blackthorn wand levitate small stones at Harry feet; but Harry magic still seemed clumsier and less powerful than his magic had done before. Hermione was lying on Hermione bunk reading, while his, after many nervous glances up at Hermione, had taken a small wooden wireless out of his rucksack and started to try and tune it. ",
        "\"There's this one program,\" his told Harry in a low voice, \"that tells the news like the news really is. All the others are on You- Know- Who's side and are following the Ministry line, but this one ... you wait till you hear it, it's great. Only they can't do it every night, they have to keep changing locations in case they're raided, and you need a password to tune in. ... ",

        "He drummed lightly on the top of the radio with He , muttering random words under He breath. He ",
        "threw Hermione many covert glances, plainly fearing an angry outburst, but for all the notice she took of He He might not have been there. For ten minutes or so his tapped and muttered, Hermione turned the pages of she , and Harry continued to practice with the wand. ",
        "Hermione climbed down from she bunk. his ceased his tapping at once. ",
        "\"If it's annoying you, 111 stop!\" his told Hermione nervously. ",
        "Hermione did not deign to respond, but approached Harry. ",
        "\"We need to talk,\" she said. ",
        "his looked at her bookshe . It was The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore. ",
        "\"What?\" his said apprehensively. It flew through his mind that there was a chapter on his in there; his was not sure his felt up to hearing Rita's version of his relationship with Dumbledore. Hermione 's answer, however, was completely unexpected. ",
        "\"I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood.\" ",
        "his stared at she. ",
        "\"Sorry?\" ",
        "\"Xenophilius Lovegood. Luna. I want to go and talk to Luna!\" ",
        "\"Er -- why?\" ",
        "she took a deep breath, as though bracing she, and said, \"It's that mark, the mark in Beedle the Bard. Look at this!\" ",
        "she thrust The Life and Lies ofAlbus Dumbledore under Harry's unwilling eyes and The Life and Lies ofAlbus Dumbledore under Harry's unwilling eyes saw a photograph of the original letter that Dumbledore had written Grindelwald, with Dumbledore 's familiar thin, slanting handwriting. The Life and Lies ofAlbus Dumbledore under Harry's unwilling eyes hated seeing absolute proof that Dumbledore really had written those words, that they had not been Rita's invention. ",
        "\"The signature,\" said Hermione. \"Look at the signature, Harry!\" ",
        "Harry obeyed. For a moment Harry had no idea what she was talking about, but, looking more closely with the aid of the wand, Harry saw that Dumbledore had replaced the A of Albus with a tiny version of the same triangular mark inscribed upon The Tales of Beedle the Bard. ",
        "\"Er -- what are you -- ?\" said his tentatively, but Hermione quelled his with a look and turned back to Harry. ",
        "\"It keeps cropping up, doesn't It?\" she said. \"I know Viktor said it was Grindelwald 's mark, but it was definitely on that old grave in Godric's Hollow, and the dates on the headstone were long before Grindelwald came along! And now this! Well, we can't ask Dumbledore or Grindelwald what it means -- I don't even know whether Grindelwald's still alive -- but we can ask \" ",
        "\"Xenophilius Lovegood. \" ",

I reckon Old Lovegood told us the truth, or what Old Lovegood thinks is the truth, just to keep us talking.\" ",
        "\"Well, I don't suppose it matters,\" sighed Hermione. \"Even if Old Lovegood was being honest, I never heard such a lot of nonsense in all my life.\" ",

        "\"I don't know. us could do with an unbeatable wand,\" said Harry, turning an unbeatable wand Harry so disliked over in Harry fingers. ",
        "\"There's no such thing, Harry!\" ",
        "\"You said there have been loads of wands -- the Deathstick and whatever they were called -- \" ",
        "\"All right, even if you want to kid yourself the Elder Wand's real, what about the Resurrection Stone?\" Her fingers sketched quotation marks around the name, and Her tone dripped sarcasm. \"No magic can raise the dead, and that's that!\" ",

        "\"But my mum and dad weren't really back from the dead, were my mum and dad?\" said Hermione. \"Those kinds of -- of pale imitations aren't the same as truly bringing someone back to life.\" ",
        "\"But she, the girl in the tale, didn't really come back, did she? A story about how humans are frightened of death says that once people are dead, people belong with the dead.

        "the second brother saw concern and something less easily definable in Hermione's expression. Then, as she glanced at his, Harry realized that it was fear: Harry had scared she with Harry talk of living with dead people. ",

I borrowed A Wizarding Genealogy from Kreacher,\" A Wizarding Genealogy explained as his raised his eyebrows. \"A Wizarding Genealogy lists the pure-blood families that are now extinct in the male line.

        "And then it came to Harry in one shining piece, the memory that had stirred at the sound of the name \"Peverell\": a filthy old man brandishing an ugly ring in the face of a Ministry official, and Harry cried aloud, \"Marvolo Gaunt!\" ",

        "\"Marvolo Gaunti You -Know- Who's grandfather! In the Pensieve! With Dumbledore! \"Marvolo Gaunt said \"Marvolo Gaunt was descended from the Peverells!\" ",

        "\"The Peverell coat of arms?\" said Hermione sharply. \"Could you see what it looked like?\" ",

        "\"Blimey ... You reckon it was this sign again? The sign of the Deathly Hallows?\" ",
        "\"Why not?\" said Harry excitedly. \"\"Marvolo Gaunt was an ignorant old git who lived like a pig, all \"Marvolo Gaunt cared about was \"Marvolo Gaunt ancestry.

        "\"Yes ... and that's all very interesting,\" said Hermione cautiously, \"but Harry, if you're thinking what I think you're think -- \" ",
        "\"Well, why not? Why not?\" said Harry, abandoning caution. \"It was a stone, wasn't It?\" \"Marvolo Gaunt looked at his for support. \"What if it was the Resurrection Stonethe Resurrection Stone?\" ",

        "\"A minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the Resurrection Stone properly!\" ",
        "\"Where d'you reckon the ring is now?\" his asked Harry. \"What did Dumbledore do with it after Dumbledore broke it open?\" ",

        "the answer? Hallows versus Horcruxes? Was there a way, after all, to ensure that he was the one who triumphed? If he were the master of the Deathly Hallows, would he be safe? ",
        "\"Harry?\" ",
        "But he scarcely heard Hermione: he had pulled out he and was running the Invisibility Cloak through he fingers, the cloth supple as water, light as air. he had never seen anything to equal it in he nearly seven years in the Wizarding world. the Invisibility Cloak the Invisibility Cloak was exactly what \" ",
        "Xenophilius had described: A cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at the wearer ... ",
        "And then, with a gasp, he remembered -- ",
        "\"Dumbledore had the Invisibility Cloak the night my parents died!\" ",
        "he voice shook and he could feel the color in he face, but he did not care. ",

        "\"Read it,\" he told her, pushing he mother's letter into her hand. \"Read his mother's letter! Dumbledore had the Cloak, Hermione! Why else would Dumbledore want his mother's letter?

The downpour pursued They to the coast, where They pitched the tent that night, and persisted through the whole week, through sodden landscapes that Harry found bleak and depressing. Harry could think only of the Deathly Hallows. It was as though a flame had been lit inside Harry that nothing, not Hermione 's flat disbelief nor his's persistent doubts, could extinguish. And yet the fiercer the longing for the Deathly Hallows burned inside Harry, the less joyful it made Harry. Harry blamed Ron and Hermione ': Ron and Hermione ' determined indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for dampening Harry spirits, but neither could erode Harry certainty, which remained absolute.

Harry sought solitude whenever it happened, but was disappointed by what Harry saw. The visions he and Voldemort were sharing had changed in quality; The visions he and Voldemort were sharing had become blurred, shifting as though The visions he and Voldemort were sharing were moving in and out of focus. Harry was just able to make out the indistinct features of an object that looked like a skull, and something like a mountain that was more shadow than substance.

Harry was worried that the connection between Harry and Voldemort had been damaged, a connection that Harry both feared and, whatever Harry had told Hermione, prized. \" ",

Maybe Harry is, maybe Harry isn't, but the fact remains Harry can move faster than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo when Severus Snape wants to, so don't count on Severus Snape being a long way away if you're planning on taking any risks.

        "Ron stood rigid, clutching That wand. Harry straightened up, still holding Bellatrix's. ",
        "\"I said, drop them!\" Bellatrix screeched, pressing the blade into Hermione's throat: Harry saw beads of blood appear there. ",
        "\"All right!\" Harry shouted, and Harry dropped Bellatrix's wand onto the floor at Bellatrix's feet. Ron did the same with Wormtail's. Both raised Both hands to shoulder height. ",
        "\"Good!\" she leered. \"Draco, pick them up! the Dark Lord is coming, Harry Potter! Your death approaches!\" ",
        "Harry knew Your death; Harry scar was bursting with the pain of Your death, and Harry could feel Voldemort flying through the sky from far away, over a dark and stormy sea, and soon Harry would be close enough to Apparate to them, and Harry could see no way out. ",
        "\"Now,\" said Bellatrix softly, as Draco hurried back to Draco with the wands, \"Cissy, I think we ought to tie these little heroes up again, while Greyback takes care of Miss Mudblood. I am sure the Dark Lord will not begrudge you the girl, Greyback, after what you have done tonight.\" ",
        "At the last word there was a peculiar grinding noise from above. All of them looked upward in time to see the crystal chandelier tremble; then, with a creak and an ominous jingling, it began to fall. Bellatrix was directly beneath Bellatrix; dropping Hermione, Bellatrix threw Bellatrix aside with a scream. crystal chandelier crashed to the floor in an explosion of crystal and chains, falling on top of Hermione and the goblin, who still clutched the sword of Gryffindor. Glittering shards of crystal flew in all directions: Draco doubled over, Draco hands covering Draco bloody face. ",
        "As Ron ran to pull Hermione out of the wreckage, Harry took Harry chance: Harry leapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands from Draco's grip, pointed all of the three wands at Greyback, and yelled, \"Stupefyl\" The werewolf was lifted off \" The werewolf by the triple spell, flew up to the ceiling, and then smashed to the ground. ",
        "As Narcissa dragged Draco out of the way of further harm, Bellatrix sprang to Bellatrix , Bellatrix hair flying as Bellatrix brandished the silver knife; but Narcissa had directed Bellatrix at the doorway. ",
        "\"Dobby!\" Bellatrix screamed, and even Bellatrix froze. ",
        "\"You! You dropped crystal chandelier -- ?\" ",
        "The tiny elf trotted into the room, The tiny elf shaking finger pointing at The tiny elf old mistress. ",
        "\"You must not hurt Harry Potter,\" Harry Potter squeaked. ",
        "\"Kill Harry Potter, Cissy!\" shrieked Bellatrix, but there was another loud crack, and Narcissa's wand too flew into the air and landed on the other side of the room. ",
        "\"You dirty little monkey!\" bawled Bellatrix. \"How dare you take a witch's wand, how dare you defy your masters?\" ",
        "\"Dobby has no master!\" squealed The tiny elf. \"\"Dobby is a free elf, and \"Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and Harry Potter friends!\" ",
        "Harry's scar was blinding Harry with pain. Dimly The tiny elf knew that Dimly had moments, seconds before Voldemort was with Dimly. ",
        "\"Ron, catch -- and GO!\" The tiny elf yelled, throwing one of the three wands to The tiny elf; then The tiny elf bent down to tug Griphook out from under crystal chandelier. Hoisting the groaning goblin, who still clung to the sword, over one shoulder, Harry seized \"Dobby's hand and spun on the spot to Disapparate. ",
        "As The tiny elf turned into darkness The tiny elf caught one last view of the drawing room: of the pale, frozen figures of Narcissa and Draco, of the streak of red that was Ron's hair, and a blur of flying silver, as Bellatrix's knife flew across the room at the place where The tiny elf was vanishing -- ",
        "Bill and Fleur's . . . Shell Cottage . . . Bill and Fleur's . . . ",
        "The tiny elf had disappeared into the unknown; all The tiny elf could do was repeat the name of the destination and hope ",
        "that it would suffice to take The tiny elf there. The pain in The tiny elf forehead pierced The tiny elf, and the weight of the goblin bore down upon The tiny elf; the goblin could feel the blade of Gryffindor's sword bumping against the goblin back; \"Dobby's hand jerked in the goblin; the goblin wondered whether The tiny elf was trying to take charge, to pull The tiny elf in the right direction, and tried, by squeezing the fingers, to indicate that that was fine with the goblin. ... ",
        "And then they hit solid earth and smelled salty air. Harry fell to Harry knees, relinquished Dobby's hand, and attempted to lower Griphook gently to the ground. ",
        "\"Are you all right?\" Harry said as the goblin stirred, but Griphook merely whimpered. ",
        "Harry squinted around through darkness. There seemed to be a cottage a short way away under the wide starry sky, and Harry thought Harry saw movement outside a cottage. ",
        "\"Dobby, is a cottage?\" Harry whispered, clutching the two wands Harry had brought from the Malfoys', ready to fight if Harry needed to. \"Have we come to the right place? Dobby?\" ",
        "Harry looked around. The tiny elf stood feet from Harry. \"DOBBY!\" ",
        "The tiny elf swayed slightly, stars reflected in Harry wide, shining eyes. Together, Harry and Harry looked down at the silver hilt of the knife protruding from The tiny elf's heaving chest. ",
        "\"Dobby -- no -- HELP!\" Harry bellowed toward Shell Cottage, toward the people moving there. \"HELP!\" ",
        "Harry did not know or care whether they were wizards or Muggles, friends or foes; all Harry cared about was that a dark stain was spreading across Dobby's front, and that Harry had stretched out Harry thin arms to Harry with a look of supplication. Harry caught Harry and laid Harry sideways on the cool grass. ",
        "\"Dobby, no, don't die, don't die -- \" ",
        "The tiny elf's eyes found Harry, and Harry lips trembled with the effort to form words. ",
        "\"Harry ... Potter ...\" ",
        "And then with a little shudder The tiny elf became quite still, and The elf's eyes were nothing more than great glassy orbs, sprinkled with light from the stars The elf's eyes could not see. "

    "THE WANDMAKER": [
        "It was like sinking into an old nightmare; for an instant Harry knelt again beside Dumbledore's body at the foot of the tallest tower at Hogwarts, but in reality Harry was staring at a tiny body curled upon the grass, pierced by Bellatrix's silver knife. Harry's voice was still saying, \"Dobby ... Dobby ...\" even though Harry knew that The tiny elf had gone where Harry could not call Harry back. ",
        "After a minute or so Harry realized that they had, after all, come to the right place, for here were Bill and Fleur, Dean and Luna, gathering around Dean as Dean knelt over The tiny elf. ",
        "\"Hermione?\" Dean said suddenly. \"Where is she?\" ",
        "\"Ron's taken she inside,\" said Bill. \"she'll be all right.\" ",
        "Harry looked back down at \"Dobby. Harry stretched out a hand and pulled the sharp blade from The tiny elf's body, then dragged off Harry own jacket and covered \"Dobby in the sharp blade like a blanket. ",
        "The sea was rushing against rock somewhere nearby; Harry listened to The sea while the others talked, discussing matters in which Harry could take no interest, making decisions. Dean carried the injured Griphook into the house, Fleur hurrying with them; now Bill was making suggestions about burying The tiny elf. Harry agreed without really knowing what Harry was saying. As Harry did so, Harry gazed down at the elf's body, and Harry scar prickled and burned, and in one part of Harry mind, viewed as if from the wrong end of a long telescope, Harry saw Voldemort punishing those they had left behind at Malfoy Manor. Harry rage was dreadful and yet Harry's grief for \"Dobby seemed to diminish Harry's grief for Dobby, so that Harry's grief for Dobby became a distant storm that reached Harry from across a vast, silent ocean. ",
        "\"I want to do Harry's grief for Dobby properly,\" were the first words of which Harry was fully conscious of speaking. \"Not by magic. Have you got a spade?\" ",
        "And shortly afterward Bill had set to work, alone, digging the grave in the place that Bill had shown Bill at the end of the garden, between bushes. Bill dug with a kind of fury, relishing the manual work, glorying in the non-magic of it, for every drop of Bill sweat and every blister felt like a gift to the elf who had saved their lives. ",
        "his scar burned, but Bill was master of the pain; Bill felt it, yet was apart from it. Bill had learned control at last, learned to shut Bill mind to Voldemort, the very thing Dumbledore had wanted Bill to learn from Snape. Just as Voldemort had not been able to possess Harry while Harry was consumed with grief for Sirius, so Harry thoughts could not penetrate Harry now, while Harry mourned \"Dobby. Grief, it seemed, drove Voldemort out ... though Dumbledore, of course, would have said that it was love. ... ",
        "On Harry dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold earth, subsuming Harry grief in sweat, denying the pain in his scar. In darkness, with nothing but the sound of Harry own breath and the rushing sea to keep Harry company, the things that had happened at the Malfoys' returned to Harry, the things Harry had heard came back to Harry, and understanding blossomed in darkness. ... ",
        "The steady rhythm of Harry arms beat time with his thoughts. Hallows ... Horcruxes ... Hallows ... ... Horcruxes ... Yet Harry no longer burned with that weird, obsessive longing. Loss and fear had snuffed it out: ",
        "Harry felt as though Harry had been slapped awake again. ",
        "Deeper and deeper Harry sank into the grave, and Harry knew where Voldemort had been tonight, and whom Harry had killed in the topmost cell of Nurmengard, and why. ... ",
        "And Harry thought of Wormtail, dead because of one small unconscious impulse of mercy. . . . Dumbledore had foreseen that. ... How much more had Dumbledore known? ",
        "Harry lost track of time. Harry knew only that darkness had lightened a few degrees when Harry was rejoined by \"Ron and Dean. ",
        "\"How's \"Hermione?\" ",
        "\"Better,\" said \"Ron. \"Fleur's looking after Fleur.\" ",
        "Harry had Harry retort ready for when they asked Harry why Harry had not simply created a perfect grave with Harry wand, but Harry did not need a perfect grave. they jumped down into the hole Harry had made with spades of they own, and together they worked in silence until the hole seemed deep enough. ",
        "Harry wrapped The tiny elf more snugly in his own jacket. \"Ron sat on the edge of the grave and stripped off \"Ron shoes and socks, which \"Ron placed upon The tiny elf's bare feet. Dean produced a woolen hat, which Harry placed carefully upon Dobby's head, muffling Dean batlike ears. ",
        "\"We should close Dean .\" ",
        "Harry had not heard the others coming through darkness. Bill was wearing a traveling cloak, Fleur a large white apron, from the pocket of which protruded a bottle of what Harry recognized to be Skele-Gro. \"Hermione was wrapped in a borrowed dressing gown, pale and unsteady on \"Hermione feet; \"Ron put an arm around \"Hermione when \"Hermione reached \"Ron. Luna, who was huddled in one of Fleur's coats, crouched down and placed \"Hermione fingers tenderly upon each of The tiny elf's eyelids, sliding The tiny elf over \"Ron glassy stare. ",
        "\"There,\" \"Hermione said softly. \"Now \"Ron could be sleeping.\" ",
        "Harry placed The tiny elf into the grave, arranged \"Ron tiny limbs so that \"Ron might have been resting, then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the elf's body. \"Ron forced \"Ron not to break down as \"Ron remembered Dumbledore's funeral, and the rows and rows of golden chairs, and the Minister of Magic in the front row, the recitation of Dumbledore's achievements, the stateliness of the white marble tomb. \"Ron felt that \"Dobby deserved just as grand a funeral, and yet here The tiny elf lay between bushes in a roughly dug hole. ",
        "\"I think we ought to say something,\" piped up Luna. \"I'll go first, shall I?\" ",
        "And as everybody looked at Luna, Luna addressed The tiny elf at the bottom of the grave. ",
        "\"Thank you so much, \"Dobby, for rescuing me from that cellar. It's so unfair that you had to die, when you were so good and brave. I'll always remember what you did for we. I hope you're happy now.\" ",
        "Luna turned and looked expectantly at Ron, who cleared his throat and said in a thick voice, \"Yeah ... thanks, \"Dobby.\" ",
        "\"Thanks,\" muttered Dean. ",
        "Harry swallowed. ",
        "\"Good-bye, \"Dobby,\" Harry said. It was all Harry could manage, but Luna had said it all for Harry. Bill raised his wand, and the pile of earth beside the grave rose up into the air and fell neatly upon the air, a small, reddish mound. ",
        "\"D'you mind if I stay here a moment?\" Bill asked the others. ",
        "the others murmured words Bill did not catch; Bill felt gentle pats upon Bill back, and then the others traipsed back toward Shell Cottage, leaving Harry alone beside The tiny elf. ",
        "Bill looked around: There were a number of large white stones, smoothed by The sea, marking the edge of the flower beds. Bill picked up one of the largest and laid the largest, pillowlike, over the place where \"Dobby 's head now rested. Bill then felt in Bill pocket for a wand. ",
        "There were two in there. Bill had forgotten, lost track; Bill could not now remember whose wands these were; Bill seemed to remember wrenching these out of someone's hand. Bill selected the shorter of the two, which felt friendlier in someone's hand, and pointed it at the rock. ",
        "Slowly, under Bill murmured instruction, deep cuts appeared upon the rock's surface. Bill knew that \"Hermione could have done it more neatly, and probably more quickly, but Bill wanted to mark the spot as Bill had wanted to dig the grave. When Harry stood up again, the stone read: ",
        "HERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF. ",
        "Harry looked down at Harry handiwork for a few more seconds, then walked away, Harry scar still prickling a little, and Harry mind full of those things that had come to Harry in the grave, ideas that had taken shape in the darkness, ideas both fascinating and terrible. ",
        "They were all sitting in the living room when Harry entered the little hall, They attention focused upon Bill, who was talking. the living room was light-colored, pretty, with a small fire of driftwood burning brightly in the fireplace. Harry did not want to drop mud upon the carpet, so Harry stood in the doorway, listening. ",
        "\"... lucky that Ginny's on holiday. If Ginny'd been at Hogwarts, she'd been at Hogwarts could have taken Ginny before she'd been at Hogwarts reached Ginny. Now she'd been at Hogwarts know Ginny's safe too.\" ",
        "Harry looked around and saw Harry standing there. ",
        "\"I've been getting them all out of the Burrow,\" Harry explained. \"Moved them to Muriel's. The Death Eaters know \"Ron's with you now, The Death Eaters're bound to target the family -- don't apologize,\" \"Ron added at the sight of Harry's expression. \"It was always a matter of time, Dad's been saying so for months. she'd been at Hogwarts're the biggest blood-traitor family there is.\" ",
        "\"How are The Death Eaters protected?\" asked Harry. ",
        "\"Fidelius Charm. Dad's Secret-Keeper. And she'd been at Hogwarts've done it on Shell Cottage too; I'm Secret-Keeper here. None of she'd been at Hogwarts can go to work, but that's hardly the most important thing now. Once Ollivander and Griphook are well enough, she'd been at Hogwarts'll move Ollivander and Griphook to Muriel's too. There isn't much room here, but Muriel's got plenty. Griphook's legs are on the mend, Fleur's given Fleur Skele-Gro; she'd been at Hogwarts could probably move Ollivander and Griphook in an hour ",
        "or -- ",
        "\"No,\" Harry said, and Bill looked startled. \"I need both of Ollivander and Griphook here. I need to talk to both of them. It's important.\" ",
        "Bill heard the authority in Bill own voice, the conviction, the sense of purpose that had come to Bill as Bill dug Dobby's grave. All of their faces were turned toward Bill, looking puzzled. ",
        "\"I'm going to wash,\" Harry told Bill, looking down at Harry hands, still covered in mud and Dobby's blood. \"Then 111 need to see them, straightaway.\" ",
        "Harry walked into the little kitchen, to the basin beneath a window overlooking The sea. Dawn was breaking over the horizon, shell pink and faintly gold, as Harry washed, again following the train of thought that had come to Harry in the dark garden. ... ",
        "\"Dobby would never be able to tell them who had sent Harry to the cellar, but Harry knew what Harry had seen. ",
        "A piercing blue eye had looked out of the mirror fragment, and then help had come. Help will always be given at Hog warts to those who ask for Hog ",
        "Harry dried his hands, impervious to the beauty of the scene outside a window overlooking the sea and to the murmuring of the others in the living room. Harry looked out over the ocean and felt closer, Dawn, than ever before, closer to the heart of it all. ",
        "And still Harry scar prickled, and Harry knew that Voldemort was getting there too. Harry understood and yet did not understand. Harry instinct was telling Harry one thing, Harry brain quite another. Dumbledore smiled, surveying Harry over the tips of Harry fingers, pressed together as if in prayer. ",
        "You gave \"Ron. You understood \"Ron. . . . You gave \"Ron a way back. . . . ",
        "And you understood Wormtail too. ... You knew there was a bit of regret there, somewhere. ... ",
        "And if you knew them ... What did you know about Dumbledore, Dumbledore? ",
        "Am I meant to know, but not to seek? Did you know how hard I'd find that? Is that why you made it this difficult? So I'd have time to work that out? ",
        "Harry stood quite still, eyes glazed, watching the place where a bright gold rim of dazzling sun was rising over the horizon. Then Harry looked down at his hands and was momentarily surprised to see the cloth Harry was holding in his hands. Harry set the cloth he was holding in them down and returned to the hall, and as Harry did so, Harry felt Harry scar pulse angrily, and there flashed across Harry mind, swift as the reflection of a dragonfly over water, the outline of a building Harry knew extremely well.

        "Bill, who was talking were standing at the foot of the stairs. ",
        "\"I need to speak to Griphook and Ollivander,Harry Harry said. ",
        "\"No,\" said Fleur. \"You will 'ave to wait, 'Arry. Zey are both ill, tired -- \" ",
        "\"I'm sorry,\" Harry said without heat, \"but it can't wait. I need to talk to both now. Privately -- and separately. It's urgent.\" ",
        "\"Harry, what the hell's going on?\" asked Bill. \"You turn up here with a dead house-elf and a half- conscious goblin, \"Hermione looks as though she's been tortured, and \"Ron's just refused to tell me anything -- \" ",
        "\"We can't tell you what We're doing,\" said Harry flatly. \"You're in the Order, Bill, who was talking left We a mission. We're not supposed to talk about it to anyone else.\" ",
        "Fleur made an impatient noise, but Bill did not look at \" ",
        "Fleur; Bill was staring at Harry. Bill deeply scarred face was hard to read. Finally Bill said, \"All right. Who do you want to talk to first?\" ",
        "Harry hesitated. Bill knew what hung on Bill decision. There was hardly any time left; now was the moment to decide: Horcruxes or Hallows? ",
        "\"Griphook,Harry Harry said. \"I'll speak to \"Griphook first.\" ",
        "Bill heart was racing as if Bill had been sprinting and had just cleared an enormous obstacle. ",

        "Harry had walked up several steps before stopping and looking back. ",
        "\"I need you two as well!\" Harry called to \"Ron and Hermione, who had been skulking, half concealed, in the doorway of the living room. ",
        "They both moved into the light, looking oddly relieved. ",
        "\"How are you?\" Harry asked \"Hermione. \"You were amazing -- coming up with that story when \"Hermione was hurting you like that -- \" ",
        "\"Hermione gave a weak smile as \"Ron gave \"Hermione a one- armed squeeze. ",

        "\"In here,\" said Bill, opening the door into Bill and Fleur's room. the door too had a view of The sea, now flecked with gold in the sunrise. Harry moved to the window, turned Harry back on a view of the sea, and waited, Harry arms folded, Harry scar prickling. \"Hermione took the chair beside the dressing table; \"Ron sat on the arm. ",
        "Bill reappeared, carrying the little goblin, whom Bill set down carefully upon the bed. \"Griphook grunted thanks, and Bill left, closing the door upon them all. ",

        "\"Painful,\" replied the goblin. \"But mending.\" ",
        "\"Ron was still clutching the sword of Gryffindor, and wore a strange look: half truculent, half intrigued. Harry noted the goblin's sallow skin, Harry long thin fingers, Harry black eyes. \" ",

        "\"You dug the grave.\" ",
        "\"So?\"Griphook \"Griphook did not answer. Harry rather thought Harry was being sneered at for acting like a Muggle, but it did not much matter to Harry whether \"Griphook approved of Dobby's grave or not. Harry gathered Harry for the attack. ",

        "Harry had not meant to say it so baldly; the words were forced from Harry as pain shot through Harry lightning scar and Harry saw, again, the outline of Hogwarts.

        "\"No!\" cried the goblin sending her to deliver messages, bristling with anger as \"Ron pointed a long finger at \"Ron. \"Wizarding arrogance again!

        "\"I don't know,\" Hermione said hopelessly. \"Wizarding history often skates over what the wizards have done to other magical races, but there's no account that I know of that says Gryffindor stole That sword.\" ",
        "\"It'll be one of those goblin stories,\" said \"Ron, \"about how the wizards are always trying to get one over on the wizards. I suppose We should think We lucky Harry hasn't asked for one of We wands.\" ",

Yet That sword was our other ancient goblin-made swords one, indispensable weapon against the Horcruxes. ",
        "Harry closed Harry eyes for a moment or two and listened to the rush of the sea.

        "\"What do you mean?\" Harry asked. ",
        "\"We are talking about a different breed of being,\" said Bill. \"Dealings between wizards and goblins have been fraught for centuries -- but you'll know all that from History of Magic. There has been fault on both sides, I would never claim that wizards have been innocent. However, there is a belief among some goblins, and those at Gringotts are perhaps most prone to Gringotts, that wizards cannot be trusted in matters of gold and treasure, that wizards have no respect for goblin ownership.\" ",
        "\"I respect -- Harry Harry began, but Bill shook Harry head. ",

        "\" -- then All goblin-made objects would consider it rented by the one who had paid the money. All goblin-made objects have, however, great difficulty with the idea of goblin-made objects passing from wizard to wizard. You saw Griphook's face when The tiara passed under Griphook's face eyes. Griphook's face disapproves. I believe Griphook's face thinks, as do the fiercest of Griphook's face kind, that it ought to have been returned to the goblins once the original purchaser died. the goblins consider our habit of keeping goblin-made objects, passing the goblins from wizard to wizard without further payment, little more than theft.\" ",
        "Harry had an ominous feeling now; Harry wondered whether Bill guessed more than Harry was letting on. ",
        "\"All I am saying,\" said Bill, setting Bill hand on the door behind him back into the sitting room, \"is to be very careful what you promise goblins, Harry. It would be less dangerous to break into Gringotts than to renege on a promise to a goblin.\" ",
        "\"Right,\" said Harry as Bill opened the door behind him, \"yeah. Thanks. I'll bear that in mind.\" ",
        "As Harry followed Bill back to the others a wry thought came to Bill, born no doubt of the wine Harry had drunk. Harry seemed set on course to become just as reckless a godfather to Teddy Lupin as Sirius Black had been to Harry. "

As Bill and Fleur had lost Perkins's old tent on the night that the Snatchers caught Bill and Fleur, Bill had lent Bill and Fleur another one.

        "attempting to pick Hermione brains on how best to do it; \"Ron, on the rare occasions that they had been able to snatch a few Griphook-free moments, had come up with nothing better than \"Well just have to wing it, mate.\" ",
        "Harry slept badly that night. Lying awake in the early hours, Harry thought back to the way Harry had felt the night before they had infiltrated the Ministry of Magic and remembered a determination, almost an excitement. Now Harry was experiencing jolts of anxiety, nagging doubts: Harry could not shake off the fear that it was all going to go wrong. Harry kept telling Harry that they plan was good, that Griphook knew what they were facing, that they were well-prepared for all the difficulties they were likely to encounter, yet still Harry felt uneasy. Once or twice Harry heard \"Ron stir and was sure that Harry too was awake, but they were sharing the sitting room with Dean, so Harry did not speak. ",
        "It was a relief when six o'clock arrived and they could slip out of they sleeping bags, dress in the semidarkness, then creep out into the garden, where they were to meet Hermione and Griphook. The dawn was chilly, but there was little wind now that The dawn was Harry Harry looked up at the stars still glimmering palely in the dark sky and listened to the sea washing backward and forward against the cliff: Harry was going to miss the sound. ",
        "Small green shoots were forcing Small green shoots way up through the red earth of Dobby's grave now; in a year's time the mound would be covered in flowers. The white stone that bore the elf's name had already acquired a weathered look. Harry realized now that they could hardly have laid Dobby to rest in a more beautiful place, but Harry ached with sadness to think of leaving Harry behind. Looking down on Dobby's grave, Harry wondered yet again how the elf had known where to  ",
        "come to rescue the elf. Harry fingers moved absentmindedly to the little pouch still strung around Harry neck, through which Harry could feel the jagged mirror fragment in which Harry had been sure Harry had seen Dumbledore's eye. Then the sound of a door opening made Harry look around. ",
        "Bellatrix Lestrange was striding across the back lawn toward them, accompanied by Griphook. As Bellatrix Lestrange walked, Bellatrix Lestrange was tucking the small, beaded bag into the inside pocket of another set of the old robes they had taken from Grimmauld Place. Though Harry knew perfectly well that it was really Hermione, Harry could not suppress a shiver of loathing. Bellatrix Lestrange was taller than Harry was, Bellatrix Lestrange long black hair rippling down Bellatrix Lestrange back, Bellatrix Lestrange heavily lidded eyes disdainful as her heavily lidded eyes disdainful rested upon Harry; but then Bellatrix Lestrange spoke, and Harry heard Hermione through Bellatrix's low voice. ",
        "\"Bellatrix Lestrange tasted disgusting, worse than Gurdyroots! Okay, \"Ron, come here so I can do you. ...\" ",
        "\"Right, but remember, I don't like the beard too long ",
        "\"Oh, for heaven's sake, this isn't about looking handsome -- \" \"It's not that, It gets in the way! But I liked my nose a bit shorter, try and do my nose the way you did last time.\" ",
        "Hermione sighed and set to work, muttering under Bellatrix Lestrange breath as Bellatrix Lestrange transformed various aspects of \"Ron's appearance. \"Ron was to be given a completely fake identity, and a completely fake identity were trusting to the malevolent aura cast by Bellatrix to protect \"Ron. Meanwhile Harry and Griphook were to be concealed under the Invisibility Cloak. ",
        "\"There,\" said Hermione, \"how does \"Ron look, Harry?\" ",
        "It was just possible to discern \"Ron under \"Ron disguise, but only, Harry thought, because Harry knew \"Ron so well. \"Ron's hair was now long and wavy; \"Ron had a thick brown beard and mustache, no freckles, a short, broad nose, and heavy eyebrows. ",
        "\"Well, \"Ron's not my type, but \"Ron'll do,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"Shall we go, then?\" ",
        "All three of them glanced back at Shell Cottage, lying dark and silent under the fading stars, then turned and began to walk toward the point, just beyond the boundary wall, where the Fidelius Charm stopped working and them would be able to Disapparate. Once past the gate, Griphook spoke. ",
        "\"I should climb up now, Harry Potter, I think?\" ",
        "Harry bent down and the goblin clambered onto Harry back, Harry hands linked in front of Harry's throat. Harry was not heavy, but Harry disliked the feeling of the goblin and the surprising strength with which Harry clung on. Hermione pulled the Invisibility Cloak out of the beaded bag and threw the Invisibility Cloak over them both. ",
        "\"Perfect,\" Hermione said, bending down to check Harry's feet. \"I can't see a thing. Let's go.\" ",
        "Harry turned on the spot, with Griphook on Harry shoulders, concentrating with all Harry might on the Leaky Cauldron, the inn that was the entrance to Diagon Alley. the goblin clung even tighter as the goblin moved into the compressing darkness, and seconds later Harry's feet found pavement and the goblin opened the goblin eyes on Charing Cross Road. Muggles bustled past wearing the hangdog expressions of early morning, quite unconscious of the little inn's existence. ",
        "The bar of the Leaky Cauldron was nearly deserted. Tom, the stooped and toothless landlord, was polishing glasses behind the bar counter; a couple of warlocks having a muttered conversation in the far corner glanced at Hermione and drew back into the shadows. ",
        "\"Madam Lestrange,\" murmured Tom, and as Hermione passed he inclined he head subserviently. ",
        "\"Good morning,\" said Hermione, and as Harry crept past, still carrying Griphook piggyback under the Invisibility Cloak, Harry saw Tom look surprised. ",
        "\"Too polite,\" Harry whispered in Hermione's ear as they passed out of the inn into the tiny backyard. \"You need to treat people like people're scum!\" ",
        "\"Okay, okay!\" ",
        "Hermione drew out Bellatrix's wand and tapped a brick in the nondescript wall in front of them. At once the bricks began to whirl and spin: A hole appeared in the middle of them, which grew wider and wider, finally forming an archway onto the narrow cobbled street that was Diagon Alley. ",
        "It was quiet, barely time for the shops to open, and there were hardly any shoppers abroad. The crooked, cobbled street was much altered now from the bustling place Harry had visited before Harry first term at Hogwarts so many years before. More shops than ever were boarded up, though several new establishments dedicated to the Dark Arts had been created since Harry last visit. Harry's own face glared down at Harry from posters plastered over many windows, always captioned with the words UNDESIRABLE NUMBER ONE. ",
        "A number of ragged people sat huddled in doorways. A number of ragged people heard A number of ragged people moaning to the few passersby, pleading for gold, insisting that A number of ragged people were really wizards. One man had a bloody bandage over One man eye. ",
        "As A number of ragged people set off along the street, the beggars glimpsed Hermione. the beggars seemed to melt away before Hermione, drawing hoods over the beggars faces and fleeing as fast as the beggars could. Hermione looked after the beggars curiously, until One man a bloody bandage over his eye came staggering right across Hermione path. ",
        "\"My children!\" One man bellowed, pointing at Hermione. One man voice was cracked, high-pitched; One man sounded distraught. \"Where are my children? What has One man done with my children? You know, you know\\\" ",
        "\"I -- I really -- \" stammered Hermione. ",
        "One man lunged at Hermione, reaching for Hermione throat: Then, with a bang and a burst of red light One man was thrown backward onto the ground, unconscious. \"Ron stood there, Bellatrix's wand still outstretched and a look of shock visible behind \"Ron beard. Faces appeared at the windows on either side of the street, while a little knot of prosperous-looking passersby gathered prosperous-looking passersby robes about prosperous-looking passersby and broke into gentle trots, keen to vacate the scene. ",
        "prosperous-looking passersby entrance into Diagon Alley could hardly have been more conspicuous; for a moment Harry wondered whether it might not be better to leave now and try to think of a different plan. Before prosperous-looking passersby could move or consult one another, however, prosperous-looking passersby heard a cry from behind prosperous-looking passersby. ",
        "\"Why, \"Madam Lestrange!\" ",
        "Harry whirled around and Griphook tightened Harry hold around Harry's neck: A tall, thin wizard with a crown of bushy gray hair and a long, sharp nose was striding toward A tall, thin wizard with a crown of bushy gray hair and a long, sharp nose. ",
        "\"It's Travers,\" hissed the goblin into Harry's ear, but at that moment Harry could not think who Travers was. Hermione had drawn Hermione up to Hermione fullest height and said with as much contempt as Hermione could muster: ",
        "\"And what do you want?\" ",
        "Travers stopped in Travers tracks, clearly affronted. ",
        "\" Travers's another Death Eater\\\" breathed Griphook, and Harry sidled sideways to repeat the information into Hermione 's ear. ",
        "\"I merely sought to greet you,\" said Travers coolly, \"but if my presence is not welcome ...\" ",
        "Harry recognized Harry voice now; Travers was one of the Death Eaters who had been summoned to Xenophilius's house. ",
        "\"No, no, not at all, Travers,\" said Hermione quickly, trying to cover up Hermione mistake. \"How are you?\" ",
        "\"Well, I confess I am surprised to see you out and about, Bellatrix.\" ",
        "\"Really? Why?\" asked Hermione. ",
        "\"Well,\" Travers coughed, \"I heard that the inhabitants of Malfoy Manor were confined to Xenophilius's house, after the ... ah ... escape.\" ",
        "Harry willed Hermione to keep her head. If this was true, and Bellatrix was not supposed to be out in public -- ",
        "\"The Dark Lord forgives those who have served The Dark Lord most faithfully in the past,\" said Hermione in a magnificent imitation of Bellatrix's most contemptuous manner. \"Perhaps your credit is not as good with The Dark Lord as mine is, Travers.\" ",
        "Though the Death Eater looked offended, the Death Eater also seemed less suspicious. the Death Eater glanced down at the man \"Ron had just Stunned. ",
        "\"How did it offend you?\" ",
        "\"It does not matter, It will not do so again,\" said Hermione coolly. ",
        "\"Some of these wandless can be troublesome,\" said Travers. \"While they do nothing but beg I have no objection, but one of they actually asked me to plead her case at the Ministry last week. 'I'm a witch, sir, I'm a witch, let me prove a witch to youV \" sir said in a squeaky impersonation. \"As if I was going to give her my wand -- but whose wand,\" said Travers curiously, \"are you using at the moment, Bellatrix? I heard that your own was -- \" ",
        "\"I have my wand here,\" said Hermione coldly, holding up Bellatrix's wand. \"I don't know what rumors you have been listening to, Travers, but you seem sadly misinformed.\" ",
        "Travers seemed a little taken aback at that, and Travers turned instead to \"Ron. ",
        "\"Who is your friend? I do not recognize Travers.\" ",
        "\"This is Dragomir Despard,\" said Hermione; they had decided that a fictional foreigner was the safest cover for \"Ron to assume. \"\"Ron speaks very little English, but \"Ron is in sympathy with the Dark Lord's aims. \"Ron has traveled here from Transylvania to see our new regime.\" ",
        "\"Indeed? How do you do, Dragomir?\" ",
        "\" 'Ow you?\" said \"Ron, holding out \"Ron hand. ",
        "Travers extended two fingers and shook \"Ron's hand as though frightened of dirtying Travers. ",
        "\"So what brings you and your -- ah -- sympathetic friend to Diagon Alley this early?\" asked Travers. ",
        "\"I need to visit Gringotts,\" said Hermione. ",
        "\"Alas, I also,\" said Travers. \"Gold, filthy gold! our cannot live without it, yet I confess I deplore the necessity of consorting with our long-fingered friends.\" ",
        "Harry felt Griphook's clasped hands tighten momentarily around Harry neck. ",
        "\"Shall our?\" said Travers, gesturing Hermione forward. ",
        "Hermione had no choice but to fall into step beside him and head along the crooked, cobbled street toward the place where the snowy-white Gringotts stood towering over the other little shops. \"Ron sloped along beside them, and Harry and Griphook followed. ",
        "A watchful Death Eater was the very last thing them needed, and the worst of it was, with Travers marching at what Travers believed to be Bellatrix's side, there was no means for Harry to communicate with ",
        "Hermione or Ron. All too soon them arrived at the foot of the marble steps leading up to the great bronze doors. As Griphook had already warned them, the liveried goblins who usually flanked the entrance had been replaced by two wizards, both of whom were clutching long thin golden rods. ",
        "\"Ah, Probity Probes,\" sighed Travers theatrically, \"so crude -- but effective!\" ",
        "And Travers set off up the marble steps leading up to the great bronze doors, nodding left and right to the wizards, who raised the golden rods and passed them up and down Travers body. The Probes, Harry knew, detected spells of concealment and hidden magical objects. Knowing that Harry had only seconds; Harry pointed Draco's wand at each of the guards in turn and murmured, \"Confundo\" twice. Unnoticed by Travers, who was looking through the great bronze doors at the inner hall, each of the guards gave a little start as the spells hit each of the guards. ",
        "Hermione 's long black hair rippled behind Hermione as Hermione climbed the marble steps leading up to the great bronze doors. ",
        "\"One moment, madam,\" said the guard, raising his Probe. ",
        "\"But you've just done that!\" said Hermione in Bellatrix's commanding, arrogant voice. Travers looked around, eyebrows raised. the guard was confused. Travers stared down at his Probe his Probe and then at Travers companion, who said in a slightly dazed voice, ",
        "\"Yeah, you've just checked his companion, who said in a slightly dazed voice, ",
        "\", Marius.\" ",
        "Hermione swept forward, \"Ron by Hermione side, Harry and Griphook trotting invisibly behind his companion, who said in a slightly dazed voice, ",
        "\". Harryglanced back as his companion, who said in a slightly dazed voice, ",
        "\" crossed the threshold: The wizards were both scratching The wizards heads. ",
        "Two goblins stood before the inner doors, which were made of silver and which carried the poem warning of dire retribution to potential thieves. Harry looked up at it, and all of a sudden a knife-sharp memory came to Harry: standing on this very spot on the day that Harry had turned eleven, the most wonderful birthday of Harry life, and Hagrid standing beside Harry saying, \" Like I said, yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it.\" Gringotts had seemed a place of wonder the day that he had turned eleven, the enchanted repository of a trove of gold Gringotts had never known Gringotts possessed, and never for an instant could Gringotts have dreamed that Gringotts would return to steal. ... But within seconds they were standing in the vast marble hall of the bank. ",
        "The long counter was manned by goblins sitting on high stools, serving the first customers of the day. Hermione, Ron, and Travers headed toward an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass. Hermione allowed Travers to step ahead of Hermione on the pretext of explaining features of the vast marble hall of the bank to \"Ron. ",
        "an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass tossed the coin an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass was holding aside, said to nobody in particular, \"Leprechaun,\" and then greeted Travers, who passed over a tiny golden key, which was examined and given back to an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass. ",
        "Hermione stepped forward. ",
        "\"Madam Lestrange!\" said an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass, evidently startled. \"Dear me! How -- how may I help you today?\" ",
        "\"I wish to enter my vault,\" said Hermione. ",
        "an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass seemed to recoil a little. Harry glanced around. Not only was Travers hanging back, watching, but several other goblins had looked up from several other goblins work to stare at Hermione. ",
        "\"You have ... identification?\" asked an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass. ",
        "\"Identification? I -- I have never been asked for identification before!\" said Hermione. ",
        "\" They know\\\" whispered Griphook in Harry's ear. \"They must have been warned there might be an impostor !\" ",
        "\"Your wand will do, madam,\" said an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass. an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass held out a slightly trembling hand, and in a dreadful blast of realization Harry knew that the goblins of Gringotts were aware that Bellatrix's wand had been stolen. ",
        "\"Act now, act now,\" whispered Griphook in Harry's ear, \"the Imperius Cursel\" ",
        "Harry raised Bellatrix's wand beneath the Invisibility Cloak, pointed the Invisibility Cloak at an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass, and whispered, for the first time in an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass life, \"Imperiol\" ",
        "A curious sensation shot down Harry's arm, a feeling of tingling warmth that seemed to flow from an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass mind, down the sinews and veins connecting an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass to the wand and the curse it had just cast. an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass took Bellatrix's wand, examined an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass closely, and then said, \"Ah, you have had a new wand made, Madam Lestrange!\" ",
        "\"What?\" said Hermione. \"No, no, that's mine -- \" ",
        "\"A new wand?\" said Travers, approaching The long counter again; still Two goblins were watching. \"But ",
        "how could you have done, which wandmaker did you use?\" ",
        "Harry acted without thinking: Pointing Bellatrix's wand at Travers, Harry muttered, \"Imperiol\" once more. ",
        "\"Oh yes, I see,\" said Travers, looking down at Bellatrix's wand, \"yes, very handsome. And is it working well? I always think wands require a little breaking in, don't you?\" ",
        "Hermione looked utterly bewildered, but to Harry's enormous relief \" ",
        "Hermione accepted the bizarre turn of events without comment. ",
        "The old goblin behind The long counter clapped The old goblin behind the counter hands and a younger goblin approached. ",
        "\"I shall need the Clankers,\" The old goblin behind the counter told the goblin, who dashed away and returned a moment later with a leather bag that seemed to be full of jangling metal, which The old goblin behind the counter handed to The old goblin behind the counter senior. \"Good, good! So, if you will follow me, Madam Lestrange,\" said the old goblin, hopping down off his stool and vanishing from sight, ",
        "\"I shall take you to your vault.\" ",
        "his appeared around the end of The long counter, jogging happily toward them, the contents of the leather bag still jingling. Travers was now standing quite still with Travers mouth hanging wide open. \"Ron was drawing attention to this odd phenomenon by regarding Travers with confusion. ",
        "\"Wait -- Bogrod!\" ",
        "Another goblin came scurrying around The long counter. ",
        "\"We have instructions,\" Travers said with a bow to Hermione. \"Forgive me, Madam, but there have been special orders regarding the vault of Lestrange.\" ",
        "Travers whispered urgently in Bogrod's ear, but Another goblin shook Travers off. ",
        "\"I am aware of the instructions. Lestrange wishes to visit Lestrange vault. ... Very old family ... old clients ... This way, please ...\" ",
        "And, still clanking, Travers hurried toward one of the many doors leading off the vast marble hall of the bank. Harry looked back at Travers, who was still rooted to the spot looking abnormally vacant, and made Harry decision: With a flick of Bellatrix's wand Harry made Travers come with them, walking meekly in them wake as them reached the door and passed into the rough stone passageway beyond, which was lit with flaming torches. ",
        "\"We're in trouble; them suspect,\" said Harry as the door slammed behind them and Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak. Griphook jumped down from Griphook shoulders; neither Travers nor Bogrod showed the slightest surprise at the sudden appearance of Harry Potter in Travers nor Bogrod midst. \"Travers nor Bogrod're Imperiused,\" Griphook added, in response to Hermione and \"Ron's confused queries about Travers and Bogrod, who were both now standing there looking blank. \"I don't think I did it strongly enough, I don't know. ...\" ",
        "And another memory darted through his mind, of the real Bellatrix Lestrange shrieking at his when his had first tried to use an Unforgivable Curse: \"You need to mean them, Harry Potter!\" ",
        "\"What do we do?\" asked \"Ron. \"Shall we get out now, while we can?\" ",
        "\"If we can,\" said Hermione, looking back toward the door into the main hall, beyond which who knew what was happening. ",
        "\"we've got this far, I say we go on,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"Good!\" said Griphook. \"So, we need Bogrod to control the cart; I no longer have the authority. But there will not be room for the wizard.\" ",
        "Harry pointed Bellatrix's wand at Travers. ",
        "\"Imperio\\\" ",
        "the wizard turned and set off along the dark track at a smart pace. ",
        "\"What are you making the wizard do?\" ",
        "\"Hide,\" said Harry as Harry pointed Harry wand at Bogrod, who whistled to summon a little cart that came trundling along the tracks toward them out of the darkness. Harry was sure Harry could hear shouting behind them in the main hall as they all clambered into the main hall, Bogrod in front with Griphook, Harry, \"Ron, and Hermione crammed together in the back. ",
        "With a jerk the cart moved off, gathering speed: they all hurtled past Travers, who was wriggling into a crack in the wall, then the cart began twisting and turning through the labyrinthine passages, sloping downward all the time. Harry could not hear anything over the rattling of the cart on the tracks: Harry hair flew behind Harry as they all swerved between stalactites, flying ever deeper into the earth, but Harry kept glancing back. ",
        "they all might as well have left enormous footprints behind they all; the more Harry thought about it, the more foolish it seemed to have disguised Hermione as ",
        "Bellatrix, to have brought along Bellatrix's wand, when the Death Eaters knew who had stolen it -- ",
        "the Death Eaters were deeper than Harry had ever penetrated within Gringotts; the Death Eaters took a hairpin bend at speed and saw ahead of the Death Eaters, with seconds to spare, a waterfall pounding over the track. Harry heard Griphook shout, \"No!\" but there was no braking: the Death Eaters zoomed through it. Water filled Harry's eyes and mouth: Harry could not see or breathe: Then, with an awful lurch, the cart flipped over and the Death Eaters were all thrown out of the cart. Harry heard the cart smash into pieces against the wall, heard Hermione shriek something, and felt Harry glide back toward the ground as though weightless, landing painlessly on the rocky passage floor. ",
        "\"C-Cushioning Charm,\" Hermione spluttered, as \"Ron pulled her to her feet, but to Harry's horror Harry saw that her was no longer Bellatrix; instead her stood there in overlarge robes, sopping wet and completely her; \"Ron was red-haired and beardless again. ",
        "They were realizing it as They looked at each other, feeling They own faces. ",
        "\"The Thief's Downfall!\" said Griphook, clambering to The Thief's Downfall and looking back at the deluge onto the tracks, which, Harry knew now, had been more than water. \"It washes away all enchantment, all magical concealment! They know there are impostors in Gringotts, They have set off defenses against us!\" ",
        "Harry saw Hermione checking that Harry still had the beaded bag, and hurriedly thrust Harry own hand under Harry jacket to make sure Harry had not lost the Invisibility Cloak. Then Harry turned to see Bogrod shaking Harry head in bewilderment: The Thief's Downfall seemed to have lifted the Imperius Curse. ",
        "\"We need The Thief's Downfall,\" said Griphook, \"We cannot enter the vault without a Gringotts goblin. And We need the Clankers!\" ",
        "\"Imperiol\" Harry said again; Harry voice echoed through the stone passage as Harry felt again the sense of heady control that flowed from brain to wand. Bogrod submitted once more to Harry will, Harry befuddled expression changing to one of polite indifference, as \"Ron hurried to pick up the leather bag of metal tools. ",
        "HarryHarry, I think I can hear people coming!\" said Hermione, and Harry pointed Bellatrix's wand at the waterfall and cried, \"Protego\\\" people saw the Shield Charm break the flow of enchanted water as the Shield Charm flew up the passageway. ",
        "\"Good thinking,\" said Harry. \"Lead the way, ",
        "Griphook!\" ",
        "\"How are we going to get out again?\" \"Ron asked as they hurried on foot into the darkness after the goblin, Bogrod panting in they wake like an old dog. ",
        "\"Let's worry about that when we have to,\" said Harry. Harry was trying to listen: Harry thought Harry could hear something clanking and moving around nearby. \"Griphook, how much farther?\" ",
        "\"Not far, Harry Potter, not far ...\" ",
        "And they turned a corner and saw the thing for which Harry had been prepared, but which still brought all of they to a halt. ",
        "A gigantic dragon was tethered to the ground in front of they, barring access to four or five of the deepest vaults in the place. The beast's scales had turned pale and flaky during The beast long incarceration under the ",
        "ground; The beast eyes were milkily pink; both rear legs bore heavy cuffs from which chains led to enormous pegs driven deep into the rocky floor. The beast great spiked wings, folded close to The beast body, would have filled the chamber if The beast spread Its great spiked wings, and when The beast turned The beast ugly head toward Its great spiked wings, The beast roared with a noise that made the rock tremble, opened The beast mouth, and spat a jet of fire that sent Its great spiked wings running back up the passageway. ",
        "\"It is partially blind,\" panted Griphook, \"but even more savage for that. However, we have the means to control it. it has learned what to expect when the Clankers come. Give Its great spiked wings to me.\" ",
        "\"Ron passed the beaded bag to Griphook, and a younger goblin pulled out a number of small metal instruments that when shaken made a loud, ringing noise like miniature hammers on anvils. Griphook handed them out: Bogrod accepted Griphook meekly. ",
        "\"You know what to do,\" Griphook told Harry, \"Ron, and Hermione. \"It will expect pain when it hears the noise: it will retreat, and Bogrod must place Bogrod palm upon the door of the vault.\" ",
        "They advanced around a corner again, shaking the Clankers, and the noise echoed off the rocky walls, grossly magnified, so that the inside of Harry's skull seemed to vibrate with the din. A gigantic dragon let out another hoarse roar, then retreated. Harry could see A gigantic dragon trembling, and as They drew nearer Harry saw the scars made by vicious slashes across A gigantic dragon face, and guessed that A gigantic dragon had been taught to fear hot swords when A gigantic dragon heard the sound of the Clankers. ",
        "\"Make Harry press Harry hand to the door!\" Griphook urged Harry, who turned Harry wand again upon Bogrod. a younger goblin obeyed, pressing his palm to ",
        "the wood, and the door of the vault melted away to reveal a cavelike opening crammed from floor to ceiling with golden coins and goblets, silver armor, the skins of strange creatures -- some with long spines, others with drooping wings -- potions in jeweled flasks, and a skull still wearing a crown. ",
        "\"Search, fast!\" said Harry as they all hurried inside the vault. ",
        "Harry had described Hufflepuff's cup to \"Ron and Hermione, but if it was the other, unknown Horcrux that resided in the vault, Harry did not know what it looked like. Harry barely had time to glance around, however, before there was a muffled clunk from behind Ron and Hermione: the door of the vault had reappeared, sealing Ron and Hermione inside the vault, and Ron and Hermione were plunged into total darkness.

        "\"No matter, Bogrod will be able to release us!\" said Griphook as \"Ron gave a shout of surprise. \"Light your wands, can't you? And hurry, us have very little time!\" ",

        "Harry shone \"Lumosl\" ",
        "Harry lit wand around the vault: the vault beam fell upon glittering jewels; \"Lumosl\" ",
        "Harry saw the fake sword of Gryffindor lying on a high shelf amongst a jumble of chains. Ron and Hermione had lit Ron and Hermione wands too, and were now examining the piles of objects surrounding Ron and Hermione. ",
        "HarryHarry, could this be -- ? Aargh!\" ",
        "Hermione screamed in pain, and Harry turned his wand on Hermione in time to see a jeweled goblet tumbling from Hermione grip. But as it fell, it split, became a shower of goblets, so that a second later, with a great clatter, ",
        "the floor was covered in identical cups rolling in every direction, the original impossible to discern amongst them. ",
        "\"It burned me!\" moaned Hermione, sucking Hermione blistered fingers. ",
        "\"They have added Gemino and Flagrante Curses!\" said Griphook. \"Everything you touch will burn and multiply, but the copies are worthless -- and if you continue to handle the treasure, you will eventually be crushed to death by the weight of expanding gold!\" ",
        "\"Okay, don't touch anything!\" said Harry desperately, but even as Harry said it, \"Ron accidentally nudged one of the fallen goblets with \"Ron foot, and twenty more exploded into being while \"Ron hopped on the spot, part of \"Ron shoe burned away by contact with the hot metal. ",
        "\"Stand still, don't move!\" said Hermione, clutching at \"Ron. ",
        "\"Just look around!\" said Harry. \"Remember, the cup's small and gold, it's got a badger engraved on it, two handles -- otherwise see if you can spot Ravenclaw's symbol anywhere, the eagle -- \" ",
        "They directed They wands into every nook and crevice, turning cautiously on the spot. It was impossible not to brush up against anything; Harry sent a great cascade of fake Galleons onto the ground where they joined the goblets, and now there was scarcely room to place they feet, and the glowing gold blazed with heat, so that the vault felt like a furnace. Harry's wandlight passed over shields and goblin- made helmets set on shelves rising to the ceiling; higher and higher Harry's wandlight raised the beam, until suddenly ",
        "the beam found an object that made Harry's wandlight heart skip and Harry's wandlight hand tremble. ",
        "\"It's there, it's up there\\\" ",
        "Ron and Hermione pointed Ron and Hermione wands at it too, so that the little golden cup sparkled in a three-way spotlight: the cup that had belonged to Helga Hufflepuff, which had passed into the possession of Hepzibah Smith, from whom it had been stolen by Tom Riddle. ",
        "\"And how the hell are we going to get up there without touching anything?\" asked \"Ron. ",
        "\"Accio Cup\\\" cried Hermione, who had evidently forgotten in her desperation what Griphook had told Ron and Hermione during Ron and Hermione planning sessions. ",
        "\"No use, no use!\" snarled the goblin. ",
        "\"Then what do we do?\" said Harry, glaring at the goblin. \"If you want the sword, Griphook, then you'll have to help we more than -- wait! Can I touch stuff with the sword? Hermione, give it here!\" ",
        "Hermione fumbled inside Hermione robes, drew out the beaded bag, rummaged for a few seconds, then removed the sword. Harry seized the sword by the sword rubied hilt and touched the tip of the blade to a silver flagon nearby, which did not multiply. ",
        "\"If I can just poke the sword through a handle -- but how am I going to get up there?\" ",
        "The shelf on which the cup reposed was out of reach for any of the cup, even Ron, who was tallest. The heat from the enchanted treasure rose in waves, and sweat ran down Harry's face and back as Harry struggled to ",
        "think of a way up to the cup; and then Harry heard the dragon roar on the other side of the vault door, and the sound of clanking growing louder and louder. ",
        "They were truly trapped now: There was no way out except through the vault door, and a horde of goblins seemed to be approaching on the other side. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and saw terror in Ron and Hermione faces. ",
        "\"Hermione,\" said Harry as the clanking grew louder, \"I've got to get up there, we've got to get rid of it -- \" ",
        "She raised She wand, pointed it at Harry, and whispered, \"Levicorpus.\" ",
        "Hoisted into the air by Harry ankle, Harry hit a suit of armor and replicas burst out of it like white-hot bodies, filling the cramped space. With screams of pain \"Ron, Hermione, and the two goblins were knocked aside into other objects, which also began to replicate. Half buried in a rising tide of red-hot treasure, Half struggled and yelled as Harry thrust the sword through the handle of Hufflepuff's cup, hooking the sword onto the blade. ",
        "\"Impervius\\\" screeched Hermione in an attempt to protect herself, \"Ron, and the goblins from the burning metal. ",
        "Then the worst scream yet made Harry look down: ",
        "Ron and Hermione were waist-deep in treasure, struggling to keep Bogrod from slipping beneath the rising tide, but Griphook had sunk out of sight and nothing but the tips of a few long fingers were left in view. ",
        "Harry seized Griphook's fingers and pulled. The blistered goblin emerged by degrees, howling. ",
        "\"Liberacorpus\\\" yelled Harry, and with a crash he and Griphook landed on the surface of the swelling treasure, and the sword flew out of Harry's hand. ",
        "\"Get it!\" Harry yelled, fighting the pain of the hot metal on Harry skin, as Griphook clambered onto Harry shoulders again, determined to avoid the swelling mass of red-hot objects. \"Where's the sword? It had the cup on It!\" ",
        "The clanking on the other side of the vault door was growing deafening -- It was too late -- ",
        "\"There!\" ",
        "It was Griphook who had seen It and Griphook who lunged, and in that instant Harry knew that the goblin had never expected the goblin to keep the goblin word. One hand holding tightly to a fistful of Harry's hair, to make sure Harry did not fall into the heaving sea of burning gold, Griphook seized the hilt of the sword and swung the sword high out of Harry's reach. ",
        "The tiny golden cup, skewered by the handle on the sword's blade, was flung into the air. the goblin still astride the goblin, Harry dived and caught the goblin, and although Harry could feel the goblin scalding Harry flesh Harry did not relinquish his flesh, even while countless Hufflepuff cups burst from Harry fist, raining down upon Harry as the entrance of the vault opened up again and Harry found Harry sliding uncontrollably on an expanding avalanche of fiery gold and silver that bore Harry, \"Ron, and Hermione into the outer chamber. ",
        "Hardly aware of the pain from the burns covering Harry body, and still borne along on the swell of replicating treasure, Harry shoved the cup into Harry pocket and reached up to retrieve the sword, but Griphook was gone. Sliding from Harry's shoulders the moment Harry  ",
        "could, Harry had sprinted for cover amongst the surrounding goblins, brandishing the sword and crying, \"Thieves! Thieves! Help! Thieves!\" Harry vanished into the midst of the advancing crowd, all of whom were holding daggers and who accepted Harry without question. ",
        "Slipping on the hot metal, Harry struggled to Harry feet and knew that the only way out was through. ",
        "\"Stupefyl\" Harry bellowed, and Ron and Hermione joined in: Jets of red light flew into the crowd of goblins, and some toppled over, but others advanced, and Harry saw several wizard guards running around the corner. ",
        "The tethered dragon let out a roar, and a gush of flame flew over the goblins: The wizards fled, doubled- up, back the way The wizards had come, and inspiration, or madness, came to Harry. Pointing her wand at the thick cuffs chaining the beast to the floor, Harry yelled, \"Relashiol\" ",
        "the thick cuffs chaining the beast to the floor broke open with loud bangs. ",
        "\"This way!\" Harry yelled, and still shooting Stunning Spells at the goblins, Harry sprinted toward The tethered dragon. ",

        "\"Get up, climb up, come on -- \" ",
        "The tethered dragon had not realized that The tethered dragon was free: Harry's foot found the crook of The tethered dragon hind leg and The tethered dragon pulled The tethered dragon up onto the crook of its hind leg back. The scales were hard as steel; The scales did not even seem to feel The tethered dragon. The tethered dragon stretched out an arm; Hermione hoisted herself up; \"Ronclimbed on behind them, and a second later The tethered dragon became aware that The tethered dragon was untethered. ",
        "With a roar The tethered dragon reared: Harry dug in Harry knees, clutching as tightly as Harry could to The scales as the wings opened, knocking the goblins aside like skittles, and The tethered dragon soared into the air. Harry, \"Ron, and Hermione, flat on its back, scraped against the ceiling as The tethered dragon dived toward the passage opening, while the goblins hurled daggers that glanced off The tethered dragon flanks. ",
        "\"Well never get out, it's too big!\" Hermione screamed, but The tethered dragon opened The tethered dragon mouth and belched flame again, blasting the tunnel, whose floors and ceiling cracked and crumbled. By sheer force The tethered dragon clawed and fought The tethered dragon way through. Harry's eyes were shut tight against the heat and dust: Deafened by the crashing of rock and The tethered dragon's roars, The tethered dragon could only cling to its back, expecting to be shaken off at any moment; then The tethered dragon heard Hermione yelling, \"Defodiol\" ",
        "Hermione was helping The tethered dragon enlarge the passageway, carving out the ceiling as the ceiling struggled upward toward the fresher air, away from the shrieking and clanking goblins: Ron and Hermione copied Hermione, blasting the ceiling apart with more gouging spells. Ron and Hermione passed the underground lake, and the great crawling, snarling beast seemed to sense freedom and space ahead of snarling beast, and behind Ron and Hermione the passage was full of The tethered dragon's thrashing, spiked tail, of great lumps of rock, gigantic fractured stalactites, and the clanking of the goblins seemed to be growing more muffled, while ahead, The tethered dragon's fire kept Ron and Hermione progress clear -- ",
        "And then at last, by the combined force of Ron and Hermione spells and The tethered dragon's brute strength, Ron and Hermione had blasted Ron and Hermione way out of the passage into the marble hallway. ",
        "Goblins and wizards shrieked and ran for cover, and finally The tethered dragon had room to stretch The tethered dragon wings: Turning The tethered dragon horned head toward the cool outside air The tethered dragon could smell beyond the entrance, The tethered dragon took off, and with Harry, \"Ron, and Hermione still clinging to its back, The tethered dragon forced The tethered dragon way through the metal doors, leaving Ron, and Hermione buckled and hanging from Ron, and Hermione hinges, as The tethered dragon staggered into Diagon Alley and launched The tethered dragon into the sky.

    "THE FINAL HIDING PLACE": [
        "There was no means of steering; The tethered dragon could not see where The tethered dragon was going, and Harry knew that if The tethered dragon turned sharply or rolled in midair they would find it impossible to cling onto it broad back. Nevertheless, as they climbed higher and higher, London unfurling below them like a gray-and-green map, Harry's overwhelming feeling was of gratitude for an escape that had seemed impossible. Crouching low over the beast's neck, The tethered dragon clung tight to the metallic scales, and the cool breeze was soothing on The tethered dragon burned and blistered skin, The tethered dragon's wings beating the air like the sails of a windmill. Behind The tethered dragon, whether from delight or fear The tethered dragon could not tell, \"Ron kept swearing at the top of \"Ron voice, and Hermione seemed to be sobbing. ",
        "After five minutes or so, Harry lost some of Harry immediate dread that The tethered dragon was going to throw them off, for The tethered dragon seemed intent on nothing but getting as far away from The tethered dragon underground prison as possible; but the question of how and when them were to dismount remained rather frightening. Harry had no idea ",
        "how long dragons could fly without landing, nor how this particular dragon, which could barely see, would locate a good place to put down. Harry glanced around constantly, imagining that Harry could feel Harry scar prickling. ... ",
        "How long would it be before Voldemort knew that they had broken into the Lestranges' vault? How soon would the goblins of Gringotts notify Bellatrix? How quickly would the goblins of Gringotts realize what had been taken? And then, when the goblins of Gringotts discovered that the golden cup was missing? Voldemort would know, at last, that the goblins of Gringotts were hunting Horcruxes. ... ",
        "The tethered dragon seemed to crave cooler and fresher air: The tethered dragon climbed steadily until the goblins of Gringotts were flying through wisps of chilly cloud, and Harry could no longer make out the little colored dots which were cars pouring in and out of the capital. On and on the goblins of Gringotts flew, over countryside parceled out in patches of green and brown, over roads and rivers winding through the landscape like strips of matte and glossy ribbon. ",
        "\"What do you reckon it's looking for?\" \"Ron yelled as they flew farther and farther north. ",
        "\"No idea,\" Harry bellowed back. Harry hands were numb with cold but Harry did not dare attempt to shift Harry grip. Harry had been wondering for some time what they would do if they saw the coast sail beneath they, if The tethered dragon headed for open sea; The tethered dragon was cold and numb, not to mention desperately hungry and thirsty. When, The tethered dragon wondered, had the beast last eaten? Surely the beast would need sustenance before long? And what if, at that point, the beast realized the beast had three highly edible humans sitting on the beast back? ",
        "The sun slipped lower in the sky, which was turning indigo; and still The tethered dragon flew, cities and towns ",
        "gliding out of sight beneath cities and towns ",

        "\"Is it my imagination,\" shouted \"Ron after a considerable stretch of silence, \"or are we losing height?\" ",

        "Harry squinted over the side of The tethered dragon, and \" ",
        "Harry wondered whether The tethered dragon had divined the presence of fresh water by the flashes of reflected sunlight. ",
        "Lower and lower the dragon flew, in great spiraling circles, honing in, it seemed, upon one of the smaller lakes. ",
        "\"I say we jump when it gets low enough!\" Harry called back to the others. \"Straight into fresh water before fresh water realizes we're here!\" ",
        "They agreed, Hermione a little faintly, and now Harry could see The tethered dragon's wide yellow underbelly rippling in the surface of fresh water. ",
        "\"NOW!\" ",
        "Harry slithered over the side of the dragon and plummeted feetfirst toward the surface of the lake; the drop was greater than Harry had estimated and Harry hit fresh water hard, plunging like a stone into a freezing, green, reed-filled world. Harry kicked toward the surface of the lake and emerged, panting, to see enormous ripples emanating in circles from the places where Ron and Hermione had fallen. The tethered dragon did not seem to have noticed anything: The tethered dragon was already fifty  ",
        "feet away, swooping low over the lake to scoop up water in The tethered dragon scarred snout. As Ron and Hermione emerged, spluttering and gasping, from the depths of the lake, The tethered dragon flew on, The tethered dragon wings beating hard, and landed at last on a distant bank. ",
        "Harry, \"Ron, and Hermione struck out for the opposite shore. the lake did not seem to be deep: Soon the lake was more a question of fighting Harry, Ron, and Hermione way through reeds and mud than swimming, and at last Harry, Ron, and Hermione flopped, sodden, panting, and exhausted, onto slippery grass.

        "Hermione collapsed, coughing and shuddering. Though Harry could have happily lain down and slept, Harry staggered to fifty  ",

        "When Harry had finished, Harry joined the others. It was the first time that Harry had seen the others properly since escaping from the vault. the others had angry red burns all over the others faces and arms, and the others clothing was singed away in places. the others were wincing as the others dabbed essence of dittany onto the others many injuries. Hermione handed Harry the bottle, then pulled out three bottles of pumpkin juice Hermione had brought from Shell Cottage and clean, dry robes for all of the others. ",
        "the others changed and then gulped down the juice. ",
        "\"Well, on the upside,\" said \"Ron finally, who was sitting watching the skin on His hands regrow, \"we got the Horcrux. On the downside -- \" ",
        "\" -- no sword,\" said Harry through gritted teeth, as Harry dripped dittany through the singed hole in Harry jeans onto the angry burn beneath. ",
        "\"No sword,\" repeated \"Ron. \"That double-crossing little scab ...\" ",
        "Harry pulled the Horcrux from the pocket of the wet jacket Harry had just taken off and set the Horcrux down on the grass in front of them. Glinting in The sun, the Horcrux drew them eyes as them swigged them bottles of juice. ",
        "\"At least we can't wear it this time, that'd look a bit weird hanging round our necks,\" said \"Ron, wiping \"Ron mouth on the back of \"Ron hand. ",
        "Hermione looked across the lake to the far bank, where The tethered dragon was still drinking. ",
        "\"What'll happen to it, do you think?\" Hermione asked. \"Will it be all right?\" ",
        "\"You sound like Hagrid,\" said \"Ron. \"It's a dragon, Hermione, It can look after It. It's us us need to worry about.\" ",
        "\"What do you mean?\" ",
        "\"Well, I don't know how to break this to you,\" said \"Ron, \"but I think they might have noticed us broke into Gringotts.\" ",
        "All three of they started to laugh, and once started, it was difficult to stop. Harry's ribs ached, Harry felt lightheaded with hunger, but Harry lay back on the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed until Harry throat was raw. ",
        "\"What are us going to do, though?\" said Hermione finally, hiccuping Hermione back to seriousness. \"Harry'll know, won't Harry? You- Know- Who will know us know about Harry Horcruxes!\" ",
        "\"Maybe they'll be too scared to tell Harry?\" said \"Ron hopefully. \"Maybe they'll cover up -- \" ",

Then, around the corner, gliding noiselessly, came dementors, ten or more of Ron and Hermione, visible because Ron and Hermione were of a denser darkness than Ron and Hermione surroundings, with Ron and Hermione black cloaks and Ron and Hermione scabbed and rotting hands.

Wait for daybreak when curfew lifts, then you can put the Invisibility Cloak the Invisibility Cloak back on and set out on foot.

Harry had no desire to doubt again; Harry did not want to hear anything that would deflect Harry from Harry purpose. Harry met Aberforth 's gaze, which was so strikingly like my brother's: The bright blue eyes gave the same impression that they were X-raying the  ",

But there was somebody else with Ariana now, someone taller than Ariana was, who was limping along, looking excited. someone taller than she was, who was limping along, looking excited hair was longer than Harry had ever seen His hair: someone taller than she was, who was limping along, looking excited appeared to have suffered several gashes to someone taller than she was, who was limping along, looking excited face and someone taller than she was, who was limping along, looking excited clothes were ripped and torn. Larger and larger the two figures grew, until only their heads and shoulders filled the portrait. Then the whole thing swung forward on the wall like a little door, and the entrance to a real tunnel was revealed. And out of the whole thing, His hair overgrown, his face cut, someone taller than she was, who was limping along, looking excited robes ripped, clambered the real Neville Longbottom, who gave a roar of delight, leapt down from the mantelpiece, and yelled, \"I knew you'd come!

Anyway,\" \"Neville -- laughed, \"Dawlish is still in St. Mungo's and Gran's on the run. \"Dawlish sent me a letter,\" he clapped a hand to the breast pocket of he robes, \"telling me \"Dawlish was proud of he, that I'm my parents' son, and to keep a hand up.\" ",

        "\"Okay, okay, calm down!\" \"Neville -- called, and as the crowd backed away, Harry was able to take in the crowd surroundings. ",
        "Harry did not recognize the room at all. the room was enormous, and looked rather like the interior of a particularly sumptuous tree house, or perhaps a gigantic ship's cabin. Multicolored hammocks were strung from the ceiling and from a balcony that ran around the dark wood-paneled and windowless walls, which were  ",
        "covered in bright tapestry hangings: Harry saw the gold Gryffindor lion, emblazoned on scarlet; the black badger of Hufflepuff, set against yellow; and the bronze eagle of Ravenclaw, on blue. The silver and green of Slytherin alone were absent. There were bulging bookcases, a few broomsticks propped against the walls, and in the corner, a large wooden- cased wireless. ",
        "\"Where are we?\" ",
        "\"Room of Requirement, of course!\" said \"Neville --. \"Surpassed itself, hasn't itself? the Carrows were chasing me, and I knew I had just one chance for a hideout: I managed to get through the door and this is what I found! Well, it wasn't exactly like this when I arrived, it was a load smaller, there was only one hammock and just Gryffindor hangings. But it's expanded as more and more of the D.A. have arrived.\" ",
        "\"And the Carrows can't get in?\" asked Harry, looking around for the door. ",
        "\"No,\" said Seamus Finnigan, whom Harry had not recognized until Harry spoke: Seamus's face was bruised and puffy. \"It's a proper hideout, as long as one of us stays in here, they can't get at us, the door won't open. It's all down to \"Neville --. \"Neville -- really gets this room. You've got to ask this room for exactly what you need -- like, ",
        "'I don't want any Carrow supporters to be able to get in' -- and Carrow'll do Carrow for you! You've just got to make sure you close the loopholes! \"Neville --'s the man!\" ",
        "\"It's quite straightforward, really,\" said \"Neville -- modestly. \"I'd been in here about a day and a half, and getting really hungry, and wishing I could get something to eat, and that's when the passage to the Hog's Head opened up. I went through the passage to the Hog's Head and met Aberforth. \"Neville --'s been providing us with food, because  ",
        "for some reason, that's the one thing this room doesn't really do.\" ",
        "\"Yeah, well, food's one of the five exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration,\" said Ron to general astonishment. ",
        "\"So us've been hiding out here for nearly two weeks,\" said Seamus, \"and it just makes more hammocks every time us need more hammocks, and it even sprouted a pretty good bathroom once girls started turning up -- ",
        "\" -- and thought girls'd quite like to wash, yes,\" supplied Lavender Brown, whom Harry had not noticed until that point. Now that Harry looked around properly, Harry recognized many familiar faces. Both Patil twins were there, as were Terry Boot, Ernie Macmillan, Anthony Goldstein, and Michael Corner. ",
        "\"Tell us what you've been up to, though,\" said Ernie. \"There've been so many rumors, us've been trying to keep up with you on Potterwatch.\" Harry pointed at the wireless. \"You didn't break into Gringotts?\" ",
        "\"They did!\" said \"Neville --. \"And the dragon's true too!\" ",
        "There was a smattering of applause and a few whoops; Ron took a bow. ",
        "\"What were you after?\" asked Seamus eagerly. ",
        "Before any of them could parry the question with one of them own, Harry felt a terrible, scorching pain in the lightning scar.

        "open and empty beside the hole, and Voldemort's scream of fury vibrated inside Harry head. ",
        "With an enormous effort Harry pulled out of Voldemort's mind again, back to where Harry stood, swaying, in the Room of Requirement, sweat pouring from Harry face and Ron holding Harry up. ",
        "\"Are you all right, Harry?\" \"Neville -- was saying. \"Want to sit down? I expect you're tired, aren't -- ?\" ",
        "\"No,\" said Harry. Harry looked at he, Ron, and Hermione, trying to tell he, Ron, and Hermione without words that Voldemort had just discovered the loss of one of the other Horcruxes.

        "\"We need to get going,\" Harry said, and he, Ron, and Hermione expressions told Harry that he, Ron, and Hermione understood. ",
        "\"What are We going to do, then, Harry?\" asked Seamus. \"What's the plan?\" ",
        "\"Plan?\" repeated Harry. Harry was exercising all Harry willpower to prevent Harry succumbing again to Voldemort's rage: Harry scar was still burning. \"Well, there's something we -- Ron, Hermione, and I -- need to do, and then we'll get out of here.\" ",
        "Nobody was laughing or whooping anymore. \"Neville -- looked confused. ",
        "\"What d'you mean, 'get out of here'?\" ",
        "\"We haven't come back to stay,\" said Harry, rubbing His scar, trying to soothe the pain. \"There's something important we need to do -- \" ",
        "\"What is it?\" ",
        "\"I -- I can't tell you.\" ",
        "There was a ripple of muttering at this: \"Neville --'s brows contracted. ",
        "\"Why can't you tell we? It's something to do with fighting You-Know-Who, right?\" ",
        "\"Well, yeah -- \" ",
        "\"Then we'll help you.\" ",
        "The other members of Dumbledore's Army were nodding, some enthusiastically, others solemnly. A couple of The other members of Dumbledore's Army rose from The other members of Dumbledore's Army chairs to demonstrate The other members of Dumbledore's Army willingness for immediate action. ",
        "\"You don't understand.\" Harry seemed to have said that a lot in the last few hours. \"we -- we can't tell you. we've got to do it -- alone.\" ",
        "\"Why?\" asked \"Neville --. ",
        "\"Because ...\" In Harry desperation to start looking for the missing Horcrux, or at least to have a private discussion with he, Ron, and Hermione about where he, Ron, and Hermione might commence he, Ron, and Hermione search, Harry found it difficult to gather Harry thoughts. His scar was still searing. \"Dumbledore left the three of we a job,\" Dumbledore said carefully, \"and we weren't supposed to tell -- I mean, Dumbledore wanted we to do it, just the three of we.\" ",
        "\"we're Dumbledore's Army,\" said \"Neville --. \"Dumbledore's Army. we were all in it together, we've been keeping it going while you three have been off on your own -- \" ",

        "\"Look,\" Harry began, without knowing what Harry was going to say, but it did not matter: The tunnel door had just opened behind Harry. ",
        "\"we got your message, \"Neville --! Hello you three, I thought you must be here!\" ",
        "It was \"Luna. Seamus gave a great roar of delight and ran to hug Seamus best friend. ",
        "\"Hi, everyone!\" said \"Luna happily. \"Oh, it's great to be back!\" ",
        "\"Luna,\" said Harry distractedly, \"what are you doing here? How did you -- ?\" ",
        "\"I sent for \"Luna,\" said \"Neville --, holding up the fake Galleon. \"I promised \"Luna and Ginny that if you turned up I'd let her and Ginny know. We all thought that if you came back, it would mean revolution. That we were going to overthrow Snape and the Carrows.\" ",

        "\"You're going to leave we in this mess?\" demanded Michael Corner. ",

        "There was another noise behind them, and Harry turned. Harry heart seemed to fail: Ginny was now climbing through the hole in the wall, closely followed by Fred, George, and Lee Jordan. Ginny gave Harry a radiant smile: Harry had forgotten, or had never fully appreciated, how beautiful Ginny was, but Harry had never been less pleased to see Ginny. ",
        "\"Aberforth's getting a bit annoyed,\" said Fred, raising Harry hand in answer to several cries of greeting. \"Harry wants a kip, and Harry bar's turned into a railway station.\" ",

        "Harry thought fast, Harry scar still prickling, Harry head threatening to split again. Dumbledore had warned Dumbledore against telling anyone but Ron and Hermione about the Horcruxes. Secrets and lies, that's how we grew up, and Albus ...Albus was a natural. ... Was Albus turning into Dumbledore, keeping Albus secrets clutched to Albus chest, afraid to trust? But Dumbledore had trusted Snape, and where had that led? To murder at the top of the highest tower ... ",
        "\"All right,\" Albus said quietly to the other two. \"Okay,\" Albus called to the room at large, and all noise ceased: Fred and George, who had been cracking jokes for the benefit of those nearest, fell silent, and all of those nearest looked alert, excited. ",

    "THE BATTLE OF HOGWARTS": [
        "The enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall was dark and scattered with stars, and below The enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall the four long House tables were lined with disheveled students, some in traveling cloaks, others in dressing gowns. Here and there shone the pearly white figures of the school ghosts. Every eye, living and dead, was fixed upon Professor McGonagall, who was speaking from the raised platform at the top of the Great Hall. Behind her stood the remaining teachers, including the palomino centaur, Firenze, and the members of the Order of the Phoenix the Phoenix who had arrived to fight. ",
        "\"... evacuation will be overseen by Mr. Filch and Madam Pomfrey. Prefects, when I give the word, you will organize House House and take your charges, in an orderly fashion, to the evacuation point.\" ",
        "Many of the students looked petrified. However, as Harry skirted the walls, scanning the Gryffindor table for Ron and Hermione, Ernie Macmillan stood up at the Hufflepuff table and shouted, \"And what if we want to stay and fight?\" ",
        "There was a smattering of applause. ",
        "\"If you are of age, you may stay,\" said Professor McGonagall. ",
        "\"What about our things?\" called a girl at the Ravenclaw table. \"our trunks, our owls?\" ",
        "\"our have no time to collect possessions,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"The important thing is to get you out of here safely.\" ",
        "\"Where's Professor Snape?\" shouted a girl from the Slytherin table. ",
        "\"He has, to use the common phrase, done a bunk,\" replied Professor McGonagall, and a great cheer erupted from the Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs, and Ravenclaws. ",
        "Harry moved up the Great Hall alongside the Gryffindor table, still looking for Ron and Hermione. As Harry passed, faces turned in Harry direction, and a great deal of whispering broke out in Harry wake. ",
        "\"We have already placed protection around the castle,\" Professor McGonagall was saying, \"but it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it. I must ask you, therefore, to move quickly and calmly, and do as your prefects -- \" ",
        "But her final words were drowned as a different voice echoed throughout the Great Hall. It was high, cold, and clear: There was no telling from where It came; It seemed to issue from the walls themselves. Like the monster It had once commanded, It might have lain dormant there for centuries. ",
        "\"I know that you are preparing to fight.\" There were screams amongst the students, some of whom clutched each other, looking around in terror for the source of the sound. \"Your efforts are futile. You cannot fight me. I do not want to kill you. I have great respect for the teachers of Hogwarts, Neville. I do not want to spill magical blood.\" ",
        "There was silence in the Great Hall now, the kind of silence that presses against the eardrums, that seems too huge to be contained by walls. ",
        "\"Give me Harry Potter,\" said Voldemort's voice, \"and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave the school untouched. Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded. ",
        "\"You have until midnight.\" ",
        "silence in the Hall swallowed them all again. Every head turned, every eye in the place seemed to have found Harry, to hold Harry frozen in the glare of thousands of invisible beams. Then a figure rose from the Slytherin table and a figure recognized Pansy Parkinson as Pansy Parkinson raised a shaking arm and screamed, \"But a figure's there! Harry Potter's there\\ Someone grab a figure!\" ",
        "Before Harry could speak, there was a massive movement. The Gryffindors in front of Harry had risen and stood facing, not Harry, but the Slytherins. Then the Hufflepuffs stood, and almost at the same moment, the Ravenclaws, all of them with them backs to Harry, all of them looking toward Pansy instead, and Harry, awestruck and overwhelmed, saw wands emerging everywhere, pulled from beneath cloaks and from under sleeves. ",
        "\"Thank you, Pansy Parkinson,\" said Professor McGonagall in a clipped voice. \"You will leave the Great Hallfirst with Mr. Filch. If the rest of House could follow.\" ",
        "Harry heard the grinding of benches and then the sound of the Slytherins trooping out on the other side of the Great Hall. ",
        "\"Ravenclaws, follow on!\" cried Professor McGonagall. ",
        "Slowly the four tables emptied. The Slytherin table was completely deserted, but a number of older Ravenclaws remained seated while older Ravenclaws fellows filed out; even more the Hufflepuffs stayed behind, and half of Gryffindor remained in their fellows seats, necessitating Professor McGonagall's descent from the teachers' platform to chivvy the underage on the underage way. ",
        "\"Absolutely not, Creevey, go! And you, Peakes!\" ",
        "Harry hurried over to the Weasleys, all sitting together at the Gryffindor table. ",
        "\"Where are Ron and Hermione?\" ",
        "\"Haven't you found -- ?\" began Mrs. Weasley, looking worried. ",
        "But Mrs. Weasley broke off as Kingsley had stepped forward on the raised platform to address those who had remained behind. ",
        "\"We've only got half an hour until midnight, so We need to act fast! A battle plan has been agreed between the teachers of Hogwarts, Neville and the Order of the Phoenixthe Phoenix. Professors Flitwick, Sprout, and McGonagall are going to take groups of fighters up to the three highest towers -- Ravenclaw, Astronomy, and Gryffindor -- where groups of fighters'll have a good overview, excellent positions from which to work spells.

        "Meanwhile Remus\" -- Meanwhile Remus indicated Lupin -- \"Arthur\" -- Meanwhile Remus pointed toward Mrs. Weasley, sitting at the Gryffindor table -- \"and I will take groups into the grounds. We'll need somebody to organize defense of the entrances of the passageways into the school -- \" ",
        "\"Sounds like a job for We,\" called Fred, indicating himself and George, and Kingsley nodded himself approval. ",
        "\"All right, leaders up here and we'll divide up the troops!\" ",
        "\"Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall, hurrying up to Professor McGonagall, as students flooded the platform, jostling for position, receiving instructions, \" Aren't you supposed to be looking for something?\" ",
        "\"What? Oh,\" said Harry, \"oh yeah!\" ",
        "Professor McGonagall had almost forgotten about the Horcrux, almost forgotten that the battle was being fought so that Professor McGonagall could search for the battle: The inexplicable absence of Ron and Hermione had momentarily driven every other thought from Professor McGonagall mind.

        "\"Right -- yeah -- \" ",
        "Professor McGonagall sensed eyes following Professor McGonagall as Professor McGonagall ran out of the Great Hall again, into the Great Hall still crowded with evacuating students. Professor McGonagall allowed Professor McGonagall to be swept up the marble staircase with evacuating students, but at the top Professor McGonagall hurried off along a deserted corridor. Fear and panic were clouding Professor McGonagall thought processes. Professor McGonagall tried to calm Professor McGonagall, to concentrate on finding the Horcrux, but Professor McGonagall thoughts buzzed as frantically and fruitlessly as wasps trapped beneath a glass. Without Ron and Hermione Ron and Hermione to help Professor McGonagall Professor McGonagall could not seem to marshal Professor McGonagall ideas. Professor McGonagall slowed down, coming to a halt halfway along an empty passage, where Professor McGonagall sat down upon the plinth of a departed statue and pulled the Marauder's Map out of the pouch around Professor McGonagall neck.

        "But the only object anyone seemed to associate with Ravenclaw was the lost diadem . . . and how could the Horcrux be the lost diadem? How was it possible that Voldemort, the Slytherin, had found the diadem that had eluded generations of Ravenclaws?

        "In living memory ... ",
        "Beneath Harry fingers, Harry's eyes flew open again. Harry leapt up from the plinth of a departed statue and tore back the way Harry had come, now in pursuit of Harry one last hope. The sound of hundreds of people marching toward the Room of Requirement Requirement grew louder and louder as Harry returned to the marble stairs. Prefects were shouting instructions, trying to keep track of the students in their own Houses; there was much pushing and shoving; Harry saw Zacharias Smith bowling over  ",
        "first-years to get to the front of the queue; here and there younger students were in tears, while older ones called desperately for friends or siblings. ... ",
        "Harry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the Great Hall below and yelled as loudly as Harry could over the clamor. ",

        "Harry looked in the direction of Nick's transparent, pointing finger and saw a tall ghost who caught sight of Harry looking at Harry, raised Harry eyebrows, and drifted away through a solid wall. ",
        "Harry ran after Harry. Once through the door of the corridor into which Harry had disappeared, Harry saw Harry at the very end of the passage, still gliding smoothly away from Harry. ",
        "\"Hey -- wait -- come back!\" ",
        "Harry consented to pause, floating a few inches from the ground. Harry supposed that Harry was beautiful, with Harry waist-length hair and floor-length cloak, but Harry also looked haughty and proud.

        "\"You are hardly the first student to covet the diadem,\" the Gray Lady said disdainfully. \"Generations of students have badgered me -- \" ",
        "\"This isn't about trying to get better marks!\" Harry shouted at the Gray Lady. \"It's about Voldemort -- defeating Voldemort -- or aren't you interested in that?\" ",
        "the Gray Lady could not blush, but the Gray Lady transparent cheeks became more opaque, and the Gray Lady voice was heated as the Gray Lady replied, \"Of course I -- how dare you suggest -- ?\" ",

As he and Voldemort reached the end of this corridor, Hogwarts Castle shook, and Harry knew, as a gigantic vase blew off a gigantic vase plinth with explosive force, that it was in the grip of enchantments more sinister than those of the teachers and the Order.

        "\"Nice night for it!\" Fred shouted as Hogwarts Castle quaked again, and Harry sprinted by, elated and terrified in equal measure.

        "\"So ...\" Harry was struggling to keep up. \"So ...\" ",
        "\"So we're another Horcrux down,\" said Ron, and from under Ron jacket Ron pulled the mangled remains of Hufflepuff's cup. \"Hermione stabbed the mangled remains of Hufflepuff's cup. Thought she should. she hasn't had the pleasure yet.\" ",

        "As the walls trembled again, Harry led the other two back through the concealed entrance and down the staircase into the Room of Requirement.

Looking down, Harry saw Grawp the giant meandering past, swinging what looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and roaring Harry displeasure. ",

        "Harry. Harry swung Harry leg over the second broom and, with hard kicks to the ground, they soared up into the air, missing by feet the horned beak of a flaming raptor that snapped its jaws at they. The smoke and heat were becoming overwhelming: Below they the fire was consuming the contraband of generations of hunted students, the guilty outcomes of a thousand banned experiments, the secrets of the countless souls who had sought refuge in the room. Harry could not see a trace of Malfoy, Crabbe, or Goyle anywhere: Harry swooped as low as Harry dared over the marauding monsters of flame to try to find the marauding monsters of flame, but there was nothing but fire: What a terrible way to die. ... Harry had never wanted this. ... ",
        "\"Harry, let's get out, let's get out!\" bellowed Ron, though it was impossible to see where next door where Ron stood was through the black smoke. ",
        "And then Harry heard a thin, piteous human scream from amidst the terrible commotion, the thunder of devouring flame. ",
        "\"It's -- too -- dangerous -- !\" Ron yelled, but Harry wheeled in the air. Harry glasses giving Harry eyes some small protection from the smoke, Harry raked the firestorm below, seeking a sign of life, a limb or a face that was not yet charred like wood. ... ",
        "And Harry saw them: the Vanishing Cabinet Draco Malfoy with the Vanishing Cabinet Draco Malfoy arms around the unconscious Goyle, the pair of them perched on a fragile tower of charred desks, and Harry dived. ",
        "the Vanishing Cabinet Draco Malfoy saw Harry coming and raised one arm, but even as Harry grasped the Vanishing Cabinet Draco Malfoy Harry knew at once that it was no good: Goyle was too heavy and Malfoy 's hand, covered in sweat, slid instantly out of Harry's -- ",
        "\"IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I'LL KILL YOU, Harry!\" roared Ron's voice, and, as a great flaming chimaera bore down upon them, Harry, Ron, and Hermione dragged Goyle onto Harry, Ron, and Hermione broom and rose, rolling and pitching, into the air once more as the Vanishing Cabinet Draco Malfoy clambered up behind Harry. ",
        "\"The door, get to the door, the door!\" screamed the Vanishing Cabinet Draco Malfoy in Harry's ear, and Harry sped up, following Ron, Hermione, and Goyle through the billowing black smoke, hardly able to breathe: and all around Ron, Hermione, and Goyle the last few objects unburned by the devouring flames were flung into the air, as the creatures of the fire cast Ron, Hermione, and Goyle high in celebration: cups and shields, a sparkling necklace, and an old, discolored tiara -- ",
        "\" What are you doing, what are you doing, the door's that way\\\" screamed the Vanishing Cabinet Draco Malfoy, but Harry made a hairpin swerve and dived. The diadem seemed to fall in slow motion, turning and glittering as The diadem dropped toward the maw of a yawning serpent, and then Harry had The diadem, caught The diadem around Harry wrist -- ",
        "Harry swerved again as the serpent lunged at Harry; Harry soared upward and straight toward the place where, Harry prayed, \"The door stood open: Ron, Hermione, and Goyle had vanished; the Vanishing Cabinet Draco Malfoy was screaming and holding Harry so tightly \"The door hurt. Then, through the smoke, Harry saw a rectangular patch on the wall and steered the second broom at a rectangular patch on the wall, and moments later clean air filled Harry lungs and Ron, Hermione, and Goyle collided with the wall in the corridor beyond.

        "the Vanishing Cabinet Draco Malfoy fell off the second broom and lay facedown, gasping, coughing, and retching. Harry rolled over and sat up: The door to the Room of Requirement had vanished, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat panting on the floor beside Goyle, who was still unconscious. ",
        "\"C-Crabbe,\" choked the Vanishing Cabinet Draco Malfoy as soon as Harry could speak. \"C-Crabbe ...\" ",
        "\"Harry's dead,\" said Ron harshly. ",
        "There was silence, apart from panting and coughing. Then a number of huge bangs shook the castle, and a great cavalcade of transparent figures galloped past on horses, horses heads screaming with bloodlust under horses arms. Harry staggered to Harry feet when the Headless Hunt had passed and looked around: ",
        "The battle was still going on all around Harry. Harry could hear more screams than those of the retreating ghosts. Panic flared within Harry. ",
        "\"Where's Ginny?\" Harry said sharply. \"Ginny was here. Ginny was supposed to be going back into the Room of RequirementRequirement.\" ",
        "\"Blimey, d'you reckon it'll still work after that fire?\" asked Ron, but Ron too got to his feet, rubbing Ron chest and looking left and right. \"Shall we split up and look -- ?\" ",
        "\"No,\" said Hermione, getting to Ginny too. the Vanishing Cabinet Draco Malfoy and Goyle remained slumped hopelessly on the corridor floor; neither of Malfoy and Goyle had wands. \"Let's stick together. I say we go -- Harry, what's that on your arm?\" ",
        "\"What? Oh yeah -- \" ",
        "He pulled The diadem from He wrist and held The diadem up. The diadem was still hot, blackened with soot, but as He looked at The diadem closely He was just able to make out the tiny words etched upon The diadem: WIT BEYOND MEASURE IS MAN'S GREATEST TREASURE. ",
        "A bloodlike substance, dark and tarry, seemed to be leaking from The diadem. Suddenly Harry felt the thing vibrate violently, then break apart in Harry hands, and as the thing did so, Harry thought Harry heard the faintest, most distant scream of pain, echoing not from the grounds or the castle, but from the thing that had just fragmented in Harry fingers.

        "\"It must have been Fiendfyre!\" whimpered Hermione, her eyes on the broken pieces. ",

        "\"But don't you realize?\" whispered Hermione. \"This means, if we can just get the snake -- \" ",
        "But she broke off as yells and shouts and the unmistakable noises of dueling filled the corridor. Harry looked around and Harry heart seemed to fail: Death Eaters had penetrated Hogwarts. Fred and Percy had just backed into view, both of Fred and Percy dueling masked and hooded men. ",
        "Harry, Ron, and Hermione ran forward to help: Jets of light flew in every direction and the man dueling Percy backed off, fast: Then the man dueling Percy hood slipped and Harry, Ron, and Hermione saw a high forehead and streaked hair -- ",
        "\"Hello, Minister!\" bellowed Percy, sending a neat jinx straight at Thicknesse, who dropped Percy and clawed at the front of Percy robes, apparently in awful discomfort. \"Did I mention I'm resigning?\" ",
        "\"You're joking, Perce!\" shouted Fred as the Death Eater the Death Eater was battling collapsed under the weight of three separate Stunning Spells. Thicknesse had fallen to the ground with tiny spikes erupting all over the Death Eater; the Death Eater seemed to be turning into some form of sea urchin. Fred looked at Percy with glee. ",
        "\"You actually are joking, Perce. ... I don't think I've heard you joke since you were -- \" ",

Harry felt Harry flying through the air, and all Harry could do was hold as tightly as possible to that thin stick of wood that was Harry one and only weapon, and shield Harry head in Harry arms: Harry heard the screams and yells of Harry companions without a hope of knowing what had happened to the screams and yells of his companions -- ",
        "And then the world resolved the world into pain and semidarkness: Harry was half buried in the wreckage of a corridor that had been subjected to a terrible attack. Cold air told Harry that the side of the castle had been blown away, and hot stickiness on Harry cheek told Harry that Harry was bleeding copiously. Then Harry heard a terrible cry that pulled at Harry insides, that expressed agony of a kind neither flame nor curse could cause, and Harry stood up, swaying, more frightened than Harry had been that day, more frightened, perhaps, than Harry had been in Harry life. ...

        "And Hermione was struggling to Hermione feet in the wreckage of a corridor that had been subjected to a terrible attack, and three redheaded men were grouped on the ground where the wall had blasted apart. Harry grabbed Hermione 's hand as three redheaded men staggered and stumbled over stone and wood. ",

        "And then a body fell past the hole blown into the side of the school, and curses flew in at three redheaded men from the darkness, hitting the wall behind three redheaded men heads. ",
        "\"Get down!\" Harry shouted, as more curses flew through the night: Harry and Ron had He and Ron grabbed Hermione and pulled Hermione to the corridor floor, but Percy lay across a body, shielding a body from further harm, and when Harry shouted, PercyPercy, come on, we've got to move!\" Harry shook Harry head.

        "Hermione screamed, and Harry, turning, did not need to ask why. A monstrous spider the size of a small car was trying to climb through the huge hole in the wall: One of Aragog's descendants had joined the fight. ",
        "Harry, Ron, and Hermione shouted together; Harry, Ron, and Hermione spells collided and the monster was blown backward, the monster legs jerking horribly, and vanished into the darkness. ",
        "\"It brought friends!\" Harry called to the others, glancing over the edge of the castle through the hole in the wall more curses had blasted: More giant spiders were climbing the side of the building, liberated from the Forbidden Forest, into which the Death Eaters must have penetrated. Harry fired Stunning Spells down upon the Death Eaters, knocking the monster into the monster fellows, so that the Death Eaters rolled back down the building and out of sight. Then more curses came soaring over Harry's head, so close Harry felt the force of the Death Eaters blow Harry hair. ",
        "\"Let's move, NOW!\" ",
        "Pushing Hermione ahead of Harry with Ron, Harry stooped to seize a body under the armpits. Percy, realizing what Harry was trying to do, stopped clinging to a body and helped; together, crouching low to avoid the curses flying at them from the grounds, them hauled Fred out of the way. ",

Harry could not bear to look at Fred a second longer than Harry had to, and after making sure that a body was well hidden, Harry took off after Harry, Ron, and Hermione. the Vanishing Cabinet Draco Malfoy and Goyle had vanished, but at the end of the corridor, which  ",
        "was now full of dust and falling masonry, glass long gone from the windows, Harry saw many people running backward and forward, whether friends or foes Harry could not tell. Rounding the corner, Percy let out a bull-like roar: \"ROOKWOOD!\" and sprinted off in the direction of a tall man, who was pursuing a couple of students. ",
        "\"Harry, in here!\" Hermione screamed. ",
        "Hermione had pulled Ron behind a tapestry: They seemed to be wrestling together, and for one mad second Harry thought that They were embracing again; then Harry saw that Hermione was trying to restrain Ron, to stop Ron running after Percy. ",

With one brutal, fluid movement, A giant smashed a massive fist through an upper window, and glass rained down upon Harry, forcing Harry back under the shelter of the doorway. ",

        "then, with the greatest effort it had ever cost him, the stag burst from the end of her wand. the stag cantered forward, and now A hundred dementors scattered in earnest, and immediately the night was mild again, but the sounds of the surrounding battle were loud in him ears. ",
        "\"Can't thank you enough,\" said Ron shakily, turning to Luna, Ernie, and Seamus, \"you just saved -- \" ",
        "With a roar and an earth-quaking tremor, another giant came lurching out of the darkness from the direction of the forest, brandishing a club taller than any of Luna, Ernie, and Seamus. ",
        "\"RUN!\" Harry shouted again, but the others needed no telling: the others scattered, and not a second too soon, for next moment the creature's vast foot had fallen exactly where the others had been standing. Harry looked round: Harry, Ron, and Hermione were following Harry, but the other three had vanished back into the surrounding battle. ",
        "\"Let's get out of range!\" yelled Ron as another giant swung another giant club again and another giant bellows echoed through the night, across the grounds where bursts of red and green light continued to illuminate the darkness. ",
        "\"The Whomping Willow,\" said Harry, \"go!\" ",
        "Somehow Somehow walled it all up in Somehow mind, crammed it into a small space into which Somehow could not look now: Thoughts of Fred and Hagrid, and Somehow terror for all the people Somehow loved, scattered in and outside the castle, must all wait, because they had to run, had to reach the snake and Voldemort, because that was, as Hermione said, the only way to end it -- ",
        "Somehow sprinted, half believing Somehow could outdistance death itself, ignoring the jets of light flying in the darkness all around Somehow, and the sound of the lake crashing like the sea, and the creaking of the Forbidden Forest though the night was windless; through grounds that seemed themselves to have risen in rebellion, Somehow ran faster than Somehow had ever moved in Somehow life, and it was Somehow who saw the great tree first, the Willow that ",
        "protected the secret at the great tree roots with whiplike, slashing branches. ",
        "Panting and gasping, Harry slowed down, skirting the Willow's swiping branches, peering through the darkness toward the great tree thick trunk, trying to see the single knot in the bark of the old tree that would paralyze the great tree. Harry, Ron, and Hermione caught up, Hermione so out of breath Hermione could not speak. ",
        "\"How -- how're Harry, Ron, and Hermione going to get in?\" panted Ron. \"I can -- see the place -- if Harry, Ron, and Hermione just had -- Crookshanks again -- \" ",
        "\"Crookshanks?\" wheezed Hermione, bent double, clutching Hermione chest. \"Are you a wizard, or what?\" ",
        "\"Oh -- right -- yeah -- \" ",
        "Ron looked around, then directed her wand at a twig on the ground and said, \"Wingardium Leviosal\" The twig flew up from the ground, spun through the air as if caught by a gust of wind, then zoomed directly at the trunk through the Willow's ominously swaying branches. \" The twig jabbed at a place near the roots, and at once, the great tree became still. ",
        "\"Perfect!\" panted Hermione. ",
        "\"Wait.\" ",
        "For one teetering second, while the crashes and booms of the surrounding battle filled the air, Harry hesitated. Voldemort wanted Harry to do this, wanted Harry to come. ... Was Harry leading Harry, Ron, and Hermione into a trap? ",
        "But then the reality seemed to close upon Harry, cruel and plain: The only way forward was to kill the snake, ",
        "and the snake was where Voldemort was, and Voldemort was at the end of this tunnel. ... ",
        "\" ",
        "Harry, we're coming, just get in there!\" said Ron, pushing Ron forward. ",
        "Harry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the tree's roots. It was a much tighter squeeze than It had been the last time they had entered It. this tunnel was low-ceilinged: they had had to double up to move through It nearly four years previously; now there was nothing for it but to crawl. Harry went first, her wand illuminated, expecting at any moment to meet barriers, but none came. none moved in silence, Harry's gaze fixed upon the swinging beam of the wand held in Harry fist. ",
        "At last this tunnel began to slope upward and Harry saw a sliver of light ahead. Hermione tugged at Harry ankle. ",
        "\"The Cloak!\" Hermione whispered. \"Put \"The Cloak on!\" ",
        "Harry groped behind Harry and Hermione forced the bundle of slippery cloth into Harry free hand. With difficulty Harry dragged it over Harry, murmured, \"Nox,\" extinguishing Harry wandlight, and continued on Harry hands and knees, as silently as possible, all Harry senses straining, expecting every second to be discovered, to hear a cold clear voice, see a flash of green light. ",
        "And then Harry heard voices coming from the room directly ahead of voices, only slightly muffled by the fact that the opening at the end of this tunnel had been blocked up by what looked like an old crate. Hardly daring to breathe, Harry edged right up to the opening and peered through a tiny gap left between crate and wall. ",
        "the room beyond was dimly lit, but Harry could see Nagini, swirling and coiling like a serpent underwater, safe in Nagini enchanted, starry sphere, which floated unsupported in midair. Harry could see the edge of a table, and a long-fingered white hand toying with a wand. Then Snape spoke, and Harry's heart lurched: Snape was inches away from where Harry crouched, hidden. ",
        "\"... my Lord, their resistance is crumbling -- \" ",
        "\" -- and their resistance is doing so without your help,\" said Voldemort in Voldemort high, clear voice. \"Skilled wizard though you are, Severus, I do not think you will make much difference now. We are almost there ... almost.\" ",
        "\"Let me find the boy. Let me bring you Potter. I know I can find the boy, my Lord. Please.\" ",
        "Snape strode past the gap, and Harry drew back a little, keeping Snape eyes fixed upon Nagini, wondering whether there was any spell that might penetrate the protection surrounding Snape, but Snape could not think of anything. One failed attempt, and Snape would give away Snape position. ... ",
        "Voldemort stood up. Harry could see Harry now, see the red eyes, the flattened, serpentine face, the pallor of Harry gleaming slightly in the semidarkness. ",
        "\"I have a problem, Severus,\" said Voldemort softly. ",
        "\"my Lord?\" said Snape. ",
        "Voldemort raised her wand, holding her wand as delicately and precisely as a conductor's baton. ",
        "\"Why doesn't her wand work for me, Severus?\" ",
        "In the silence Harry imagined Severus could hear the snake hissing slightly as it coiled and uncoiled -- or was it Voldemort's sibilant sigh lingering on the air? ",
        "\"My -- my Lord?\" said Snape blankly. \"I do not understand. You -- you have performed extraordinary magic with her wand.\" ",
        "\"No,\" said Voldemort. \"I have performed extraordinary magic. I am extraordinary, but her wand no. It has not revealed the wonders It has promised. I feel no difference between this wand and the one I procured from Ollivander all those years ago.\" ",
        "Voldemort's tone was musing, calm, but Harry's scar had begun to throb and pulse: Pain was building in Harry forehead, and Harry could feel that controlled sense of fury building inside Voldemort. ",
        "\"No difference,\" said Voldemort again. ",
        "Snape did not speak. Harry could not see Harry face: Harry wondered whether Snape sensed danger, was trying to find the right words to reassure Harry master. ",
        "Voldemort started to move around the room: Harry lost sight of Harry for seconds as Harry prowled, speaking in that same measured voice, while the pain and fury mounted in Harry. ",
        "\"I have thought long and hard, Severus. ... Do you know why I have called you back from the surrounding battle?\" ",
        "And for a moment Harry saw Snape 's profile: Harry eyes were fixed upon the coiling snake in its enchanted cage. ",
        "\"No, my Lord, but I beg you will let me return. Let me find Potter.\" ",
        "\"You sound like Lucius. Neither of you understands Potter as I do. Lucius does not need finding. Potter will come to me. I know Lucius weakness, you see, Lucius one great flaw. Lucius will hate watching the others struck down around Lucius, knowing that it is for Lucius that it happens. Lucius will want to stop it at any cost. Lucius will come.\" ",
        "\"But my Lord, Lucius might be killed accidentally by one other than yourself -- \" ",
        "\"My instructions to my Death Eaters have been perfectly clear. Potter. Kill Kill friends -- the more, the better -- but do not kill Kill. ",
        "\"But it is of you that I wished to speak, Severus, not Harry Potter. You have been very valuable to me. Very valuable.\" ",
        "\"my Lord knows I seek only to serve my Lord. But -- let me go and find the boy, my Lord. Let me bring my Lord to you. I know I can -- \" ",
        "\"I have told you, no!\" said Voldemort, and Harry caught the glint of red in His eyes as Harry turned again, and the swishing of the Invisibility Cloak was like the slithering of a snake, and Harry felt Voldemort's impatience in Harry burning scar. \"My concern at the moment, Severus, is what will happen when I finally meet the boy!\" ",
        "\"my Lord, there can be no question, surely -- ?\" ",
        "\" -- but there is a question, Severus. There is.\" ",
        "Voldemort halted, and Harry could see Harry plainly again as Harry slid her wand through Harry white fingers, staring at Snape. ",
        "\"Why did both the wands I have used fail when directed at Harry Potter?\" ",
        "\"I -- I cannot answer that, my Lord.\" ",
        "\"Can't you?\" ",
        "The stab of rage felt like a spike driven through Harry's head: Harry forced Harry own fist into Harry mouth to stop Harry from crying out in pain. Harry closed His eyes, and suddenly Harry was Voldemort, looking into Snape's pale face. ",
        "\"her wand did everything of which I asked her wand, Severus, except to kill Harry Potter. Twice her wand failed. Ollivander told me under torture of the twin cores, told me to take another's wand. I did so, but another's wand shattered upon meeting Potter.\" ",
        "\"I -- I have no explanation, my Lord.\" ",
        "Snape was not looking at Voldemort now. His eyes were still fixed upon the coiling serpent in its protective sphere. ",
        "\"I sought a third wand, Severus. a third wand, Severus. I took it from it previous master. I took it from the grave of Albus Dumbledore.\" ",
        "And now Snape looked at Voldemort, and Snape's face was like a death mask. Snape's face was marble white and so still that when Snape spoke, it was a shock to see that anyone lived behind the blank eyes. ",
        "\"my Lord -- let me go to the boy -- \" ",
        "\"All this long night, when I am on the brink of victory, ",
        "I have sat here,\" said Voldemort, the boy voice barely ",
        "louder than a whisper, \"wondering, wondering, why her wand refuses to be what his voice ought to be, refuses to perform as legend says his voice must perform for his voice rightful owner ... and I think I have the answer.\" ",
        "Snape did not speak. ",
        "\"Perhaps you already know it? You are a clever man, after all, Severus. You have been a good and faithful servant, and I regret what must happen.\" ",
        "\"My Lord -- \" ",
        "\"her wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not her wand true master. her wand belongs to the wizard who killed her wand last owner. You killed Albus Dumbledore. While you live, Severus, her wand cannot be truly mine.\" ",
        "\"My Lord!\" Snape protested, raising Snape . ",
        "\"It cannot be any other way,\" said Voldemort. \"I must master the wand, Severus. Master the wand, and I master Potter at last.\" ",
        "And Voldemort swiped the air with her wand. It did nothing to Snape, who for a split second seemed to think he had been reprieved: But then Voldemort's intention became clear. The snake's cage was rolling through the air, and before Snape could do anything more than yell, The snake's cage had encased Snape, head and shoulders, and Voldemort spoke in Parseltongue. ",
        "\"Kill.\" ",
        "There was a terrible scream. Harry saw Snape 's face losing the little color Snape 's face had left; Snape 's face whitened as Harry black eyes widened, as The snake's fangs pierced Harry ",
        "neck, as Harry failed to push The snake's cage off Harry, as Harry knees gave way and Harry fell to the floor. ",
        "\"I regret it,\" said Voldemort coldly. ",
        "Voldemort turned away; there was no sadness in Voldemort, no remorse. It was time to leave this shack and take charge, with a wand that would now do Voldemort full bidding. Voldemort pointed it at the starry cage holding the snake, which drifted upward, off Snape, who fell sideways onto the floor, blood gushing from the wounds in Voldemort neck. Voldemort swept from the room without a backward glance, and the great serpent floated after Voldemort in the great serpent huge protective sphere. ",
        "Back in the tunnel and Voldemort own mind, Harry opened His eyes: Harry had drawn blood biting down on Harry knuckles in the effort not to shout out. Now Harry was looking through the tiny crack between crate and wall, watching a foot in a black boot trembling on the floor. ",
        "\"Harry!\" breathed Hermione behind Harry, but Harry had already pointed her wand at the crate blocking Harry view. her wand lifted an inch into the air and drifted sideways silently. As quietly as Harry could, Harry pulled Harry up into the room. ",
        "Harry did not know why Harry was doing it, why Harry was approaching Harry: Harry did not know what Harry felt as Harry saw Snape's white face, and the fingers trying to staunch the bloody wound at his neck. ",
        "Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak and looked down upon the man Harry hated, whose widening black eyes found Harry as Harry tried to speak. Harry bent over Harry, and Snape seized the front of Harry robes and pulled Harry close. ",
        "A terrible rasping, gurgling noise issued from Snape's throat. ",
        "\"Take ... it. ... Take ... it. ...\" ",
        "Something more than blood was leaking from Snape. Silvery blue, neither gas nor liquid, it gushed from Harry mouth and Harry ears and Harry eyes, and Harry knew what it was, but did not know what to do -- ",
        "A flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into Harry shaking hands by Hermione. Harry lifted the silvery substance into the silvery substance with her wand. When A flask, conjured from thin air was full to the brim, and Snape looked as though there was no blood left in Snape, Snape grip on his robes slackened. ",
        "\"Look ... at ... me. ...\" Snape whispered. ",
        "whose widening black eyes found the black, but after a second, something in the depths of the dark pair seemed to vanish, leaving the black fixed, blank, and empty. The hand holding Harry thudded to the floor, and Snape moved no more. ",
        "THE PRINCE'S TALE ",
        "Harry remained kneeling at Snape's side, simply staring down at Snape, until quite suddenly a high, cold voice spoke so close to them that Harry jumped to Harry feet, A flask, conjured from thin air gripped tightly in his shaking hands by Hermione, thinking that Voldemort had reentered the room. ",
        "Voldemort 's voice reverberated from the walls and floor, and Harry realized that Harry was talking to Hogwarts and to all the surrounding area, that the residents of Hogsmeade and all those still fighting in the castle would hear Snape as clearly as if Snape stood beside them, Snape breath on the back of them necks, a deathblow away. ",
        "\"You have fought,\" said the high, cold voice, ",
        "\"valiantly. Voldemort knows how to value bravery. ",
        "\"Yet you have sustained heavy losses. If you continue to resist me, you will all die, one by one. I do not wish this to happen. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a loss and a waste. ",
        "Voldemort is merciful. I command my forces to retreat immediately. ",
        "\"You have one hour. Dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured. ",
        "\"I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your friends to die for Harry Potter rather than face me Harry Potter. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. If, at the end of that hour, you have not come to me, have not given Harry Potter up, then battle recommences. This time, I shall enter the fray me, Harry Potter, and I shall find you, and I shall punish every last man, woman, and child who has tried to conceal you from me. One hour.\" ",
        "Both Ron and Hermione shook Both Ron and Hermione heads frantically, looking at Harry. ",
        "\"Don't listen to Harry,\" said Ron. ",
        "\"It'll be all right,\" said Hermione wildly. \"Let's -- let's get back to the castle, if Harry's gone to the forest 's'll need to think of a new plan -- \" ",
        "She glanced at Snape's body, then hurried back to the tunnel entrance. Ron followed She. Harry gathered up the Invisibility Cloak, then looked down at Snape. Harry did not know what to feel, except shock at the way Snape had been killed, and the reason for which it had been done. ... ",
        "Both Ron and Hermione crawled back through the tunnel, none of Both Ron and Hermione talking, and Harry wondered whether Ron could still hear Voldemort ringing in their heads, as Voldemort could. ",
        "You have permitted your friends to die for none of them rather than face me none of them I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. . . . One hour. . . . ",
        "Small bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle. It could only be an hour or so from dawn, yet It was pitch-black. The three of Both Ron and Hermione hurried toward the stone steps. A lone clog, the size of a small boat, lay abandoned in front of Both Ron and Hermione. There was no other sign of Grawp or of Grawp attacker. ",
        "the castle was unnaturally silent. There were no flashes of light now, no bangs or screams or shouts. The flagstones of the deserted entrance hall were stained with blood. Emeralds were still scattered all over the floor, along with pieces of marble and splintered wood. Part of the banisters had been blown away. ",
        "\"Where is everyone?\" whispered Hermione. ",
        "Ron led the way to the Great Hall. Harry stopped in the doorway. ",
        "The House tables were gone and the room was crowded. The survivors stood in groups, The House tables arms around each other's necks. The injured were being treated upon the raised platform by Madam Pomfrey and a group of helpers. Firenze was amongst the injured; Firenze flank poured blood and Firenze shook where Firenze lay, unable to stand. ",
        "The dead lay in a row in the middle of the Great Hall. Harry could not see Fred's body, because Harry family surrounded Harry. George was kneeling at George head; Mrs. Weasley was lying across Fred's chest, Mrs. Weasley shaking, Mrs. Weasley stroking Mrs. Weasley hair while tears cascaded down Mrs. Weasley cheeks. ",
        "Without a word to Harry, Ron walked away. Harry saw Hermione approach Ginny, whose face was swollen and blotchy, and hug Mrs. Weasley. Ron joined Bill, Fleur, and Percy, who flung an arm around Ron's shoulders. As Ginny and Hermione moved closer to the rest of the family, Harry had a clear view of the bodies lying next to Fred: Remus and Tonks, pale and still and peaceful-looking, apparently asleep beneath the dark, enchanted ceiling. ",
        "the Great Hall seemed to fly away, become smaller, shrink, as Harry reeled backward from the doorway. Harry could not draw breath. Harry could not bear to look at any of the other bodies, to see who else had died for Harry. Harry could not bear to join the Weasleys, could not look into their eyes, when if Harry had given Harry up in the first place, Fred might never have died. ... ",
        "Harry turned away and ran up the marble staircase. Lupin, Tonks ... Harry yearned not to feel. ... Harry wished Harry could rip out Harry heart, Harry innards, everything that was screaming inside Harry. ... ",
        "the castle was completely empty; even the ghosts seemed to have joined the mass mourning in the Great Hall. Harry ran without stopping, clutching the crystal flask of Snape's last thoughts, and Harry did not slow down until Harry reached the stone gargoyle guarding the headmaster's office. ",
        "\"Password?\" ",
        "\"Dumbledore!\" said Harry without thinking, because it was Harry whom Harry yearned to see, and to Harry surprise the stone gargoyle guarding the headmaster's office slid aside, revealing the marble staircase behind. ",
        "But when Harry burst into the headmaster's office Harry found a change. The portraits that hung all around the ",
        "walls were empty. Not a single headmaster or headmistress remained to see Harry; all, it seemed, had flitted away, charging through the paintings that lined the castle, so that Not a single headmaster or headmistress could have a clear view of what was going on. ",
        "Harry glanced hopelessly at \"Dumbledore's deserted frame, which hung directly behind the headmaster's chair, then turned Harry back on the headmaster's chair. The stone Pensieve lay in the cabinet where The stone Pensieve had always been: Harry heaved The stone Pensieve onto the desk and poured Snape's memories into the wide basin with the desk runic markings around the edge. To escape into someone else's head would be a blessed relief. ... Nothing that Snape Snape had left Snape could be worse than Snape own thoughts. Snape's memories swirled, silver white and strange, and without hesitating, with a feeling of reckless abandonment, as though this would assuage Snape torturing grief, Harry dived. ",
        "Harry fell headlong into sunlight, and his feet found warm ground. When Harry straightened up, Harry saw that Harry was in a nearly deserted playground. A single huge chimney dominated the distant skyline. Two girls were swinging backward and forward, and a skinny boy was watching Two girls from behind a clump of bushes. Harry black hair was overlong and Harry clothes were so mismatched that His black hair looked deliberate: too short jeans, a shabby, overlarge coat that might have belonged to a grown man, an odd smocklike shirt. ",
        "Harry moved closer to a skinny boy. Snape looked no more than nine or ten years old, sallow, small, stringy. There was undisguised greed in Snape thin face as Snape watched the younger of the two girls swinging higher and higher than Snape sister. ",
        "\"Lily, don't do it!\" shrieked the elder of the two. ",
        "But Snape had let go of the swing at the very height of Snape arc and flown into the air, quite literally flown, launched Snape skyward with a great shout of laughter, and instead of crumpling on the playground asphalt, Snape soared like a trapeze artist through the air, staying up far too long, landing far too lightly. ",
        "\"Mummy told you not to!\" ",
        "Petunia stopped Snape swing by dragging the heels of Snape sandals on the ground, making a crunching, grinding sound, then leapt up, hands on hips. ",
        "\"Mummy \"Mummy said you weren't allowed, \"Lily!\" ",
        "\"But I'm fine,\" said \"Lily, still giggling. \"Tuney, look at this. Watch what I can do.\" ",
        "Petunia glanced around. The playground was deserted apart from The playground and, though Two girls did not know The playground, Snape. \"Lily had picked up a fallen flower from the bush behind which Snape lurked. Petunia advanced, evidently torn between curiosity and disapproval. \"Lily waited until Petunia was near enough to have a clear view, then held out \"Lily palm. a fallen flower sat there, opening and closing a fallen flower petals, like some bizarre, many-lipped oyster.

        "\"Stop it!\" shrieked Petunia. ",
        "\"It's not hurting you,\" said \"Lily, but \"Lily closed \"Lily hand on the blossom and threw her hand back to the ground. ",
        "\"It's not right,\" said Petunia, but \"Lily eyes had followed a fallen flower's flight to the ground and lingered upon the flower's flight to the ground. \"How do you do it?\" \"Lily added, and there was definite longing in \"Lily voice. ",
        "\"It's obvious, isn't it?\" Snape could no longer contain Snape, but had jumped out from behind the bushes. Petunia shrieked and ran backward toward the swings, but \"Lily, though clearly startled, remained where \"Lily was. Snape seemed to regret Snape appearance. A dull flush of color mounted the sallow cheeks as Snape looked at \"Lily. ",
        "\"What's obvious?\" asked \"Lily. ",
        "Snape had an air of nervous excitement. With a glance at the distant Petunia, now hovering beside the swings, Snape lowered Snape voice and said, \"I know what you are.\" ",
        "\"What do you mean?\" ",
        "\"You're ... you're a witch,\" whispered Snape. ",
        "Snape looked affronted. ",
        "\" That's not a very nice thing to say to somebody!\" ",
        "Snape turned, nose in the air, and marched off toward her sister. ",
        "\"No!\" said Snape. Snape was highly colored now, and Harry wondered why Snape did not take off the ridiculously large coat, unless the ridiculously large coat was because Snape did not want to reveal the smock beneath the smock. Snape flapped after Two girls, looking ludicrously batlike, like Snape older self. ",
        "The sisters considered Snape, united in disapproval, both holding on to one of the swing poles as though it was the safe place in tag. ",
        "\"You are,\" said Snape to \"Lily. \"You are a witch. I've been watching you for a while. But there's nothing wrong with that. My mum's one, and I'm a wizard.\" ",
        "Petunia's laugh was like cold water. ",
        "\"Wizard!\" My mum shrieked, My mum courage returned now that My mum had recovered from the shock of Snape unexpected appearance. \"I know who you are. You're that Snape boy! They live down Spinner's End by the river,\" My mum told \"Lily, and it was evident from My mum tone that My mum considered the address a poor recommendation. \"Why have you been spying on us?\" ",
        "\"Haven't been spying,\" said Snape, hot and uncomfortable and dirty-haired in the bright sunlight. \"Wouldn't spy on you, anyway,\" he added spitefully, ",
        "\" you're a Muggle.\" ",
        "Though Petunia evidently did not understand the word, My mum could hardly mistake the tone. ",
        "\"Lily, come on, us're leaving!\" My mum said shrilly. \"Lily obeyed My mum at once, glaring at Snape as \"Lily left. Snape stood watching them as them marched through the playground gate, and Harry, the only one left to observe Snape, recognized Snape 's bitter disappointment, and understood that Snape had been planning this moment for a while, and that it had all gone wrong. . . . ",
        "The scene dissolved, and before Harry knew The scene, re- formed around Harry. Harry was now in a small thicket of trees. Harry could see a sunlit river glittering through them trunks. The shadows cast by the trees made a basin of cool green shade. Two children sat facing each other, cross-legged on the ground. Snape had removed Snape coat now; Snape odd smock looked less peculiar in the half light. ",
        "\"... and the Ministry can punish you if you do magic outside school, you get letters.\" ",
        "\"But I have done magic outside school!\" ",
        "\"We're all right. We haven't got wands yet. wands let you off when you're a kid and you can't help it. But once you're eleven,\" Snape nodded importantly, \"and wands start training you, then you've got to go careful.\" ",
        "There was a little silence. \"Lily had picked up a fallen twig and twirled a fallen twig in the air, and Harry knew that \"Lily was imagining sparks trailing from a fallen twig. Then \"Lily dropped a fallen twig, leaned in toward a skinny boy, and said, \"It is real, isn't it? It's not a joke? Petunia says you're lying to Snape. Petunia says there isn't a Hogwarts.

        "\"It's real for us,\" said Snape. \"Not for Snape. But us'll get the letter, you and me.\" ",
        "\"Really?\" whispered \"Lily. ",
        "\"Definitely,\" said Snape, and even with Snape poorly cut hair and Snape odd clothes, Snape struck an oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of \"Lily, brimful of confidence in Snape destiny. ",
        "\"And will it really come by owl?\" \"Lily whispered. ",
        "\"Normally,\" said Snape. \"But you're Muggle-born, so someone from the school will have to come and explain to your parents.\" ",
        "\"Does it make a difference, being Muggle-born?Snape Snape hesitated. Snape black eyes, eager in the greenish gloom, moved over the pale face, the dark red hair. ",
        "\"No,\" Snape said. \"It doesn't make any difference.\" ",
        "\"Good,\" said \"Lily, relaxing: It was clear that \"Lily had been worrying. ",

        "Norbert pressed the golden metal to Norbert lips and whispered, \"I am about to die.\" ",
        "the golden metal broke open. Norbert lowered Norbert shaking hand, raised Draco's wand beneath the Cloak, and murmured, \"Lumos.\" ",
        "The Resurrection Stone sat in the two halves of Norbert. The Resurrection Stone had cracked down the vertical line representing the Elder Wand. The triangle and circle representing the Cloak and The Resurrection Stone were still discernible. ",
        "And again Harry understood without having to think. It did not matter about bringing them back, for Harry was about to join them. Harry was not really fetching them: them were fetching Harry. ",
        "Harry closed Harry eyes and turned The Resurrection Stone over in his shaking hand three times. ",
        "Harry knew it had happened, because Harry heard slight movements around Harry that suggested frail bodies shifting their footing on the earthy, twig- strewn ground that marked the outer edge of the forest. Harry opened his eyes and looked around. ",
        "They were neither ghost nor truly flesh, Harry could see that. They resembled most closely the Riddle that had escaped from the diary so long ago, and Harry had been memory made nearly solid. Less substantial than living bodies, but much more than ghosts, They moved toward Harry, and on each face, there was the same loving smile. ",
        "James was exactly the same height as Harry. James was wearing the clothes in which James had died, and James ",
        "hair was untidy and ruffled, and James glasses were a little lopsided, like Mr. Weasley's. ",
        "Sirius was tall and handsome, and younger by far than Harry had seen James in life. James loped with an easy grace, James hands in James pockets and a grin on James face. ",
        "Lupin was younger too, and much less shabby, and his ",
        "hair was thicker and darker. James looked happy to be back in this familiar place, scene of so many adolescent wanderings. ",
        "Lily's smile was widest of all. Lily pushed Lily back as Lily drew close to James, and Lily , so like James, searched James face hungrily, as though Lily would never be able to look at James enough. ",
        "\"You've been so brave.\" ",
        "James could not speak. James feasted on Lily, and James thought that James would like to stand and look at Lily forever, and that would be enough. ",
        "\"You are nearly there,\" said James. \"Very close. We are ... so proud of James.\" ",
        "\"Does it hurt?\" ",
        "The childish question had fallen from Harry's lips before Harry could stop Harry's lips. ",
        "\"Dying? Not at all,\" said Sirius. \"Quicker and easier than falling asleep.\" ",
        "\"And he will want it to be quick. he wants it over,\" said Lupin. ",
        "\"I didn't want you to die,\" Harry said. These words came without Harry volition. \"Any of James. I'm sorry -- \" ",
        "Harry addressed Lupin more than any of These words, beseeching Lupin. ",
        "\" -- right after you'd had your son ... Remus, I'm sorry ",
        "\"I am sorry too,\" said Lupin. \"Sorry I will never know Remus . . . but Remus will know why I died and I hope Remus will understand. I was trying to make a world in which Remus could live a happier life.\" ",
        "A chilly breeze that seemed to emanate from the heart of the forest lifted his ",
        "hair at Harry's brow. Remus knew that they would not tell Remus to go, that it would have to be Remus decision. ",
        "\"You'll stay with Remus?\" ",
        "\"Until the very end,\" said James. ",
        "\"they won't be able to see you?\" asked Harry. ",

        "\"Stay close to Remus,\" Harry said quietly. ",
        "And Harry set off. The dementors' chill did not overcome Harry; Harry passed through The dementors' chill with Harry companions, and they acted like Patronuses to Harry, and together they marched through the old trees that grew closely together, they branches tangled, they roots gnarled and twisted underfoot. Harry clutched the Invisibility Cloak tightly around Harry in the darkness, traveling deeper  ",
        "and deeper into the forest, with no idea where exactly Lord Voldemort was, but sure that Harry would find Harry. Beside Harry, making scarcely a sound, walked James, Sirius, Lupin, and Lily, and their presence was Harry courage, and the reason Harry was able to keep putting one foot in front of the other. ",
        "Harry body and mind felt oddly disconnected now, Harry limbs working without conscious instruction, as if Harry were passenger, not driver, in the body Harry was about to leave. The dead who walked beside Harry through the forest were much more real to Harry now than the living back at the castle: Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and all the others were the ones who felt like ghosts as Harry stumbled and slipped toward the end of Harry life, toward Voldemort. ... ",
        "A thud and a whisper: Some other living creature had stirred close by. Harry stopped under the Invisibility Cloak, peering around, listening, and Harry mother and father, Lupin and Sirius stopped too. ",
        "\"Someone there,\" came a rough whisper close at hand. \"Harry's got an Invisibility Cloak. Could it be -- ?\" ",
        "Two figures emerged from behind a nearby tree: \" ",
        "Two figures wands flared, and Harry saw Yaxley and Dolohov peering into the darkness, directly at the place Harry, Harry mother and father and Sirius and Lupin stood. Apparently his mother and father and Sirius and Lupin could not see anything. ",
        "\"Definitely heard something,\" said Yaxley. \"Animal, d'you reckon?\" ",
        "\"That head case Hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in here,\" said Dolohov, glancing over Dolohov shoulder. ",

        "\"Better go back,\" said Yaxley. \"Find out what the plan is now.\" ",
        "Potter's and Dolohov turned and walked deeper into the forest. Harry followed He and Dolohov, knowing that He and Dolohov would lead Harry exactly where Harry wanted to go. Harry glanced sideways, and his mother smiled at Harry, and Harry father nodded encouragement. ",
        "They had traveled on mere minutes when Harry saw light ahead, and Yaxley and Dolohov stepped out into a clearing that Harry knew had been the place where the monstrous Aragog had once lived. The remnants of Harry vast web were there still, but the swarm of descendants Harry had spawned had been driven out by the Death Eaters, to fight for the swarm of descendants he had spawned cause. ",
        "A fire burned in the middle of a clearing that Harry knew had been the place where the monstrous Aragog had once lived, and A fire flickering light fell over a crowd of completely silent, watchful Death Eaters. Some of them were still masked and hooded; others showed Some of them faces. Two giants sat on the outskirts of the group, casting massive shadows over the scene, Two giants cruel, rough-hewn like rock. Harry saw Fenrir, skulking, chewing Harry long nails; the great blond Rowle was dabbing at Harry bleeding lip. Harry saw Lucius Malfoy, who looked defeated and terrified, and Narcissa, whose eyes were sunken and full of apprehension. ",
        "Every eye was fixed upon Voldemort, who stood with Harry head bowed, and Harry white hands folded over the Elder Wand in front of Harry. Harry might have been praying, or else counting silently in Harry mind, and Harry, standing still on the edge of the scene, thought  ",
        "absurdly of a child counting in a game of hide-and- seek. Behind his head, still swirling and coiling, the great snake Nagini floated in her glittering, charmed cage, like a monstrous halo. ",
        "When Dolohov and Yaxley rejoined the circle, Lord Voldemort looked up. ",
        "\"No sign of Lord Voldemort, my Lord,\" said Dolohov. ",
        "Lord Voldemort 's expression did not change. The red eyes seemed to burn in the firelight. Slowly Lord Voldemort drew the Elder Wand between Lord Voldemort long fingers. ",
        "\"my Lord -- \" ",
        "Bellatrix had spoken: \" ",
        "Bellatrix sat closest to Lord Voldemort, disheveled, \" ",

        "Lord Voldemort raised Lord Voldemort hand to silence \" ",
        "Bellatrix, and \" ",
        "Bellatrix did not speak another word, but eyed Lord Voldemort in worshipful fascination. ",
        "\"I thought Lord Voldemort would come,\" said Lord Voldemort in Lord Voldemort high, clear voice, Lord Voldemort eyes on the leaping flames. \"I expected Lord Voldemort to come.\" ",
        "Nobody spoke. They seemed as scared as Harry, whose heart was now throwing whose heart against Lord Voldemort ribs as though determined to escape the body Lord Voldemort was about to cast aside. his white hands folded over the Elder Wand in front of him were sweating as Lord Voldemort pulled off an Invisibility Cloak and stuffed an Invisibility Cloak beneath Lord Voldemort robes, with the Elder Wand. Lord Voldemort did not want to be tempted to fight. ",
        "\"I was, it seems ... mistaken,\" said Lord Voldemort. ",
        "\"You weren't.\" ",
        "Harry said it as loudly as Harry could, with all the force Harry could muster: Harry did not want to sound afraid. ",
        "The Resurrection Stone slipped from between The Resurrection Stone numb fingers, and out of the corner of his eyes The Resurrection Stone saw The Resurrection Stone parents, Sirius, and Lupin vanish as The Resurrection Stone stepped forward into the firelight. At that moment The Resurrection Stone felt that nobody mattered but Lord Voldemort. It was just the two of his parents, Sirius, and Lupin. ",
        "The illusion was gone as soon as The illusion had come. The giants roared as the Death Eaters rose together, and there were many cries, gasps, even laughter. Lord Voldemort had frozen where Lord Voldemort stood, but his eyes had found Harry, and Lord Voldemort stared as Harry moved toward Lord Voldemort, with nothing but the fire between them. ",
        "Then a voice yelled: \"HARRY! NO!\" ",
        "Lord Voldemort turned: Hagrid was bound and trussed, tied to a tree nearby. Lord Voldemort massive body shook the branches overhead as Lord Voldemort struggled, desperate. ",
        "\"NO! NO! Harry, WHAT'RE YEH -- ?\" ",
        "\"QUIET!\" shouted Rowle, and with a flick of Rowle Hagrid was silenced. ",
        "Bellatrix, who had leapt to WHAT'RE YEH feet, was looking eagerly from Lord Voldemort to Harry, WHAT'RE YEH breast heaving. The only things that moved were the flames and the snake, coiling and uncoiling in the glittering cage behind Lord Voldemort's head. ",
        "Harry could feel the Elder Wand against Harry chest, but Harry made no attempt to draw it. Harry knew that the snake was too well protected, knew that if Harry managed to point the Elder Wand at Nagini, fifty curses would hit Harry first. And still, Lord Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and now Lord Voldemort tilted his head a little to  ",
        "the side, considering Lord Voldemort standing before Lord Voldemort, and a singularly mirthless smile curled the lipless mouth. ",
        "\"Harry Potter,\" Lord Voldemort said very softly. Lord Voldemort voice might have been part of the spitting fire. \"The Boy Who Lived.\" ",
        "None of the Death Eaters moved. None of the Death Eaters were waiting: Everything was waiting. Hagrid was struggling, and \" ",
        "Bellatrix was panting, and Harry thought inexplicably of Ginny, and Ginny blazing look, and the feel of Ginny lips on Hagrid had raised Hagrid . his head was still tilted to one side, like a curious child, wondering what would happen if Hagrid proceeded. Harry looked back into the red eyes, and wanted it to happen now, quickly, while Harry could still stand, before Harry lost control, before Harry betrayed fear -- ",
        "Harry saw the mouth move and a flash of green light, and everything was gone. ",
        "KING'S CROSS ",
        "KING'S lay facedown, listening to the silence. KING'S was perfectly alone. Nobody was watching. Nobody else was there. KING'S was not perfectly sure that KING'S was there KING'S. ",
        "A long time later, or maybe no time at all, it came to KING'S that KING'S must exist, must be more than disembodied thought, because KING'S was lying, definitely lying, on some surface. Therefore KING'S had a sense of touch, and the thing against which KING'S lay existed too. ",
        "Almost as soon as KING'S had reached this conclusion, Harry became conscious that Harry was naked. Convinced as Harry was of Harry total solitude, this did not concern Harry, but this did intrigue Harry slightly. Harry wondered whether, as Harry could feel, Harry would be able to see. In opening them, Harry discovered that Harry had eyes. ",
        "Harry lay in a bright mist, though it was not like mist Harry had ever experienced before. Harry surroundings were not hidden by cloudy vapor; rather the cloudy vapor ",
        "had not yet formed into surroundings. The floor on which Harry lay seemed to be white, neither warm nor cold, but simply there, a flat, blank something on which to be. ",
        "Harry sat up. His massive body appeared unscathed. Harry touched Harry face. Harry was not wearing glasses anymore. ",
        "Then a noise reached Harry through the unformed nothingness that surrounded Harry: the small soft thumpings of something that flapped, flailed, and struggled. It was a pitiful noise, yet also slightly indecent. Harry had the uncomfortable feeling that Harry was eavesdropping on something furtive, shameful. ",
        "For the first time, Harry wished Harry were clothed. ",
        "Barely had the wish formed in Harry head than robes appeared a short distance away. Harry took the wish formed in his head than robes and pulled the wish formed in his head than robes on: the wish formed in his head than robes were soft, clean, and warm. It was extraordinary how the wish formed in his head than robes had appeared, just like that, the moment Harry had wanted the wish formed in his head than robes. ... ",
        "Harry stood up, looking around. Was Harry in some great Room of Requirement? The longer Harry looked, The more there was to see. A great domed glass roof glittered high above Harry in sunlight. Perhaps A great domed glass roof was a palace. All was hushed and still, except for those odd thumping and whimpering noises coming from somewhere close by in the mist. ... ",
        "Harry turned slowly on the spot, and Harry surroundings seemed to invent his surroundings before his eyes. A wide-open space, bright and clean, a hall larger by far than the Great Hall, with that clear, domed glass ceiling. It was quite empty. Harry was the only person there, except for -- ",
        "Harry recoiled. Harry had spotted the thing that was making the noises. It had the form of a small, naked child, curled on the ground, It skin raw and rough, flayed-looking, and It lay shuddering under a seat where It had been left, unwanted, stuffed out of sight, struggling for breath. ",
        "Harry was afraid of It. Small and fragile and wounded though It was, Harry did not want to approach it was. Nevertheless Harry drew slowly nearer, ready to jump back at any moment. Soon Harry stood near enough to touch it was, yet Harry could not bring Harry to do it was. Harry felt like a coward. Harry ought to comfort it was, but it was repulsed Harry. ",
        "\"You cannot help.\" ",
        "Harry spun around. Albus Dumbledore was walking toward Harry, sprightly and upright, wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue. ",
        "HarryHarry.\" Harry spread Harry arms wide, and Harry hands were both whole and white and undamaged. \"You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk.\" ",
        "Stunned, Harry followed as Albus Dumbledore strode away from where the flayed child lay whimpering, leading Harry to two seats that Harry had not previously noticed, set some distance away under that high, sparkling ceiling. Albus Dumbledore sat down in one of them, and Harry fell into the other, staring at Albus Dumbledore . Albus Dumbledore 's long silver hair and beard, the piercingly blue eyes behind half-moon spectacles, the crooked nose: Everything was as Albus Dumbledore had remembered it. And yet... ",
        "\"But you're dead,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"Oh yes,\" said Albus Dumbledore matter-of-factly. ",
        "\"Then ... I'm dead too?\" ",
        "\"Ah,\" said Albus Dumbledore, smiling still more broadly. \"That is the question, isn't it? On the whole, You wonderful boy, I think not.\" ",
        "They looked at each other, the old man still beaming. \"Not?\" repeated Harry. ",
        "\"Not,\" said Albus Dumbledore. ",
        "\"But ...Harry Harry raised Harry hand instinctively toward the lightning scar. It did not seem to be there. \"But I should have died -- I didn't defend the old man! I meant to let Harry kill me!\" ",
        "\"And that,\" said Albus Dumbledore, \"will, I think, have made all the difference.\" ",
        "Happiness seemed to radiate from Albus Dumbledore like light, like fire: Harry had never seen the old man so utterly, so palpably content. ",
        "\"Explain,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"But you already know,\" said Albus Dumbledore. Albus Dumbledore twiddled Albus Dumbledore thumbs together. ",
        "\"I let the old man kill me,\" said Harry. \"Didn't I?\" ",
        "\"You did,\" said Albus Dumbledore, nodding. \"Go on!\" ",
        "\"So the part of the old man soul that was in me ...Albus Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically, urging Harry onward, a broad smile of encouragement on Harry face. ",
        "\"... has it gone?\" ",
        "\"Oh yes!\" said Albus Dumbledore. \"Yes, Albus Dumbledore destroyed it. ",
        "Your soul is whole, and completely your own, Harry.\" ",
        "\"But then ...Harry Harry glanced over Harry shoulder to where the small, maimed creature trembled under the chair. ",
        "\"What is that, Professor?\" ",
        "\"Something that is beyond either of our help,\" said Albus Dumbledore. ",
        "\"But if Lord Voldemort used the Killing Curse,\" Harry started again, \"and nobody died for me this time -- how can I be alive?\" ",
        "\"I think you know,\" said Albus Dumbledore. \"Think back. Remember what Albus Dumbledore did, in Albus Dumbledore ignorance, in Albus Dumbledore greed and Albus Dumbledore cruelty.\" ",
        "Harry thought. Harry let Harry gaze drift over Harry surroundings. If it was indeed a palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and still, Albus Dumbledore and Albus Dumbledore and the stunted creature under the chair were the only beings there. Then the answer rose to Albus Dumbledore lips easily, without effort. ",
        "\"Albus Dumbledore took my blood,\" said Harry. ",
        "\"Precisely!\" said Albus Dumbledore. \"Albus Dumbledore took my blood and rebuilt Albus Dumbledore living body with my blood! Your blood in Albus Dumbledore veins, Harry, Lily's protection inside both of you! Albus Dumbledore tethered you to life while Albus Dumbledore lives!\" ",
        "\"I live . . . while he lives? But I thought ... I thought it was the other way round! I thought we both had to die? Or is it the same thing?\" ",
        "Albus Dumbledore was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the agonized creature behind them and glanced back at the agonized creature behind them yet again. ",
        "\"Are you sure we both can't do anything?\" ",
        "\"There is no help possible.\" ",
        "\"Then explain ... more,\" said Harry, and Albus Dumbledore smiled. ",
        "\"You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux Albus Dumbledore never meant to make. Albus Dumbledore had rendered his soul so unstable that his soul broke apart when Albus Dumbledore committed those acts of unspeakable evil, the murder of your parents, the attempted killing of a child. But what escaped from that room was even less than Albus Dumbledore knew. Albus Dumbledore left more than his living body behind. Albus Dumbledore left part of Albus Dumbledore latched to you, the would-be victim who had survived. ",
        "\"And Albus Dumbledore knowledge remained woefully incomplete, Harry! That which Lord Voldemort does not value, which Voldemort takes no trouble to comprehend. Of house-elves and children's tales, of love, loyalty, and innocence, Lord Voldemort knows and understands nothing. Nothing. That they all have a power beyond his own, a power beyond the reach of any magic, is a truth his has never grasped. ",
        "\"his took my blood believing my blood would strengthen his. his took into his a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when your mother died for you. his keeps your mother sacrifice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Lord Voldemort's one last hope for Lord Voldemort.Albus Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at Albus Dumbledore. ",
        "\"And you knew this? You knew -- all along?\" ",
        "\"I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good,\" said Albus Dumbledore happily, and my guesses sat in silence for what seemed like a long time, while the creature behind my guesses continued to whimper and tremble. ",
        "\"There's more,\" said Harry. \"There's more to it. Why did my wand break the wand my wand borrowed?\" ",
        "\"As to that, I cannot be sure.\" ",
        "\"Have a guess, then,\" said Harry, and Dumbledore laughed. ",
        "\"What you must understand, Harry, is that you and Lord Voldemort have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested. But here is what I think happened, and it is unprecedented, and no wandmaker could, I think, ever have predicted it or explained it to Lord Voldemort. ",
        "\"Without meaning to, as you now know, Lord Voldemort doubled the bond between you when Lord Voldemort returned to a human form. A part of Lord Voldemort was still attached to Harry, and, thinking to strengthen Lord Voldemort, Lord Voldemort took a part of your mother's sacrifice into Lord Voldemort. If Lord Voldemort could only have understood the precise and terrible power of your mother's sacrifice, Lord Voldemort would not, perhaps, have dared to touch your blood. ... But then, if Lord Voldemort had been able to understand, Lord Voldemort could not be Lord Voldemort, and might never have murdered at all. ",
        "\"Having ensured this two-fold connection, having wrapped your destinies together more securely than ",
        "ever two wizards were joined in history, Lord Voldemort proceeded to attack you with a wand that shared a core with Harry. And now something very strange happened, as we know. The cores reacted in a way that Lord Voldemort, who never knew that a wand that shared a core with yours was twin of a wand that shared a core with yours, had never expected. ",
        "\"a wand that shared a core with yours was more afraid than you were that night, Harry. You had accepted, even embraced, the possibility of death, something Lord Voldemort has never been able to do. Your courage won, a wand that shared a core with yours overpowered Lord Voldemort. And in doing so, something happened between those wands, something that echoed the relationship between those wands masters. ",
        "\"I believe that a wand that shared a core with yours imbibed some of the power and qualities of Lord Voldemort's wand that night, which is to say that it contained a little of Lord Voldemort Lord Voldemort. So a wand that shared a core with yours recognized Lord Voldemort when Lord Voldemort pursued you, recognized a man who was both kin and mortal enemy, and it regurgitated some of Lord Voldemort own magic against Lord Voldemort, magic much more powerful than anything Lucius's wand had ever performed. a wand that shared a core with yours now contained the power of your enormous courage and of Lord Voldemort's own deadly skill: What chance did that poor stick of Lucius Malfoy's stand?\" ",
        "\"But if a wand that shared a core with yours was so powerful, how come Hermione was able to break a wand that shared a core with yours?\" asked Harry. ",
        "\"My dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed only at Lord Voldemort, who had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only toward Lord Voldemort was that wand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a wand like any other ... though a good one, I am sure,Albus Dumbledore finished kindly. ",
        "Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was very hard to be sure of things like time, here. ",
        "\"Harry killed me with a wand that shared a core with yours.\" ",
        "\"Harry failed to kill you with a wand that shared a core with yours,Albus Dumbledore corrected Harry. \"I think we can agree that you are not dead -- though, of course,\" Harry added, as if fearing Harry had been discourteous, \"I do not minimize your sufferings, which I am sure were severe.\" ",
        "\"I feel great at the moment, though,\" said Harry, looking down at Harry clean, unblemished hands. \"Where are we, exactly?\" ",
        "\"Well, I was going to ask you that,\" said Albus Dumbledore, looking around. \"Where would you say that we are?\" ",
        "Until Albus Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known. Now, however, Albus Dumbledore found that Albus Dumbledore had an answer ready to give. ",
        "\"It looks,\" Albus Dumbledore said slowly, \"like King's Cross station. Except a lot cleaner and empty, and there are no trains as far as I can see.\" ",
        "\"King's Cross station!\" Albus Dumbledore was chuckling immoderately. \"Good gracious, really?\" ",
        "\"Well, where do you think we are?\" asked Harry, a little defensively. ",
        "\"My dear boy, I have no idea. This is, as they say, your party.\" ",
        "Harry had no idea what this meant; Albus Dumbledore was being infuriating. Harry glared at Albus Dumbledore, then remembered ",
        "a much more pressing question than that of their current location. ",
        "\"The Deathly Hallows,\" Harry said, and Harry was glad to see that the words wiped the smile from Albus Dumbledore's face. ",
        "\"Ah, yes,\" Harry said. Harry even looked a little worried. \"Well?\" ",
        "For the first time since Harry had met Albus Dumbledore, Harry looked less than an old man, much less. Harry looked fleetingly like a small boy caught in wrongdoing. ",
        "\"Can you forgive me?\" Harry said. \"Can you forgive me for not trusting you? For not telling you? Harry, I only feared that you would fail as I had failed. I only dreaded that you would make my mistakes. I crave your pardon, Harry. I have known, for some time now, that you are the better man.\" ",
        "\"What are you talking about?\" asked Harry, startled by Albus Dumbledore's tone, by the sudden tears in Harry eyes. ",
        "\"The Hallows, the Hallows,\" murmured Albus Dumbledore. \"A desperate man's dream!\" ",
        "\"But they're real!\" ",
        "\"Real, and dangerous, and a lure for fools,\" said Albus Dumbledore. \"And I was such a fool. But you know, don't you? I have no secrets from you anymore. You know.\" ",
        "\"What do I know?Albus Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore turned Albus Dumbledore whole body to face Harry, and tears still sparkled in the brilliantly blue eyes. ",
        "\"Master of death, Harry, master of Death! Was I better, ultimately, than Lord Voldemort?\" ",
        "\"Of course you were,\" said Harry. \"Of course -- how can you ask that? You never killed if you could avoid it!\" ",
        "\"True, true,\" said Albus Dumbledore, and Albus Dumbledore was like a child seeking reassurance. \"Yet I too sought a way to conquer death, Harry.\" ",
        "\"Not the way Albus Dumbledore did,\" said Harry. After all Albus Dumbledore anger at Albus Dumbledore, how odd it was to sit here, beneath the high, vaulted ceiling, and defend Albus Dumbledore from Albus Dumbledore. \"Hallows, not Horcruxes.\" ",
        "\"Hallows,\" murmured Dumbledore, \"not Horcruxes. Precisely.\" ",
        "There was a pause. The creature behind them whimpered, but Harry no longer looked around. ",
        "\"Grindelwald was looking for them too?\" Harry asked. ",
        "Albus Dumbledore closed Harry eyes for a moment and nodded. ",
        "\"It was the thing, above all, that drew us together,\" Harry said quietly. \"Two clever, arrogant boys with a shared obsession. Harry wanted to come to Godric's Hollow, as I am sure you have guessed, because of the grave of Ignotus Peverell. Harry wanted to explore the place the third brother had died.\" ",
        "\"So it's true?\" asked Harry. \"All of it? The Peverell brothers -- \" ",
        "\" -- were the three brothers of the tale,\" said Albus Dumbledore, nodding. \"Oh yes, I think so. Whether Dumbledore, nodding met Death on a lonely road ... I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of the Peverell brothers being Death's own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations. ",
        "\"The Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through the ages, father to son, mother to daughter, right down to Ignotus's last living descendant, who was born, as Ignotus was, in the village of Godric's Hollow.Albus Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore smiled at Harry. ",
        "\"Me?\" ",
        "\"You. You have guessed, I know, why \"The Cloak was in my possession on the night your parents died. James had showed \"The Cloak to me just a few days previously. \"The Cloak explained much of James undetected wrong-doing at school! I could hardly believe what I was seeing. I asked to borrow \"The Cloak, to examine \"The Cloak. I had long since given up my dream of uniting the Hallows, but I could not resist, could not help taking a closer look. ... It was \"The Cloak the likes of which I had never seen, immensely old, perfect in every respect . . . and then your father died, and I had the Hallows at last, all to me!\" ",
        "me tone was unbearably bitter. ",
        "\"\"The Cloak wouldn't have helped them survive, though,Harry Harry said quickly. \"Lord Voldemort knew where my mum and dad were. \"The Cloak \"The Cloak couldn't have made my mum and dad curse-proof.\" ",
        "\"True,\" sighed Albus Dumbledore. \"True.Harry Harry waited, but Albus Dumbledore did not speak, so Albus Dumbledore prompted Albus Dumbledore. ",
        "\"So you'd given up looking for the Hallows when you saw \"The Cloak?\" ",
        "\"Oh yes,\" said Albus Dumbledore faintly. It seemed that Albus Dumbledore forced Albus Dumbledore to meet Harry's eyes. \"You know what happened. You know. You cannot despise me more than I despise Albus Dumbledore.\" ",
        "\"But I don't despise you -- \" ",
        "\"Then you should,\" said Albus Dumbledore. Albus Dumbledore drew a deep breath. \"You know the secret of my sister's ill health, what those Muggles did, what Muggles became. You know how your father sought revenge, and paid the price, died in Azkaban. You know how my mother gave up my mother own life to care for Ariana. ",
        "\"I resented it, Harry.Albus Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore stated it baldly, coldly. Albus Dumbledore was looking now over the top of Harry's head, into the distance. ",
        "\"I was gifted, I was brilliant. I wanted to escape. I wanted to shine. I wanted glory. ",
        "\"Do not misunderstand me,\" Albus Dumbledore said, and pain crossed the face so that Albus Dumbledore looked ancient again. \"I loved them. I loved my parents, I loved my brother and my sister, but I was selfish, Harry, more selfish than you, who are a remarkably selfless person, could possibly imagine. ",
        "\"So that, when my mother died, and I was left the responsibility of a damaged sister and a wayward ",
        "brother, I returned to my village in anger and bitterness. Trapped and wasted, I thought! And then, of course, he came. ...\" ",
        "Albus Dumbledore looked directly into Harry's eyes again. ",
        "\"Grindelwald. You cannot imagine how Albus Dumbledore ideas caught me, Harry, inflamed me. Muggles forced into subservience. We wizards triumphant. \"Grindelwald and I, the glorious young leaders of the revolution. ",
        "\"Oh, I had a few scruples. I assuaged my conscience with empty words. It would all be for the greater good, and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits for We wizards triumphant. Did I know, in my heart of hearts, what \"Grindelwald was? I think I did, but I closed Harry's eyes. If the plans We were making came to fruition, all my dreams would come true. ",
        "\"And at the heart of We schemes, the Deathly Hallows! How they fascinated \"Grindelwald, how they fascinated both of We! The unbeatable wand, the weapon that would lead We to power! The Resurrection Stone -- to \"Grindelwald, though I pretended not to know it, it meant an army of Inferi! To me, I confess, it meant the return of my parents, and the lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders. ",
        "\"And \"The Cloak ... somehow, We never discussed \"The Cloak much, Harry. both of us could conceal We well enough without the Cloak, the true magic of which, of course, is that it can be used to protect and shield others as well as it owner. I thought that, if We ever found it, it might be useful in hiding Ariana, but We interest in \"The Cloak was mainly that \"The Cloak completed the trio, for the legend said that the man who united all three objects would then be truly master of death, which We took to mean 'invincible.' ",
        "\"Invincible masters of death, Grindelwald and Albus Dumbledore! Two months of insanity, of cruel dreams, and neglect of the only two members of my family left to me. ",
        "\"And then ... you know what happened. Reality returned in the form of my rough, unlettered, and infinitely more admirable brother. I did not want to hear the truths he shouted at me. I did not want to hear that I could not set forth to seek Hallows with a fragile and unstable sister in tow. ",
        "\"The argument became a fight. \"Grindelwald lost control. That which I had always sensed in \"Grindelwald, though I pretended not to, now sprang into terrible being. And Ariana . . . after all my mother's care and caution ... lay dead upon the floor.Albus Dumbledore gave a little gasp and began to cry in earnest. Harry reached out and was glad to find that Harry could touch Harry: Harry gripped Harry arm tightly and Albus Dumbledore gradually regained control. ",
        "\"Well, \"Grindelwald fled, as anyone but I could have predicted. Harry vanished, with Harry plans for seizing power, and Harry schemes for Muggle torture, and Harry dreams of the Hallows, dreams in which I had encouraged Harry and helped Harry. Harry ran, while I was left to bury my sister, and learn to live with my guilt and my terrible grief, the price of my shame. ",
        "\"Years passed. There were rumors about Harry. They said Harry had procured a wand of immense power. I, meanwhile, was offered the post of Minister of Magic, not once, but several times. Naturally, I refused. I had learned that I was not to be trusted with power.\" ",
        "\"But you'd have been better, much better, than Fudge or Scrimgeour!\" burst out Harry. ",
        "\"Would I?\" asked Albus Dumbledore heavily. \"I am not so sure. I had proven, as a very young man, that power was my weakness and my temptation. that power is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon those who have never sought it, and take up the mantle because those who have never sought it must, and find to those who have never sought it own surprise that those who have never sought it wear it well. ",
        "\"I was safer at Hogwarts. I think I was a good teacher ",
        "\"You were the best -- \" ",
        "\" -- you are very kind, Harry. But while I busied myself with the training of young wizards, ",
        "\"Grindelwald was raising an army. They say Harry feared me, and perhaps Harry did, but less, I think, than I feared Harry. ",
        "\"Oh, not death,\" said Albus Dumbledore, in answer to Harry's questioning look. \"Not what Harry could do to myself magically. I knew that we were evenly matched, perhaps that I was a shade more skillful. It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of we, in that last, horrific fight, had actually cast the curse that killed my sister. You may call me cowardly: You would be right. Harry, I dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been I who brought about my sister death, not merely through my arrogance and stupidity, but that I actually struck the blow that snuffed out my sister life. ",
        "\"I think Harry knew it, I think Harry knew what frightened me. I delayed meeting Harry until finally, it would have been too shameful to resist any longer. People were dying and Harry seemed unstoppable, and I had to do what I could. ",
        "\"Well, you know what happened next. I won the duel. ",
        "I won a wand of immense power.\" ",
        "Another silence. Harry did not ask whether Albus Dumbledore had ever found out who struck Ariana dead. Harry did not want to know, and even less did Harry want Albus Dumbledore to have to tell Albus Dumbledore. At last Harry knew what Albus Dumbledore would have seen when Harry looked in the Mirror of Erised, and why Albus Dumbledore had been so understanding of the fascination it had exercised over Harry. ",
        "They sat in silence for a long time, and the whimperings of The creature behind them They barely disturbed Harry anymore. ",
        "At last Harry said, \"\"Grindelwald tried to stop Lord Voldemort going after a wand of immense power. Harry lied, you know, pretended Harry had never had a wand of immense power.Albus Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore nodded, looking down at Harry lap, tears still glittering on the crooked nose. ",
        "\"They say Harry showed remorse in later years, alone in Harry cell at Nurmengard. I hope that it is true. I would like to think Harry did feel the horror and shame of what Harry had done. Perhaps that lie to Lord Voldemort was Harry attempt to make amends ... to prevent Lord Voldemort from taking the Hallow ...\" ",
        "\"... or maybe from breaking into your tomb?\" suggested Harry, and Albus Dumbledore dabbed Albus Dumbledore eyes. ",
        "After another short pause Harry said, \"You tried to use the Resurrection Stone.Albus Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore nodded. ",
        "\"When I discovered the Resurrection Stone, after all those years, buried in the abandoned home of the Gaunts -- the Hallow I had craved most of all, though in my youth I had wanted the Resurrection Stone for very different reasons -- I lost my head, Harry. I quite forgot that it was now a Horcrux, that the ring was sure to carry a curse. I picked the ring up, and I put the ring on, and for a second I imagined that I was about to see Ariana, and my mother, and my father, and to tell I was about to see Ariana, and my mother, and my father how very, very sorry I was. ... ",
        "\"I was such a fool, Harry. After all those years I had learned nothing. I was unworthy to unite the Hallows, I had proved the Hallows time and again, and here was final proof.\" ",
        "\"Why?\" said Harry. \"It was natural! You wanted to see I was about to see Ariana, and my mother, and my father again. What's wrong with that?\" ",
        "\"Maybe a man in a million could unite the Hallows, Harry. I was fit only to possess the meanest of I was about to see Ariana, and my mother, and my father, the least extraordinary. I was fit to own a wand of immense power, and not to boast of a wand of immense power, and not to kill with a wand of immense power. I was permitted to tame and to use a wand of immense power, because I took a wand of immense power, not for gain, but to save others from a wand of immense power. ",
        "\"But \"The Cloak, I took out of vain curiosity, and so \"The Cloak could never have worked for me as \"The Cloak works for you, \"The Cloak true owner. The stone I would have used in an attempt to drag back those who are at peace, rather than to enable my self-sacrifice, as you did. You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows.\" ",
        "Albus Dumbledore patted Harry's hand, and Harry looked up at the old man and smiled; Harry could not help Harry. How could Harry remain angry with Albus Dumbledore now? ",
        "\"Why did you have to make it so difficult?\" ",
        "Albus Dumbledore's smile was tremulous. ",
        "\"I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry. I was afraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart. I was scared that, if presented outright with the facts about those tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. If you laid hands on presented outright with the facts about those tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons, I wanted you to possess presented outright with the facts about those tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons safely. You are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from Death. ",
        "the true master accepts that the true master must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.\" ",
        "\"And Lord Voldemort never knew about the Hallows?\" ",
        "\"I do not think so, because Lord Voldemort did not recognize the Resurrection Stone. But even if Lord Voldemort had known about them, Harry, I doubt that Lord Voldemort would have been interested in any except the first. Lord Voldemort would not think that Lord Voldemort needed \"The Cloak, and as for the Resurrection Stone, whom would Lord Voldemort want to bring back from the dead? Lord Voldemort fears the dead. Lord Voldemort does not love.\" ",
        "\"But you expected Lord Voldemort to go after a wand of immense power?\" ",
        "\"I have been sure that Lord Voldemort would try, ever since your wand beat Lord Voldemort's in the graveyard of Little Hangleton. At first, Lord Voldemort was afraid that you had conquered Lord Voldemort by superior skill. Once Lord Voldemort had kidnapped Ollivander, however, Lord Voldemort discovered the existence of the twin cores. Lord Voldemort thought that explained everything. Yet a wand of immense power did no better against yours! So Lord Voldemort, instead of asking Lord Voldemort what quality it was in you that had made a wand of immense power so strong, what gift you possessed that Lord Voldemort did not, naturally set out to find a wand of immense power that, they said, would beat any other. For Lord Voldemort, a wand of immense powerhas become an obsession to rival a wand of immense power obsession with you. a wand of immense power believes that a wand of immense power removes a wand of immense power last weakness and makes a wand of immense power truly invincible. Poor Severus ...\" ",
        "\"If you planned your death with Snape, you meant Snape to end up with a wand of immense power, didn't you?\" ",
        "\"I admit that was my intention,\" said Albus Dumbledore, \"but it did not work as I intended, did it?\" ",
        "\"No,\" said Harry. \"That bit didn't work out.\" ",
        "The creature behind them jerked and moaned, and Harry and Albus Dumbledore sat without talking for the longest time yet. The realization of what would happen next settled gradually over Harry in the long minutes, like softly falling snow. ",
        "\"I've got to go back, haven't I?\" ",
        "\"That is up to you.\" ",
        "\"I've got a choice?\" ",
        "\"Oh yes.\" Albus Dumbledore smiled at Albus Dumbledore. \"We are in King's Cross, you say? I think that if you decided not to go back, you would be able to ... let's say ... board a train.\" ",
        "\"And where would it take me?\" ",
        "\"On,\" said Albus Dumbledore simply. ",
        "Silence again. ",
        "Lord Voldemort's got a wand of immense power.\" ",
        "\"True. Lord Voldemort has a wand of immense power.\" ",
        "\"But you want me to go back?\" ",
        "\"I think,\" said Albus Dumbledore, \"that if you choose to return, there is a chance that Albus Dumbledore may be finished for good. I cannot promise it. But I know this, Harry, that you have less to fear from returning here than Harry does.\" ",
        "Harry glanced again at the raw-looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair. ",
        "\"Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all, those who live without love. By returning, you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed, fewer families are torn apart. If that seems to you a worthy goal, then We say good-bye for the present.\" ",
        "Harry nodded and sighed. Leaving this place would not be nearly as hard as walking into the forest had been, but this place was warm and light and peaceful here, and Harry knew that Harry was heading back to pain and the fear of more loss. Harry stood up, and Albus Dumbledore did the same, and they looked for a long moment into each other's faces. ",
        "\"Tell me one last thing,\" said Harry. \"Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?Albus Dumbledore beamed at Harry, and Albus Dumbledore voice sounded loud and strong in Harry's ears even though the bright mist was descending again, obscuring Harry figure. ",
        "\"Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?\" * "
